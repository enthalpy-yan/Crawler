Had the amazing Sam's Sundae because I heard that it was supposed to be great - definitely was. The flavor wasn't what I was expecting, but it was just what I wanted without knowing I wanted it. If you are looking for something to change it up, this is the thing to try. Also had the Tcho hot chocolate here, which was really good, but it was also super rich, almost too rich for me. Still drank it all though hah!

YUMMY ICE CREAM! During our trip to SF, my family and I rushed over here after dinner on our last night in SF in order to catch a taste of the famous Bi-Rite before closing time. First of all, parking is rather impossible, but that's the most challenging part. The line is quite long, but it moves pretty fast and it's well worth it. The staff is very patient and good with samples. The prices are not super overpriced like some ice cream places can be. I got  Salted Caramel & Rincella. VERY happy with Rincella, but Salted Caramel was too salty for me. It tasted rather burnt. If in the area, I would definitely hit up Bi-Rite again!

Everybody was bugging me to try Bi-Rite ice cream! So after dinner, my friend dragged me to complete the San Fran experience! Unfortunately there was a HUGE line - which kept on growing longer as we struggled to find parking in the area! When you finally get to the counter, you are able to see the ice cream selection - which in my opinion is limited! Maybe 8 flavors total? The ice cream is, however, very delicious - and the servers are happy to let you sample the flavors. I tried the salted caramel and thought it was a bit too strong. So I ended up getting the Mint Chip and Chocolate instead - 2 scoops on top of a sugar cone ($3.50). The ice cream very flavorful but not too heavy. Definitely hit the spot after dinner! Limited seating inside and outside! But most people seem to slam down their ice cream and go!

After hiking in Twin Peaks, gorging myself with an Ike's sandwich, I still managed to have the stomach room for a little dessert (although just a kid's cup). ICE CREAM SALTED CARAMEL ICE CREAM: I was expecting regular, smooth ice cream but was excited to find chunks of caramel in it (like toffee). It gave the ice cream a nice crunchy texture. This was a really rich flavor and I could barely finish my kid's cup. HONEY LAVENDER: I only sampled this one but it had a nice light flavor that wasn't too sweet. I actually wish it had a stronger lavender flavor. I tried lavender cookies and candies from Japan and I liked the strong aroma. Sample spoons are huuuge! I am very sure I got a bit of brain freeze from only trying two samples. Not to mention it was slightly awkward to be savoring the ice cream in my mouth while trying to explain my order to the clerk behind the counter. But I am grateful for the generous samples, yay! WAIT TIME - Okay seriously felt like I was in Disneyland waiting to get on a ride. But instead of waiting for a roller coaster, my reward was a cup of sweet deliciousness. It really was the perfect treat on a warm, sunny SF afternoon (although our wait in line was interrupted with intermittent cold wind so I was confused if I should keep my ultralight down jacket on or not). I'm not sure if I would want to wait 30 mins again next time. The diverse flavors reminds me of Ici in Berkeley (and the prices are cheaper, too). I'm always a sucker for ice cream and gelato so this place has always been on my to-try list. Overall, good gourmet ice cream. If there is no line I will not hesitate to pop back in for another treat in the future. I can never say no to ice cream!

My first trip to Bi-Rite Creamery was the day after I had my wisdom teeth taken out. This terrible vicodin-inspired idea that I was going to make the most out of the situation and go on an ice-cream tour around the city led me to Bi-Rite Creamery, which I had only known about because of the around-the-corner lines I'd seen from Dolores Park. I timed it to show up during the work week, and I'm really glad I did. It was the only pure deliciousness I was allowed that day, and no one laughed at or commented on my swollen jowls! (To my face.) My trip back yesterday was far more pleasant. My friend and I mercifully skipped the endless line by buying a pint of salted caramel (their most popular, and for good reason) and getting two spoons to take back to the park. I loved how despite sitting in what passes for sun in this city, their ice cream maintains great consistency and didn't seem to melt much at all until the pint was nearly gone. Moral of the story: There's a reason there's always a line. Go find out why. Other moral of the story: Don't do the ice cream tour thing after getting your wisdom teeth out. All those painkillers made the trip to Humphrey Slocombe's very surreal.

I was so excited to try this famous ice cream place. It has so many impressive reviews! After a huge lunch in the city even though I was more than full I still dragged my family here. My aunt who even lives in LA had heard of this little gem. We made our way to the Mission and I was quite surprised by how small this ice cream place was. I would imagine it to be much bigger! After reading all the reviews all I knew I had to get salted caramel and roasted banana. What a good decision!! The roasted banana was rich and creamy with perfect flavor. I would never of thought I would like a roasted banana ice cream, but I fell in love. The salted caramel was perfect as well, but that's no surprise since salted caramel is one of my favorite combinations. I was also able to try the snicker doodle and vanilla. The vanilla was anything but plain, it was creamy and decadent. The snicker doodle had a very strong cinnamon flavor but was still a real treat.  Honestly, everything was more than good, it was hands down some of the best ice cream I have ever had. I am lucky we had no line (might of been because it was foggy?) but I would stand in a line for these sweet treats!

My roommate and I decided to venture into SF to satisfy our ice cream craving. We took the bus from Berkeley to SF and took the Muni all the way to Mission. When we arrived at Bi-Rite, there was already a line. That wasn't surprising since I was forewarned of a long wait. I knew I had to order the salted caramel since it's their signature flavor. BUT then I couldn't decide what other flavor to get. TOO MANY CHOICES! I finally ended up getting ginger because I love ginger! OMG I will swear by the salted caramel. It is divine! So rich and creamy. I really liked the ginger too, and I thought it went really well with the salted caramel (good job Judy for your awesome ice cream pairing skills). I can't remember what my roommate ordered but she liked hers too. I think you can't go wrong with any flavor at Bi-Rite. After we finally got our ice cream, we went over to Dolores Park and just hung out and enjoyed the sunshine. Definitely a fun and successful ice cream adventure!

Decent. Personally, whenever I've gotten the ice cream here, it's just seemed like the texture was too icy. It doesn't have the soft, creaminess that I look for, but maybe that's just personal preference. The flavor selection is great, but I grew up eating honey-lavender ice cream at the Scoop in Marin, so forgive me for being unimpressed with their creativity. My recommendation is to skip the line for the main ice cream and get the SOFT SERVE! On Sundays it's chocolate and salted caramel (Twist? Yes, please.). You can step in the line and be in Dolores Park with ice cream in hand ten minutes later even on a sunny day. The line is normally about a quarter of the length of the main line, and what you sacrifice in selection you save in time and human dignity (Because really... You're going to wait in line for an hour to get an ice cream?).... Another bonus: the soft serve doesn't have the aforementioned icy texture. Yay!

This place is great - a while back we did a double blind taste test we held it beat most other ice cream places with the exception of Mitchell's. Well, for me they even beat Mitchell's but I was only one vote. And we could only use normal flavors - cookies and cream and chocolate - so none of the awesome flavors that make Bi-Rite great were taken into account. Even though it's good, the line out the door is still ridiculous. However, the line can be bypassed by those buying pints so when I want ice cream I'll double park nearby and have my friend run in and grab a pint or three (one or two for me, one for them for their trouble).  Still, every so often it's worth waiting in one of those lines - maybe now that my little cousin is visiting me I'll have an excuse to go again...

Delicious ice cream spot in SF.  Worth a visit if you are in the neighborhood.  The flavors are somewhat artisanal most known for their salted carmel.  I'm a fan of the roasted banana, yum.  The toppings they offer are all homemade and taste great.  If you want to avoid the lines you can order soft serve at their side window and if you buy a cake or pint you don't have to wait in the long line, and there always is one.

I came here 2x over a long weekend but I would be back more often if I could. This stuff is delicious! Some of the scoops I loved: Brown sugar w/ginger caramel - subtly sweet. ginger wasn't too strong but I liked the textural contrast provided by the caramel ribbon Meyer lemon - bright but subdued by creaminess. yum Toasted coconut - excellent. perfect creamy balance for the sorbet I also tried a lick of the Salted Caramel - it was tasty but as aggressively salty as the version at Molly Moon's (Seattle).

Kid insisted we stop here for some ice cream after dinner. The line was super long so we figured this must be amazing stuff. When I think of amazing ice cream worth lining up for I think of Fentons in Oakland and Laperts in Hawaii. Bi-Rite was really rather meh. We had salted caramel, honey lavender, hazelnut with cocoa nibs and orange cardamom. None of the flavors blew us away and some of them tasted somewhat watered down.  Just not all that.

ummm BEST ICE CREAM EVER. I'm from socal and was touring SF and numerous friends told me I had to try Bi-Rite and my oh my this ice cream is GOOOOOD. Didn't know what to expect at first, didn't even know if it was the right place when me and my bf were walking down the street because there wasn't really a line, which I thought was understandable since it was 7pm. Waited 10 min then ordered HAZELNUT and ROASTED BANANA in a single serving 2 scoops in a cone : ) My world was rocked so hard that I had a dream about that ice cream that night. I wish I could say I was exaggerating but if you're in the area, you have to try this place. I tried my bf's flavors too and they were just as good! Pretty sure you can't go wrong w anything you get here. What's so good about the ice cream is the creamy texture, the right amount of flavor and it's just so smooth and delicious. Pretty reasonable price too. If only they had a location in socal...

You don't hold a following like Bi-Rite without reason. This joint is an ice cream staple across the globe and it shows. Staff let us in just before proper opening time and handed us every sample we could handle in a real metal spoon. Not that that is the gold standard, but a pretty nice touch. I might have sampled a half dozen, but landed solidly on the brown sugar variety. Mild, easy, rounded and just enough sweet. I'm not much of an ice cream guy, but it shows just how much love goes into each flavor. Honorable mention for the roasted banana. I've never had ice cream that tasted that good. Ever. I can see this place in the summertime with a line down the street. That's a sight I would love to see indeed. Tons of bottled beverages, too. Saw some Stumptown Coffee and tons of old-school bottled sodas. Good stuff. Truly a wonderful spot and worthy of the reputation. I'll go back whenever I can!

My favorite place for ice cream! I went here every day for four days since it was that good. Favorite flavors: the one with peanut butter, honey lavender, salted caramel, pistachio, dark chocolate. I ended trying mostly different flavors every day (3 scoops each day) and it never disappointed! Service is also really friendly! If you change your mind they will accommodate you! I changed my mind once about the order of flavors and the guy said I should get what I want. Warning: the line is ridic long during weekends. If you want to try it without the line wrapping around the block, visit on a weekday! I think it's worth it! P.S. their salted lavender cookies are delicious.

Went with my brother and sister-in-law on a sunny Saturday afternoon. The line wasn't too bad, we only waited 10-15 minutes, if that. They have a nice variety of flavors. I sampled the honey lavender and the orange cardamom. I opted to order the latter. It was good. I enjoyed it a lot. Through my brother and sister-in-law, I also got to sample the caramel chocolate sea salt something-or-other (it was ok), the chocolate peanut butter (REALLY good, but I prefer more peanut butter than chocolate, so a little unbalanced for me), the cookies & cream (eh) and the coffee toffee (pretty good). All-in-all, the ice cream is good, the service was fantastic, and I wasn't bothered by the line. Only reason Bi-Rite doesn't 5/5 is that I think Humphry Slocombe is better. Bi-Rite's flavors are nice and definitely satisfying, but Humphry Slocombe is just more adventurous with flavors, which I like, and they're still my SF favorite for ice cream.

Good ice cream...but not the ice-cream place I'd go if I'm in SF. A little overrated in my opinion, sorry.  The scoops are rather small, probably good to get at least a single scoop for one person. Lots of interesting flavor options though. An advantage Bi-rite has is that it's next to the park so that you can easily grab a cup/cone to go and enjoy it at the park. Very limited indoor and outdoor seating. You can try different flavors before you decide, came here with 2 friends and shared a double with 3 scoops since we just had brunch. Got the ginger, coffee toffee, and mandarine. The ginger and the mandarine tasted a little similar and are a little sweet, but good blend with the coffee flavor. Service was fast but impersonal (lady who helped us looked impatient while she was waiting for us to decide on flavors). Also tried their salted caramel before but wasn't that impressed. I prefer Mitchells, Humphry Slocombe, and Smitten over Bi-rite....

Good ice cream, but I think there was too much hype and it built up my expectations. I wouldn't wait in line for more than half an hour here. I definitely recommend the toasted coconut. I got the honey lavender and it tasted like a flower. I didn't like it and my friend couldn't even finish it. I tried the Ricanelas and it was pretty good. If I had more, then it would probably get too sweet. *note: my boyfriend wrote this review. i still want to try this place

Supposedly this place has been rated the best ice-cream in America. I'm not sure how one goes about rating ice cream places, but it was pretty f***ing good, I'll give you that. I was out with a co-worker for a long-overdue "man date" (where two old dudes talk about their families and work) - when afterwards my co-worker suggested we check this place out. Grabbed the smallest cup they had of their salted caramel and it was as good if not better than the places in Seattle (Molly Moons for one) that I've been to. Its' only a shame that I don't live in SF so I can't be taking home pints of this stuff. Or maybe that's a good thing.

You know that Bi-Rite Creamery is something special when the temperature is in the low 40's and dropping, wet and rainy, and people are still waiting in line to eat ice cream. The line didn't go pass the door, but for the entire time we were there sitting inside and enjoying our ice cream, people kept coming in. With so much to choose from I didn't know where to start, but there was a sign, "Everyday is like sundae" and coincidentally I was wearing my Morrissey t-shirt so I took that as a sign and had a sundae! I went for the unusual, Sam's Sundae- chocolate ice cream with bergamot olive oil, maldon sea salt and whipped cream. I like different, but this didn't sing to me.  The olive oil was too floral and there was just too much of it pooling at the bottom of the cup for me to enjoy. I'm glad I tried it, but now will move on. The Banana Split with caramelized bananas, vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, whipped cream, and toasted walnuts was amazing just to look at and was equally delicious. The banana's were cut lengthwise and the flat side was beautifully caramelized looking smooth, sweet, and shiny like the top of a creme brûlée.  Talk about an elevated banana split! The Toffee Sundae - housemade almond toffee, coffee toffee ice cream, hot fudge, whipped cream, and marcona almonds was also a winner. The toffee was excellent and provided a nice crunch without being too thick and hard and didn't irritate by sticking to my teeth. Bi-Rite Creamery is easily one of my top two neighborhood dessert shops in the city.  If I loved it in the freezing cold, it's gotta be a-ma-zing during a lazy summer day, but no matter the weather - count me in!

Rite-on Bi-Rite!!   After journeying on the BART and walking several blocks from the station, I was thankful for my reward when we finally reached Bi-Rite Creamery: A "short' line. When our group (of 6) finally arrived our destination, I was told that the people we observed waiting comprised a "short" line.  We readily took our place in line while we tried to decide what flavors we to order.  After much, much deliberation (I made up my mind at the last minute as usual), I decided on a double portion of salted caramel and earl grey.   The verdict: Tremendously good.  Simply delicious.  The ice cream is flavorful and not overly sweet.  Out of the 2 flavors I chose, the salted caramel was my favorite!   And lastly, yes of course, the ice cream was the other reward, but I was told from some of the group that the line can get very, very long.  We found out just how long the line can get later when eating our ice cream standing on the side walk:  I think the line stretched possibly around the corner.  Yikes!!  The line looked twice as long than when we had arrived.   Bottom Line:  Definitely worth the wait in a short OR long line.  The ice cream is truly delicious.  I most certainly hope to return during a future trip.

Okay. I've been on a Gelato/Frozen Yogurt crave for about a year and ice-cream just really doesn't excite me anymore. One of my gf's friends stated that this place had really really good ice-cream and that we had to try it out. With 5,000+ reviews and a recommendation from our amigo who lives in the area, we had to check it out to see if it lived up to the hype. SUPER OMG JESUSSS. This place may have THE best ice-cream my tongue has ever gotten into contact with you. I got the Malted Vanilla with Chocolate Pieces and Chocolate with Caramel (I think) in their large size cup (5 bucks). I enjoyed every spoon I took of my ice-cream. It was very rich, decadent, and just tasted so good. Me and my gf ate inside and the ice-cream was already starting to melt (not sure if that's "normal". My GF got the Salted Caramel which I thought was pretty good, but I wasn't in love with it. This place also sells other baked goods/sweets like: cookies, sundaes, cakes, pints of their famous ice-cream, sauces, etc. If I am ever back in the area I will definitely come back!

When is ice-cream worth waiting 45 minutes for? When it's this good! I never thought that any ice cream could justify that kind of line (and you may agree), but try the salted caramel and you'll be swayed like I was. This is not ice cream the way you know ice cream. It's time to wake up those taste buds and hold on for the ride.

Came here on a Saturday night at 10pm. Line is around the block. It was stone-cold freezing, but all these crazy NorCal hipsters were down for some ice cream (myself included). I tried the honey lavender and the salted caramel. Someone told me the salted caramel tasted burnt. and even tastes like toffee. For me, the salted caramel tasted like heaven. The honey lavender was just as good. Sadly, the earl gray wasn't in season. The flavors mix together so well! I don't like ice cream that is too sweet, which is why I tend to go for fruity flavors, but Bi-Rite gets the taste right. I really enjoyed Bi-Rite! The cookies and creme looked delicious too. Would have tried, but didn't have the foresight. OMG they take credit card? JACKPOT. Bill Tip: Bring a lot of friends, and time waiting in line will fly by. Bill Tip #2: If you don't wanna wait in line, grab a pint at the nearby market or at the front of the line.

Maybe the best ice cream shop in all the world! I almost feel bad calling it ice cream, like it's an insult, because of how other worldly this place really is and how unlike any other ice cream place it is. Was visiting from out of town in August and heard all the wonderful things people were saying. "You have to come here!" They were right. Your San Francisco experience is not complete unless you come to Bi-Rite. Salted caramel was ridiculous. Not enough words to describe how insanely delicious it was. It was everything an ice cream should be. The line when we rolled up was literally out the door, almost in another block entirely. Man I wish this place was in Orange County. I get sad thinking about how far it is. Can't wait to come back!

I couldn't decide whether or not to review this place for just its ice cream / products, or to review it for the experience, which normally apparently entails standing in a line up to an hour, closely surrounded by hungry and over-heated hipsters.  I'm surprised this place doesn't smell more like BO. I was fortunate in not having to suffer through a line. I guess that's what we get for going right after noon after a 10am brunch. What can I say, having east coast visitors is like getting a large cup of coffee dumped on your face in the morning. Ice cream was great. but honestly, when was the last time someone threw away ice cream because they didn't like it? ice cream is ALWAYS great. Sure this place is better than most, but it's not like the flavors of the ice cream is still lingering in my mouth after 2 weeks or anything. You'd think by the way people rate this place, the ice cream empowered human flight or something. in conclusion: go when convenient (i realize convenience is defined differently by everyone). I have a suspicion that I may regret the experience if I have to stand in the hot sun with a mediocre conversationalist, surrounded by hipsters who stop by after running around with their dog in dolores park.

OMG! How have I not written a review for Bi-Rite yet?! I absolutely LOVE the ice cream here. There are so many great, unique flavors that you really can't choose a wrong one. Salted Caramel is definitely my favorite. It is a perfect balance of salty and sweet flavors.The Honey Lavender is another great, light and fresh flavor.  Ricanelas = Cinnamon + Snickerdoodle bits = YUM! Having so many interesting options makes it difficult to choose a flavor but they let you sample a bunch to help you choose! :D They also have suggested combinations of flavors, sundaes, ice cream sandwiches, popsicles, and more yummy ice cream creations. Beware of a long line! Two times I came here and the line was super long. It doesn't matter what time it is or how cold it is.. it's somehow always crowded! BUT it is always worth it! Bi-Rite is a must-try in SF for any ice cream lover :)

Tried the Ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles), Mint Chocolate Chip and Chocolate.   No wait, and no mess as the ice cream was so good, I don't think it had time to melt.   Oh yeah, I believe the hype!  And the service is super friendly.

Walked a few blocks to get to Bi-Rite, but it was so worth it!! The line wasn't too bad at all on a weekday around 8pm. I tasted 94134254 flavors, but settled on the ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles) in a sugar cone. It was really rich and creamy. The flavors are so unique here -- I really want to try the balsamic strawberry, but it's seasonal! Wish I got a sundae, but guess it's on my list of to-try flavors next time I'm back. :)

I remember always being jealous when I read Bi-Rite reviews.  It seemed like all my friends went there already. Guess where was my first stop @ San Francisco? Yep, you guess right!! Parking in San Francisco was horrible.  I saw so many people licking their Bi-Rite on the way to the store since I parked blocks away. Good thing the line was short and it moved fairly quick.  Free samples using real spoon..none of those cheap plastic spoons/sticks.   $3.50 got me single (honey lavender and earl grey) home-made ice cream.  Weird how they call is single since it is basically 2 scoops.  Dang..it was cheaper than my parking.  I also tried chocolate (very good) and orange cardamon (not bad but not my favorite).  Glutten free cookie is also available there. Check out Bi-Rite market if you are around the area.  The market also has Bi-Rite pre-packaged ice cream. 4 stars!! Bi-Rite Creamery is yummylicious!!

Was entertaining an out-of-town guest who suggested we visit Bi-Rite. Apparently my friend knows more about SF than I do. Oh well, live and learn. As I said in my review for Smittens, I spent three summers working at a Baskin Robbins so I have a really low tolerance for generic or boring flavors now. But it also means I get really excited when I discover new flavors that are delicious. I only got the salted caramel and roasted banana this time around, but I have to say they were pretty good. Salted caramel isn't super unique, but I've never had it before and didn't think it was too bad. Never heard of ice cream being roasted banana flavor before, though, and I really liked it. Absolutely delicious. When I go back a second time, the rational side of my brain will tell me to try a new flavor but the side of my brain that is tapped into my raw primordial need for instant gratification will compel me to choose roasted banana again as one of my flavors. Oh well, live and let live.

Am I biased? Scoops and Sweet Rose Creamery in LA are more my style. Not so sweet and creamier! I had the malted vanilla and it was so overly sugary that it made my teeth and throat hurt. The Earl Grey is definitely the best flavor there!

I hear this named tossed around a lot, and before you read my review, you should note, that I don't particularly enjoy sweets that much, and my tolerance for creamy stuff is extremely low. Now that we've gotten that out of the way, on to the review. I've stopped by this place before, and there is usually a line out the door. It's popular, but it's also a really small place. You only need about 4 people in line for it to be out the door. The decor is really cute, and they have little signs and stuff that are nice. When you get up to the front, you'll see the pricing (kid's scoop for 2.50), and you'll see all the flavours in front of you. You can ask for samples in which they give you a decently sized bite sized scoop on a metal spoon to munch on; no, their sample spoons are not those tiny spoons from baskin robins, they're your regular dining room spoons! They have many interesting and unique flavours, from orange carbomb, to early grey, to honey lavender. I picked the last one on a sugar cone. My friend got the early grey. Both were ridiculously creamy... wait, we came to a creamery. I felt my ice cream was overly sweet and the flavours were too pronounced. Floral flavours are best when they have a subtle flavour that creep up and support other flavours. Almost in a way, where you have to think, what is that flavour sneaking around on my tongue? Ahhhh, its (insert flower name here). The service was very neutral. It wasn't outstanding. I didn't a greet with a smile, there was no conversation, or trying to help me decide which flavour to pick. It was very neutral in that, the server was there to just scoop my ice cream and take my money. Thus the vibes of this place only come from the decor, and nothing else. Prices are very whatever. 2.50 for a kids scoop I guess isn't as marked up as it could be due to the popularity, but it should really be closer to 1.50-2. I can't tell if this place or coldstone has creamier ice cream. Parking isn't easy to find either. It's a cozy place, and if you love creamy ice cream, they have a lot of wonderful flavours to try. If you can appreciate ice cream but don't love it, you may want to try this place. If you're not a big fan of ice cream, but can handle a bit, I'd still avoid this place. Thanks, but no thanks. 2 stars (1 for the decor, and one for the variety of ice cream flavours)

I'm a sucker for ice cream and delicious things. Bi-Rite is good. It's not as mind blowing as it is hyped up to be. The employees are hipsteresque -- some offer smiles, and others are too cool for that; some offer samples, and others are too cool for that; some scoop you decent sized scoops, and others are too cool for that. I came here and waited in line despite the fact that it was a cold day at Dolores. I tried the Salted Caramel and Mint Chip. The salted caramel was awesome, the mint chip...was ok. I'd definitely choose Thrifty's Mint Chip over this. I'm just going to say it...Mitchell's is way better than this place. Buuut, good ice cream is good ice cream...so I ain't hatin'

This place beats out humphrey slocombe. If you don't know what to get, try the EARL GREY or the HONEY LAVENDAR. Be prepared to wait in line outside during warm days. They usually have three employees taking orders behind the counter though, so the line moves quickly. You can taste at the counter, but don't abuse the privilege (because I might be in line behind you trying to get ice cream too). Prices are not cheap, and a pint can run you a ridiculous 15 or 18 dollars. After getting your ice cream, walk across the street to Dolores Park and find a patch of grass to enjoy it! This and Ici in Berkeley are the two best ice cream shops in the Bay Area.

Their salted caramel ice cream is by far, the best ice cream I've ever had in my life. If there's one thing I do not like about this place, it's the long-a** line. But you can't blame them for making ice cream so good that it's loved by so many. It was my first time here last Saturday and we waited in line for an hour! Good thing the weather was nice outside (yup, the line went from inside the store all the way to the corner of the street. Crazy, huh?) I ordered 3 flavors and so did my husband. We both had salted caramel, and my other two flavors were Earl Grey and Honey Lavender. My husband had sorbet and coffee toffee (also very delish!) Now that spring/summer is coming, I'm gonna be seen here more often, for sure!

The best ice cream I've had in San Francisco.  Been here a couple times before and every time I get one of their interesting flavors and have always been very pleased.  This time I decided to go old school and get the chocolate soft serve.  It was just as great as the regular ice cream - it reminded me of being a kid again. Yeah, the line can be bad in the evenings.  Big fat hairy deal.  I've been to a lot of places with no line, and guess what, the product usually sucks.

It is the perfect treat to end your day at Dolores Park. I picked up the soft-serve through the express window and you don't have to worry about the lines or wait and get your guilty pleasure to go! Bi-Rite is a staple and you have to check it out whether you're in the area or not! Salty caramel plus chocolate swirl soft-serve ice cream cone. Enough said.

My favorite ice cream place in San Francisco! Ricanelas is delicious! The salted caramel and brown sugar ice creams are also really great. The Brownie Sundae isn't that great as far as brownie sundae's go.  The ice cream is better on its own. Perhaps some of their unique sundaes are better. I also tried a snickerdoodle/ricanelas ice cream sandwich once.  As much as I love their ricanelas ice cream, I didn't really enjoy this.  The ricanelas in the sandwich just isn't the same.  I believe that it was also much harder since they are pre-made and kept in the freezer.  Luckily, I didn't have to wait in line for it. It is located in a great place with lots of stuff around, but that just makes parking impossible.  In addition, the line can get really long since it is popular.  These are the worst aspects of Bi-Rite(but not bad enough to take away my 5 stars or title as 'Personal Favorite Ice Cream in San Franicisco).

To celebrate my wife's birthday yesterday, we bought 1 quart of Salted Caramel and 4 pints of other things. The cooler that comes up to the city with us (we live about 40 minutes away) and the freezer that lives in our garage are for storing ice cream from here (this is only a very slight exaggeration - the other half of the freezer is for country loaves from Tartine). It's so good. We're pretty good about not waiting in the lines. Over the summer we had a friend in town so we bought a pint and split it three ways and felt really good about ourselves.

Superb, intensely flavored ice cream that reminds me of frozen custard because it is so creamy. They do serve wooden spoons when you order your scoop in a dish, not my favorite way to eat ice cream because I can taste the wood. I have seen other folks with plastic spoons so they must have them...perhaps you need a secret word to snag one! My favorite combo to date is roasted banana + salted caramel!

The wait in line was 20 minutes at 2:00 on a Saturday afternoon.  Was it worth it?  Hipster tech geeks and other self-absorbed Mission District transplants were talking about...whatever the crap they talk about and there was a big blob of ice cream on the sidewalk that people (not me) were stepping on. But...it was still worth the wait.  A double scoop cone of vanilla toffee (or something like that) will hit the spot for $5. New fan here.

I recommend going on a rainy, freezing, windy weekday - not your typical ice cream weather, but best way to avoid line. However, some find the "line culture" to be enjoyable too - everybody moaning about how long the queue is, but highly anticipating the reward. Mint chip is really good, and the prices aren't bad. Like to bring visitors here, but don't go out of my way to get here. Recommend for ice cream lovers and tourists alike!

I used to only like chocolate chip cookies...that is until my roommate brought a box of raw snickerdoodle cookies home and put it in our freezer. They tasted so good raw, I ate most of the box. Now my roommate won't bring raw cookies home because I'll eat them within a week. Eating ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles) is the closest thing that brings me back to my tasty trips to the freezer. Quick tip: the honey lavender tastes like a yoga studio.

WOW is the line long for this place! Plus I went on a sunday afternoon when the weather seemed almost too good to be true during this cold winter season. However, even though the line seemed to go on for days, it actually moved relatively fast. The workers seem so hectic climbing over each other as people ask to sample all the flavors but you can tell they are working as fast as they can. SAMPLES ARE SERVED ON A METAL SPOON! say whatt?! I've never been to a place where they used normal spoons, i was expecting those cheap kiddie ones that most places use but these sample servings they give are legit full bite size ones...soo...I happily ask to sample probably 6 different flavors haha. I ended up getting a triple scoop [~$7] of salted caramel, malted vanilla, and coffee toffee. AMAZING! whatever one flavor lacked, another would make up for it so i definitely recommend combining different flavors together! they even have a huge list of sundaes that do the same. the coffee toffee has giant pieces of caramelized toffee that my friend and i were fighting over the whole time. salted caramel was super sweet, so it balanced nicely with the lighter malted vanilla. If you want a shorter line, they have a separate section for their soft serve and bakery items [cupcakes, danishes, what not] but i definitely think the wait was worth the ice cream. They also sell ice cream sandwiches [$4.50 each] and customized ice cream birthday cakes :) I'm definitely going back to buy the giant tub size portions of each flavor for those days at home when we all need a little pick me up.

What to say that hasn't already been written 5,000 times over?! Today was my first trip to Bi-Rite and I can confidently say I'll definitely fill out my punch card before we leave town - this is some of the BEST ice cream I have ever had! I love ice cream in any and all forms, but it's all the more exciting to visit places that really care about the craft and quality of the product. Bi-Rite sources local and seasonal ingredients, makes the ice cream in small batches to ensure taste, and never use artificial flavors or preservatives. You can definitely taste the difference!     After trying almost all the flavors (a super plus for their customer service!), I settled on salted caramel, roasted banana and dark chocolate. The portions aren't that big, but this place truly embodies quality over quantity: the flavors are UNBELIEVABLE, and the ice cream itself is so thick and rich that you don't need a crazy big scoop. I savored every last bite! Along with their extensive flavor list, Bi-Rite also has a great sundae menu (honey lavender ice cream with homemade dark chocolate fudge, blood orange olive oil and sea salt, anyone?). Definitely going back to try one (or let's be honest - all) of them! Have to use that punch card, after all!

Bi-Rite has amazingly flavorful ice cream!  They create delicious classics like vanilla and chocolate while putting out unique twists like malted vanilla and Meyer lemon.  The quality of this ice cream store is on par with stores that have experienced pastry chefs like Ici's in Berkeley.   Unfortunately, the line can get quite long here and the staff do nothing to alleviate this nuisance (hence 4 stars instead of 5).

This is one of my favorite ice creams. I always come here to get the salted caramel or if I'm feeling extra hungry I'll get a big sundae with hot fudge! The fudge is super thick and delicious, none of that runny fake stuff other parlors serve. I go here when I want really good gourmet ice cream. An ice cream where you dont need to pile on hot fudge or cookies to make it taste better. You can just order a scoop and it's simply delicious all on its own. The long lines are worth the wait, except for extremely cold days. I just use my iphone to play games or bring a kindle to read. haha.

The first time I attempted to find this place, I got lost and walked into the Bi-Rite market.  I was so disappointed at first  because I thought I wouldn't be able to try the ice cream here until I discovered the creamery was across the street.  There's a soft serve counter right next to it too, so don't get confused like I did.   When I went into the creamery, it was a lot smaller than I had expected.  I didn't see all of the fancy ice creams that I had imagined.  However, I was happy with the unique creations that I did see, such as Honey Lavender.  They let you try the ice cream before you decide, which is always nice.  But it gets hectic in there, so it feels a little tense because you have to move out of the way and make quick decisions which aren't always easy to do when you have to decide on eating a unique flavor you've never heard of before.  They do have regular items though like cookies and creme and vanilla (from what I remember!). I really enjoyed my ice cream and I want to return to try some of the other flavors, but this time I want to be more prepared by finding flavors online if possible!  I hate feeling rushed.

I've been waiting ages to try Bi-Rite Creamery and finally, finally had the chance last week when I visited SF! It did NOT disappoint. I tried several samples and ended up sharing a double scoop of three flavors: brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl, ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodle), and salted caramel. They were ALL sweet, delicious, and creamy. The flavors complemented one another well, and I was one happy camper! I also liked the earl grey and the honey lavender, which my other friend ordered. Also, surprisingly, there was no long line! Maybe because it was a freezing winter day.. but hey, I will eat ice cream any day!

The boyfriend and I decided to visit the city the day before classes started and as an ice cream stickler, I couldn't help but beg him to come with me to Bi-Rite after hearing rave reviews both from my friends and by bloggers! I went on Sunday before MLK day around 2 o'clock and boy was it busy! The line wrapped around the corner and they conveniently had the sidewalk sectioned off for the line to make way for sidewalk traffic. Judging by the line, I really thought that we would be waiting up to 35 minutes until we could order but what do you know! The line felt and went by like it was only 15 minutes long, which is not bad considering that it was pretty warm that day. Since I had already had early grey and honey lavender at ICI in Berkeley, I decided to be a little more "adventurous" with my ice cream choice and went with malted vanilla (SO GOOD-- that peanut brittle and milk chocolate is just another star itself) and brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl. Had I not known about the calorie count (thanks to the boyfriend), I would eat two tubs of both of these flavors in one night. The boyfriend decided that he wanted toasted coconut-- unfortunately due to the loud crowd, our server heard "roasted banana" and so he got a scoop of that instead, which was still pretty good albeit being the wrong order. Definitely coming back again and bringing more people to try all the flavors!

While standing in line here for the first time a few years ago with my friend and inductor I thought 'how good could this ice cream possibly be to have a such a long line?'  I'd tried Ben & Jerry's, Häagen-Dazs, and Cold Stone Creamery and those were the best ice creams I've had.  How could this be better? Aaand after my first few licks of salted caramel, roasted banana, and balsamic strawberry I was jaw-dropped and wide-eyed - very pleasantly and deliciously surprised.  WOW.  How could ice cream taste so good?  Apparently I haven't been eating REAL ice cream until now.  So milky, rich, thick, creamy, and bursting with flavor.  This ice cream is in a whole league of its own. After the first taste I got it.  I got why there's a long wait and line wrapped around the corner even in the sweltering heat and beating sun.  And I got why I would probably drive all the way to SF, just for ice cream.  D*mn, it's gee-double-oh-dee-good! I hear there are at least a couple other delicious premium ice cream shops in SF.  I've yet to try and compare those with Bi-Rite's.  Until then, this is by far the best ice cream I've ever had.

I LOVEE ice cream. So I am just trying to help out the ice-cream lovers out there. My first time trying bi-rite was about 2 years ago. I do like their unique selection of flavors, but it was TOO unique to the point where it tasted funky in my mouth. I like my ice cream flavors subtle, simple, but still surprising. I tried their balsamic strawberry and salted caramel (different days) and felt that the flavors were too strong and not very complementary. I never went back until just recently. The weather in SF has been super nice lately so that made me crave some ice cream. Because I was in the neighborhood, I decided to stop by again. Coffee & Toffee: Coffee/expresso is my favorite ice cream flavor. If that is you too, then you will not be disappointed. The toffee adds a bit more sweetness and crunch to the ice cream. If you're not into extra texture in your ice cream, then maybe forget about this one. Earl Grey: YUMMYY. Subtle flavor, which I enjoy. I bought myself a pint because of how delicious this flavor is. If you're a fan of tea, or just a fan of light flavors you might like this. Overall, I think I'll find myself coming back more often. Their long lines are never a big issue for me. Even with a line wrapped around the sidewalk, it only takes about 15 minutes before you reach to the front of the store. Service is great. They are not stingy with their sample sizes like many other ice cream parlors. You'll be seeing more of me bi-rite.

I reread my review from 3 years ago and I'm like...WTF was I thinking? Not sure if I fell into the overhypedness or if my tastes refined...or their quality declined....but Bi-Rite is definitely not on my list of go-to ice cream shops. Their ice cream is not bad, it's good, really....but it's really not as special or mind-blowing as it seems (my initial review and I are quite guilty about this) I do, however, love their honey lavender. I also enjoy the chocolate soft serve. These are the only things I get whenever I go these days (when friends want to go....) Bottom line...overhyped.

I love this place. On a warm day there are few things better than picking up a cone at Bi-Rite after hanging out in Dolores Park. There's not much seating inside, but who cares? It's warm, right? You want to be outside enjoying your ice cream, which is delicious. The ice cream is made by them with real ingredients (milk, sugar, etc). There's no high fructose corn syrup or anything of that nature. They even have a vegan option or two, which are quite good.

I am so glad they sell their ice cream in pints. That way, I can dig into my freezer and pig out whenever I crave Bi-Rite - which is pretty often! Salted caramel, roasted banana, pumpkin ice cream, earl gray...creamy, flavorful, fresh-tasting ice cream. What more can you want?? Line can get long, but moves relatively fast. Easy-ish parking nearby is always a plus in San Francisco!

I am an ice cream snob and I highly recommended Bi-Rite. Bi-Rite does ice cream well.  Honey Lavender and Ginger is a must.   Downside - be prepared for a RIDICULOUS line.  Although it does pass quickly.  I suggest skipping ahead and buying a pint, which is only, like, $2 more than a single serving.

Living in the SF Bay Area with its perpetually temperate days of 50-60s year-round, you wouldn't imagine that this place would have such a strong following. But after passing this joint in the middle of December, one would start to notice how a group 20+ people all wearing winter coats could have the patience to stand in a line that wraps around the block. Then I wonder, what flavor of crack is in what they're selling? In my book, ice cream is considered a major food group. Eventually, my curiosity, major obsession with ice cream and the thousands of Yelp reviews is what finally got me to check this place out. Bi-Rite Creamery is not just your run-of-the-mill Dreyers' or Ben N' Jerry's mass-produced ice cream from your chain supermarket. They have unique flavors and here are some of my faves: Mexican Chocolate, Ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles), Salted Caramel and White Chocolate Raspberry (my all time #1 choice). Lines form quickly at night (6-8pm) and when in line, remember to keep voices down coz there are residents who live in the apartments above. Inside includes a small area to sit and even includes a restroom. They have a pint and quarts-sized to-go containers in a freezer for quick pick ups. Prices range from $6/pint to almost $10/quart. Street parking is nearly impossible during peak hours so 1) take public trans or 2) have a friend drop you off and pick you up after getting the goods. They have a frequent customer card and for every 10 visits, you get a free scoop of ice cream! Hands down, the best ice cream in the city. Not even the ubiquitous Ghirardelli with its hoards of tourists can rival this place! Thumbs up for a 60-year SF history and all the ice cream still being made on site!

Not really into sweets into particular but I'm a big fan of sorbets. Came here twice, the first time I got the grapefruit sorbet and the second time I was able to try the orange sorbet. I'm not sure what what they do to make their sorbets but they were by far sublime. The consistency is just perfect and definitely has a distinction from their ice cream, which by virtue of being a creamery is superb. The people scooping the ice cream were pretty nice and if I did have to get the ice cream I would definitely try the roasted coconut, banana, or the ricanelas. I've tried the salted caramel it was good as well. Also being close to Dolores Park is a huge plus as well. I've been here on a Friday night and it wasn't very crowded but I did experience a long line when I came on a Saturday afternoon.

By far some of the best ice cream I have ever tasted. At first I couldn't believe this place had a line that looked more like you were trying to get into a night club. The only thing that was missing was a bouncer checking for ids. I told myself this better be good or I would let it be known to the masses of my dislikes. Well this was better than good and don't regret a second I waited in line for this delicious treat.

Great service, went in this afternoon for once I was in the park on a Monday and there was no line (I won't wait in that ridiculous line for anything.) So this was my first BiRite Creamery experience. I told the super hunk behind the counter I had no idea what I wanted so he just kept handing me spoonfuls of different flavors. They were a little (or a lot) too sweet for me, but it is ice cream. By the time I chose my flavor, I already felt like I had had my share of ice cream. The Honey Lavender was less sweet and super yum.  I wish I had an excuse to hang out in there longer and chat with the staff, but the place is small and I had to mosey on outside to enjoy my treat on the benches outside. I'll be back, but I still won't wait in a line that wraps around the building. Thanks BiRite

Per Fifty Shades of Grey, vanilla is boring. Upon visiting Bi-Rite, I was introduced to a whole different world of ice cream. Flavors that I have had never heard of before. Two notable flavors include salted caramel and strawberry balsamic. Intrigued by the ingredients, I had to try them. Although I was skeptical of the taste as I am not a fan of caramel nor balsamic vinegar, I was feeling adventurous and did not want to be a bore. Additionally, I did not want to miss out on something amazing. Upon the taste test, I was hooked. The salted caramel ice cream is perfectly sweet and creamy. The sea salt made the caramel less sweet, which I appreciated. I only dislike caramel flavored items because it is too sweet and buttery-tasting for my liking. The strawberry balsamic ice cream is my favorite and it reminded me of a Pocky stick. The balsamic vinegar brought out the sweetness of the strawberry, and did not make it bitter tasting whatsoever. It is like strawberry ice cream, but better. Bi-Rite has won me over! They use flavors that I am not so fond of and made them all kinds of amazing. I guess I am a sucker for surprises.

Meh. For the hype this place gets, I wasn't impressed. We circled a few times around the block before snagging a parking space nearby. Got the salted caramel ice cream and we were really underwhelmed. The ice cream was not rich and creamy, but was more on par with store bought ice cream. Rather than the buttery caramel taste I love, this was weird and hard to describe...it was almost acidic with a funky aftertaste. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here.

First thing, wow. This place has over five thousand reviews, plus a ton of lines every time I pass by or come here. Since the five thousand reviews basically explains everything, I just wanna tell everyone to make sure to get the Honey Lavender at this place, you can not miss it. It is a silky and flowery dream in a form of an ice cream. After having this ice cream, you sure will want a cow that squeeze out honey lavender ice cream.

After dinner at Big Lantern w/ my group of 14, we made our way to this creamery, only by recommendation. We didn't know about the hype, or how good this place actually was. I got the Honey Lavender, what I normally get at my local Molly Moon's (Seattleite). This creamery itself was hipster looking, and I like that type of shit. Simple flavors, good people, amazing ice cream, and it was a cool place to be. How much better does it get?

Couldn't leave my Bay Area trip without coming to Bi-Rite!! I ended up getting a double scoop with Salted Caramel and Lavender Vanilla just because those are the two most popular. Salted Caramel -- only okay. Usually, I love anything with salt and caramel but it could of had more flavor. I much rather prefer the Burnt Caramel flavor over at Ici's in Berkeley. Honey Lavender -- tasted very interesting. It was light and floral, in a good way. I enjoyed it for the unique taste, not being able to order it anywhere near home. The texture and consistency of their ice cream is great and smooth. Next time I come here, I am definitely going to order Earl Grey!!!

As though Bi-Rite needs another 5-star review...the Yelp rating of 4.5 stars based on 5,223 people before me speaks for itself! I must have been lucky that the line was only about 10 people long when I arrived. It was just the right amount of time to figure out which flavors I wanted to taste! I sampled the brown sugar, and decided to go with this, along with the popular salted caramel, in a cone. The ice cream is thick and creamy, just as it should be, and the flavors are so... flavorful! The salted caramel kind of overpowered the brown sugar flavor because it was much more rich in flavor, but individually they were both excellent. As Liz W. mentioned, this place is similar to Ici in Berkeley-- they make their ice cream right there, and they have very interesting and unique flavors. I do wish their cones had chocolate tips like the ones at Ici! But overall, I preferred the thick, creamy texture of the ice cream at Bi-Rite a little more than Ici. I can't wait to come back to try more flavors!

so you want to know who the love of my life is?  here is where i divulge... it's an ice cream.  not just any ice cream, but one on which i have my eyes set on from afar, in the city where i left my heart.  Bi-Rite Creamery has stolen my palate's love for ice cream and as much as i've tried - there is no letting go.  i've searched high and low... no cali, so cali - and time and again i run back to Bi-Rite, my true love. what is it that keeps drawing me back?  it's the SALTED CARAMEL.  others have tried to re-create it or simply create their own version, but no one else gives me a TURN ON as the burnt BITE that this one does.  my other little lovers include the sultry HONEY LAVENDER... followed closely by the robust COFFEE TOFFEE, luscious  BROWN SUGAR WITH GINGER CARAMEL SWIRL and decadent COCONUT CHOCOLATE (vegan).  don't forget about their popsicles and cookies - the one i always go to is the toffee chip. the one place i have yet to explore...  and my mind definitely has wandered there, are those jarred syrups...  caramel and chocolate sauces.  so tempting.  one of these days i'll relentlessly give in.  great thing is i can take them back with me to lala land and keep the steam going a bit longer... till the next visit ;) so there you go.  now you know where to find my booty when i'm rendezvousing in the bay area.

Salted Caramel ice cream is what I line up for. It does not matter when I swing by. There's always a long snake of a line in the evening. And one that moves pretty fast! Hats off to their super-efficient staff. My diabetic friend, who is also a big foodie, loves salted caramel but warns me that it has loads of sugar. Like anything in life, the key is moderation. So, I go once every couple weeks or so to get my fix. It's a really nice treat after a ho-hum day.   The tables and chairs are small. The chairs are comfortable enough to sit and finish your ice cream before it starts to melt. Anything longer than 15 to 20 minutes, your butt will start to hurt. It's really close to many other cool restaurants in the Mission. Right beside the hipster place, Namu Gaji, and across the Dolores Park Cafe. When the line is too long or the weather is just too damn cold to be waiting outside, I go across the street and get a pint of salted caramel from the Bi-Rite Market. More bang for your buck if you have the patience to wait until you get home before taking your first lick. Happy slurping.

Generally, to me, ice cream is ice cream. I can tell when it's good (creamy and rich) and when it's bad (icy and not flavorful), but otherwise I'm honestly not too picky. Mostly I go to ice cream shops just to order interesting flavors that you can't get at the supermarket. I was really excited to try Bi-Rite's earl grey ice cream, but they didn't have it in yet :( (for other Earl Grey lovers, one of the workers told me that it should be arriving in a few days) so I ended up getting Roasted Banana and Coffee Toffee. Both were good and not sickeningly sweet; I really don't know what else to say about ice cream, haha. I love that they use metal spoons for samples though! And thanks to the workers for patiently putting up with my excessive sampling 0:)

This is a nice affordable ice parlor right across from a park which is really nice. This has got to be some of the best ice cream around. I really enjoyed the ice cream served here and the quantity you get is quite good for the price. I went to grab some ice cream and headed to the park to enjoy a day in SF that was pleasantly nice and sunny. It's a bit small but has some old fashion feel to it not like a true old fashion parlor but still nice enough.

After trying here 5 more times, I now see why people are crazy on Bi-Rite.  It's the best in SF.  That's all!  I felt the flavoring was artificial because it was very strong.  Later I found out that It is the only kind of ice cream available that natural flavors taste like artificial ones because Bi-Rite uses ample ingredients to make perfect ice cream.  This is the culinary innovation for ice cream.  I wish it was distributed to different specialty shops in the entire Bay Area.

After hearing the endless hullabaloo about how great this place is we decided we needed to make a trek out to the city to try it...Well we never did. But when my friend's sister wanted ice cream before she left to live in Egypt - we wanted to make it special and only the best would do. So we brought coolers and ice  and made the trek out on a Saturday afternoon. There was some awful hipster fair in the middle of the street with people playing their guitars in their skinny pants. Not a good start. But we waited in line that went around the corner for ice cream. The line actually moved quickly and within 20'ish minutes we went inside to order. The selections were a bit odd at first. Chocolate with olive oil? Lavender? But I know the reputation and went with some classics. Salted caramel with whipped cream and fudge w nuts...it was AMAZING! Despite the wave of people with their odd clothes and stupid thick rimmed sunglasses and men in capri pants - nothing could ruin the sanctity of that bowl of ice cream. If it weren't for the line and my cholesterol, I would have gotten back in line for another one. If I find myself in the area again, I wouldn't hesitate to go back. Its also spectacularly cheap for what you get.

Always a fan, worth the wait - line goes quick anyway so give it 10-15 and you're good to go. Honey Lavender never disappoints. I try the seasonal flavors every time I visit. I had Honey Lavender mixed with Earl Grey during my last visit and it was a good combination of somewhat similar flavors. Highly recommend both, separate or not.

ice cream is whatever to me. for example, when I eat a drumstick cone, I eat all the chocolate and give the vanilla scoop to my mom, so I can savor the waffle cone/chocolate combination. I get tired of ice cream too fast. Not here. Salted caramel is amazing. I see reviewers saying they've had better... but its so delicious I don't think I wanna know what's better. Came back twice in one week on my lunch break. Should have never tried it I'm quite addicted. I think I'll go after I get off work later. Hmmmm.

Came here on a chilly Sunday night where there was fortunately less than 10 people in line. Apparently I lucked out, although I wish to apologize to all those behind me because it was my first trip to Bi-Rite and I wanted to sample anything and everything for the purposes of this review. The line is only as slow as the decision-making of the people in it, as the workers here are swift and efficient.   I think had I not tried Molly Moon's Salted Caramel, Bi-Rite's would have impressed me.  But as it stands, there was something about it that simply wasn't a home-run for me.  It wasn't particularly salty or caramel-ly, to me.  More like...burnt peanut brittle?  Don't get me wrong, it was still good...just not what I had hoped/expected.  Basically, MM has ruined all salted caramel ice cream for me. The honey lavender, on the other hand, was the best I've had yet, very delicate and sweet.  Unfortunately, it just so happens to be a flavor where I can't imagine eating an entire bowlful.  After that, I tried a handful of other flavors...but not a single one left an impression on me.  So unimpressive, in fact, that I can't even remember which flavors they were and it's only been a week!  So, running out of options fast, I went for my safety net: mint chip. My order was combined with my boyfriend's malted vanilla into a two-scoop small.  The mint chip was good but it didn't blow my mind.  The malted vanilla was more impressive, but between the two, I'd probably still choose mint chip again due to personal preference. Anyway, I think I would have liked Bi-Rite a lot more if the ice cream was creamier (à la Ici in Berkeley).  It was nice to try since I was in the area anyway, though I doubt I'd make the trek to the Mission solely to have Bi-Rite.  I don't know if it's me or if I just need to find "the" flavor.  But as of this review, my search for the best ice cream in the Bay continues...

Tried a salted caramel scoop with the coffee ice cream. delicious. This ice cream packs a mouthful! There is no need to put toppings on this ice cream because it has more flavor than any ice cream ive ever tried! The staff was amazing!! When I told them it was my first time here, they gave me samples like no tomorrow. They were super outgoing and made the place even more enjoyable.

yeah its a cool place to be if your a hipster. They do served some unique flavor and the taste is high quality IMPORTANT POINTS: 1. dont get the salted caramel. its not that good and there are better tasting flavors to offer. 2. try the flower/ plant flavors for the experience 3. If your a homophobe, might want to stay away from this place. 4. parking is a BIT%& better be good at parallel parking. 5. really friendly staff and a gay dude winked at me. not sure if i should feel flattered or insulted...

BEST COOKIES & CREME ice cream I've ever had! My boyfriend had the roasted banana, but I wasn't a fan at all. It did however, taste a bit like a bananas foster if it had caramel on top. I sampled the salted caramel, which is their #1, but didn't care for it at all. For two single scoops in sugar cones, it was $5 exactly. Parking is difficult so either get their early, or be prepared to walk. The line is long, but usually goes quickly. About a 10-15 minute wait at the end of the line.

Came here on a cold rainy winter day, and I was NOT the only one in line for ice cream! We tried the Lavender and Salted Caramel flavors. Both selections were packed with flavor compared to any other ice cream I've tried. The Lavender tasted like I was in a field of blossomed lavender flowers...had a floral, and smooth taste. The salted caramel had more of a dark caramel taste to it. I wish it had more of a lighter caramel taste with a little more salt. But still delicious!

Any place whose "single scoop" is actually 2 scoops is a freaking winner in my book. Don't be intimidated by the line - it goes quickly. My fave is the honey lavender, followed by a tie between the chocolate and salted caramel. Is it just me or are we not impressed by plain ole "chocolate" anymore? It has to be something fancy like hazelnut turtle praline toffee crunch. Anyway, the chocolate here is very rich and chocolatey. I wasn't a fan of the earl grey which really surprised me because I usually like earl grey errythang.

Yes it's some of the best ice cream you'll ever have, but it's a little over the top that people are waiting 20 people deep on a cold foggy night for a cone.  Just go in the door and grab a pint or quart instead and you'll be on your way eating ice cream in no time.

Even though there's usually a line, the staff are super friendly and happy to offer every flavor to this indecisive yelper. Ah yes, and for those indecisive types, you can put two flavors in a small. Win!

I have a crazy sweet tooth, and Bi-Rite calms it down! Their ice cream is so on point and delicious; it makes a crappy day so much better. I got their malted vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate pieces, and it brought a smile to my face. Their salted caramel is freaking on point, though. I'm pretty sure that's my go-to flavor every time I go there now. Put those two scoops on a sugar cone and your life will become so much better. (':

I laugh when I think about this place because the friend who took me really hyped it up good and then proceeded to kind of bash on it (mostly because of the incredibly long lines). But who can deny 4.5 stars on 5,000+ reviews? I still went in with pretty mixed/confused expectations, but I ended up thinking it was really great. (I also had the added benefit of a less than 10 minute wait since it was the dead of winter.) I got the salted caramel and earl grey, which seem to be pretty standard first-time choices, and I was kinda blown away. I'd been looking for an ice cream place with unique, homemade flavors like Salt & Straw in Portland since coming back to the Bay Area, and I think I've found it in Bi-Rite... I'm not sure how I'll feel about stopping by here consistently when the weather starts warming up and lines start getting crazy though.

On the list of my top 5 favorite ice cream parlor.  Ice cream is not overly creamy.  The salted caramel was very good, not too sweet.  The lines can be long but moves fairly fast.  Conveniently located across the park.  Highly recommend going out of your way for a taste.

I loveeee this place! The brown sugar, olive oil, and the salted caramel flavors are the BEST. I have been looking for a salted caramel flavored ice cream with a similar taste in grocery stores such as Whole Foods, and Safeway but I have never been able to find a salted caramel that tastes as delicious and satisfying as Bi-Rite's. All the "Salted Caramel" flavored ice-creams do not taste salted at all, compared to Bi-Rite's. It's definitely a must try!

What a great way to start the new year than with a visit to Bi-Rite!  I've heard all the raving reviews about this place and now I finally had a chance to try it myself. I was intrigued by all their unique flavors, which change by the day!  I had to order their signature flavor, Salted Caramel, along with Mint Chip which is always my favorite.  The double scoop ($5) is well worth it with two big, plum-sized scoops of DELICIOUSNESS!  This had to be one of the BEST ice creams I ever had!  The texture was very rich and creamy and the ingredients all tasted very fresh and natural.  The flavors are intense and distinct.  The Salted Caramel was a little sweeter than expected but the touch of saltiness made it unique!  The Mint Chip had a very refreshing and clean minty flavor and the small pieces of chocolate provided a perfect balance!  The sugar cone was EXCELLENT!!!  It was crisp, not overly sweet, and just the perfect thickness.  I thought I was eating a thin, crispy cookie! For $5 you have the option of two big scoops or three smaller scoops, so you have a chance to try their different flavors.  You can also have a single scoop or two smaller scoops.  You have choices of not only your standard chocolate and vanilla, but also flavors such as earl grey, honey lavender, coffee toffee, ginger, roasted banana, toasted coconut, and cookies and cream.  They also offer a sorbet of a season fruit and other daily specials. You can also purchase prepacked pints and quarts of your favorite flavor! Yes, the line is long but it moves quickly as the servers are not only very efficient but also friendly!  Another plus is that Bi-Rite is located right next to Dolores Park, so you can always enjoy your treat at the park. Mmmm!  I'm ready for another scoop!!!

Let me first say that i do not work here.  This is my thought about Bi-Rite Creamery. Try the soft serve window.   the two flavors change daily-  their popular and seasonal flavors.   They offer all of the same fun toppings like molten chocolate or caramel, cookies, sprinkles.  also if you want a pint or quart of the rest of their flavors , get one here in a snap.   you can also pick up some bakery treats, fresh fruit popcicles and other random sweets here too. Really though, Their HOT CHOCOLATE is thee best on the block.  If anything, this treat is what i would like anyone reading this review to take away and give a try. get one of their biscottis and use it to scoop up the fresh strauss whip cream and dip into the valhrohna (i think) chocolate. thanks for reading!

There are times when Yelp overrates things, and there are times when yelp is absolutely right. This time, it was absolutely right. There have been so many publications that have written about this place, but I really can't stress enough how this was the best ice cream I have ever had in my life.(not comparable to gelato though). There's something about ice cream that just makes a person think of childhood and happiness. Any food that makes you happy is a good food(eaten in moderation of course) but ice cream has that special feeling that takes you back to youthful summers of bygone days. Bi-Rite does ice cream like it should. I had the salted caramel(best salted caramel I have had)+ricanelas(cinnamon+snickerdoodle chunks) and it was heavenly. I have had good ice cream elsewhere(shoutout to Molly Moon's of Seattle) but Bi-rite takes the cake. The consistency, sweetness, and just flavor of it all was perfect. Even during the middle of winter(when it was 50 degrees out in the middle of night) Bi-Rite was a great place to hit up. It's worth the hype. P.S. Kudoes to the service. Really friendly with great suggestions, also I love the real metal spoons instead of the disposable ones you usually have for tasting. Eco-friendly is where it's at.

Best ice cream in the bay area, maybe all of California since I've lived in LA for 21 years of my life and never had ice cream this good. My favorite is Ricanelas and a close second is Salted Caramel.  If you're in SF, you gotta check this place out.  And while you're on that block, check out Delfina Pizzeria if you're hungry.  Their Margherita Pizza with homemade fennel sausage is SO GOOD!

I've lost count on how many times I've been here already. My philosophy with ice cream is that there is always room for it, even during the cold weather. My favorite is Salted Caramel. The first bite is always overpowering, but once you keep eating it really grows on you. I love that hint of saltiness. The Toasted Coconut and Toffee Coffee is also amazing. I like taking my ice cream and sitting on the grass at Dolores Park. As I write this review, I'm already anticipating my next visit. When can I catch the J-line?

Bi-Rite Creamery, Humphrey Slocombe, Salt & Straw; who is the best of them all? If I had to arrange them in chronological order from most favorite to less (not least but less) favorite I'd say Bite-Rite Creamery, Salt & Straw, to Humphrey Slocombe. Sorry HS fans. Don't get me wrong, I'd have any one of them any day and any time as each has its own merits.  But here is my justification. Bi-Rite Creamery: I had the honey lavender. It was light, felt like low-fat cream. Every mouthful melts ever-so seamlessly and I wish every bite could last a little longer because the taste is that clean, once the melt is over, it's gone. That's how real ice cream should be, no waxy or gummy taste left behind. Flavor was balance, not too sweet. I sampled their salted caramel and found it way too sweet for my taste but nonetheless it's still very good ice cream made from very good ingredients. Humphrey Slocombe: I will write a separate review on this place. I give them full credits on creativity. They have some real neat flavors but in terms of the mouth-feel, it is less smooth than Bi-Rite. I felt a bit of waxy and gummy taste. Salt & Straw: This is another joint I must give them full credits for originality. Strawberry balsamic black pepper? Blue cheese pear? Need I say more? This review is about Bi-Rite so I am going to wrap up by saying, dear Anne and Kris, should you every want to expand outside of San Francisco, please consider Vancouver. We will love and worship you all the way!

Okay I decided to come back and I'm not sure why I wasn't so in love with it before - maybe the long line turned me off. Anyhow, hardly anyone's in line during the winter and I loved the Candy Cane ice cream so much (peppermint with pieces of candy cane) that I went to the store and picked up pints of it. Legit.

They let you sample EVERYTHANGGG which is great for indecisive little me. &they were patient and helpful which is a plus.(extra tip) Plenty of good options.

Holy Shit! Are you serious?! I never imagined an ice cream that would blow me out of the water! Out of the three flavors we got-- Cookies and cream, Brown Sugar, Salted Caramel-- Salted Caramel won my heart and brown sugar made me weak in the knees. Thank you, God, for giving the owners the gift of making such damn good ice cream. I dare to say the best cold treat I've everrrrrrrr ever ever had. (Good things the owners believe sharing is caring because my honey picked up their recipe book for me, which includes the, hell yes, salted caramel recipe.)

All hype.  I mean it's ice cream, I love ice cream, but it's really not as awesome as everyone thinks it is.  It's really weird that their Mexican chocolate has peanuts in it, and just tastes like regular chocolate. Mitchell's Mexican chocolate is far more supreme.  I'd wait in line for them any day.  Bi-Rite?  If I'm close and the wait isn't long and I'm to lazy to go to Mitchell's.

Salted caramel... Hmmm... Maybe it's just me or it was the batch I tried, but I would have called it salted burnt sugar instead for Bi-Rite's #1 flavor. At least we got to try a few flavors before deciding what to order! So I also tried the honey lavender which I thought was eh as well. Maybe I just needed to stick to more normal flavors? Gf tried the toasted almond. We ended up getting two sundaes: the afternoon snack and a custom one with mint chocolate chip ice cream, toasted almond ice cream, toffee bits, and a caramel sauce. The afternoon snack was mine as I love bananas and the ice cream for that one is a roasted banana ice cream. Sooo delicious! Also in it were homemade graham crackers, caramel sauce, and whipped cream which were also good, but honestly the ice cream itself was so good that I felt like I could have just ordered a pint of it by itself! Oh and gf liked her sundae a lot as well. I only got to try a bite because if I dared for more I would have lost a hand. Line itself wasn't long at all for a cool, Sunday evening that we went on, but seating was a bit hard although it's probably because I'm on crutches right now. As a non San Francisco person, I'd say this is really good stuff... even better than my beloved Swensen's (well at least because they don't have the same flavors and combinations like they do in Thailand.) I'll be back once I figure out how to ship that roasted banana ice cream back to Chicago!

"Perfect place to go when it's raining, windy, and 30 degrees out" - The locals of San Francisco OK, so they did not explicitly say that, but the line was massive. You can believe that everyday is a black friday sale at this location, without the sale, just the ravenous people with murderous intent. I would recommend anyone that is jobless, interested in a business venture and currently hanging out at Delores park to dedicate a part of their day camping in line and selling their spots. This would provide a very steady income for a small family of 10. But I digress. I don't believe I can say anything that hasn't already been said so instead I'll just list a conversation that transpired between two people excited about coming here. One who had been here before, one who had not. Person A: What's your favorite flavor? Person B: Banana Person A: Just Banana or Banana nut? Person B: What? I don't think there's multiple choices of banana Person A: Well, you gotta go with Banana nut or else you'd just have blue balls! But really, if you like banana, get banana, it's pretty good. Unlike the mass, I actually wasn't a big fan of the salted caramel but I can say my favorite was the snickerdoodle. I would also recommend that you go in the extreme cold because then you can cherish it for a longer time than you would otherwise. You go when it's cold enough and you can fit the saying you are what you eat.

Whenever I need a little heaven, I come here. Yeah, it's that damn good! Well worth the typical wait. Seriously. I think my faves are the salted caramel and the brown sugar.

I usually don't like trying ice cream shops because they all are mediocre / average to me, and taste about the same. I'm good with my Blue Bell ice cream from H-E-B while on my couch. But Bi-Rite..did me right. I don't know what it is about their ice cream, but I left feeling like it was the best ice cream I've ever had. Creamy goodness. Great flavors. I personally liked the Coffee Toffee. Salted Caramel is one of the most popular ones but I personally thought it was all right. The texture of the ice cream here though is what gets me. You know it's legit-prepared ice cream when it doesn't melt even after holding the cup in your hands for a good 10 minutes. Small seating area. Also, not sure why the fan was on full blast while it was 40 degrees outside. And the door was open. But that's ok Bi-Rite, your ice cream makes up for everything. In life.

Insidious, this ice cream.  I'm always craving ice cream and had always wanted to try this place, so when I "accidentally" took a wrong turn after dinner in the mission last week, I decided to just keep driving until I got here.  Illegally parked in the bus stop up the street, and waited in line for like 15 minutes which apparently isn't bad. After I had one scoop each of the coffee and the hazelnut ice cream, I thought it was good but not raveable - I was expecting something more like a gelato, instead the ice cream was good, well-balanced, but not as creamy-dreamy.  I bought the Dainty Gentleman for home, and that's what turned the corner for me.  The olive oil, sea salt sprinkled on top...  Now I can't stop thinking about going back!  I think the key is that this ice cream is very well-balanced - not too sweet, not too rich-y tasting, not icy, just really well-balanced flavor with unexpected additions like the olive oil and salt if you have the sundaes.  Mmmmmmmm.....!!!

I just recently moved here from Portland, Or & was absolutely in love with Salt & Straw Creamery up there. It was amazing & I was so sad to move because I didn't think I'd ever find anything as good. But dear lord, Bi-Rite is even better!! The flavor selection is outstanding, I had the earl grey soft serve which isn't a super crazy flavor but I have been wanting to try it forever. It is my new favorite! It was $3.50, but was the best ice cream I've ever had. I feel $3.50 is pretty standard for your medium sized cone anyway. It had the perfect flavor & wasn't too sugary which is a plus in my book, too much sugar ruins the true flavor. Just creamy tea deliciousness :)

FLAVORFUL SMOOTH AND DELICIOUS ice cream in the Mission District of San Francisco. This is the perfect place to go on a weekend afternoon. Definitely stop by if your next door at Dolores Park. The line isn't as bad as people make it out to be (15 min wait max). The icecream shop is located on the corner and they offer a range of interesting flavors with seasonal ones as well. I would definitely try the following flavors: Honey Lavender - Light but sweet icecream (goes well with a waffle cone) Salted Caramel - SWEET and SALTY what else could be better. Ricanelas- Just think Snickerdoodle and Cinnamon made a baby. Definitely will be stopping by again soon! CASH only so beware!

This will probably get lost in the sea of reviews this place has, but I felt the need to to put my 2 cents in. I've only been here a handful of times, but in my short lived experience here I've been impressed every time.  With all the selections and varieties to choose from it's really tough stepping up to give the final order.  Bi-Rite really steps up in a huge way as far as being innovative and maintaining quality with such high demand. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++­++++++++ A little Salted Caramel in the early afternoon is hard to beat!   ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++­++++++++ Parking and Waiting can be discouraging, but be patient and you won't be disappointed. Is there anything else to do on a nice day in the city across from Delores Park?  Enjoy the nice weather with a creamy dessert!

What else can be said that hasn't been already said? Came here and got the Double. My 3 flavors were Pumpkin, Creme Fraiche and the Malted Vanilla. The Malted Vanilla was filled with goodies like chocolate and peanut brittle. The vanilla was sweet and had a good vanilla flavor and the goodies were a great addition for texture and mixture for flavor as well. The Pumpkin was delicious, like a pumpkin pie but without all the hassle of making it and most definitely much smoother. My favorite of the night was the Creme Fraiche, it was sweet and simple with a trace of sourness. Somewhat like a muted yogurt, but much much better. But my favorite is still Ricanelas, its like eating a cinnamon roll and I've always had a soft spot for cinnamon rolls. And as always their ice creams were smooth, had the right texture and amount of air for the creaminess. A must try whenever anyone is in San Francisco.

So here'e the scoop - no pun intended.  The #2 best ice cream in the city (after Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous in Dogpatch).  The flavors are not to funky but oh so delicious!  newbies, be prepared to wait in line to get in and get some freshly scooped goodness and mind the time - if you go close to closing you may get locked out.

I wasn't a huge fan of the salted caramel, however the praline was simply divine. I've never tasted anything so wholesome and naturally rich. Minus 1 star for the wait time.

Bi-Rite Creamery is my #1 ice cream place in THE WORLD!!! So many unique flavors, I wish I had a stomach big enough to fit a scoop of each flavor they had. The texture and flavor of their ice cream is like no other ice cream that I've ever had. Creamy, but not as sugary as gelato. I've tried Salted Caramel and Honey Lavender, that was a great combination. But then again, I think anything with Salted Caramel is a great combination...  Oh, the sugar cone is a MUST!  It just makes the last bite of the ice cream so much more scrumptous. They usually have a long line that wraps around the corner so there have been a few times that I've had to pass on Bi-Rite because of the long line.  I went at around 11am on a weekend and there was no line though. Oh gosh, I have to stop writing this review now because my mouth just keeps watering more thinking about the ice cream.

Maybe the best ice cream iv'e ever had. The snickerdoodle one (for get what it's called, something with an R) is spectacular. I also had some of the coffee, toffee crunch, and roasted banana flavors, all of those were delicious as well. Be very careful getting the coffee float thing, the coffee is SUPER strong, I couldn't handle it, so I switched it out for a cream soda float which was great. They don't do milk shakes, I kinda wish they did but the floats are really good. The service was great as well.

My world for a little bit of sweet and a little bit of salt. Just get a pint, walk across the street to Dolores park, find a comfy spot and people watch. Bi-Rite's salter caramel made ALL that even MORE exciting than usual :) PS: Be prepared to wait for a while if you only desire individual flavors :)

I finally got to try some more flavors here. I really enjoyed the snickerdoodle cinnamon flavor. Highly recommend it! The banana flavor is also very good. Still, it's a little too creamy and rich for me. You feel the leftover layer of cream on the top of your mouth for a while after you finish your ice cream. The line moves pretty quickly, so don't be intimidated by the line!

AWESOME. As a visitor in SF, I'd been recommended this place by a friend in LA. I was told to try the salted caramel. You know what though, I rather liked Lavender Honey much better than the salted caramel. I absolutely loved that flavor, and I hope I will find a similar flavor here in LA. the reason I gave it four stars is because the stupid dude who was, even though pretty lacking in basic arithmetic skills, was nice enough to give me four samples (and I never like sampling things anywhere because having worked in a restaurant before, I know these samplers can get quite annoying,) he gave me the wrong change. It was $3.50, and I gave him $20.50, and he gave me 16.50 back. I know it's only 50 cents, but what the hell. why did i dig through my wallet to get the 50 cents if I was gonna get it back and also 50 cents short? I didn't mind but I just thought it was pretty dumb. And it wasn't like it was that busy at the time. It just goes to show you they weren't paying attention and THAT is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. I really appreciate all the samples though, and the suggestions. It's just... pay attention. Please. Thanks. I really loved the Honey Lavender, or Lavender Honey.. or whatever. I love this place.

I can see why this place is so popular! There are so many unique combination of flavors, and what makes this place so successful is that they actually pull it off! Honey lavender - really light and with a lot of floral flavors, not my cup of tea though. Roasted banana - you gotta really, really love bananas to appreciate this one I think, but if you do, it packs a true banana punch Ricanelas - exactly how they describe it: cinnamon with snickerdoodles. SO good! This ended up being my favorite at bi-rite. Salted caramel - the most popular flavor by far at bi-rite and it really is good, but just a tad too heavy and rich to me. Lines are always long here, but it moves fast so don't be put off if you see a line around the corner! Anyway, the ice cream is definitely worth the wait!

When we went there was no line! We were able to find parking down the street (thank goodness) so the walk wasn't that bad. The ice cream was a normally priced and I guess it is hand made and gourmet in a sense so you do get what you pay for (if not more!) I wouldn't say this place was amazing, but then again I didn't get the salted caramel and I was extremely tired (which may have influenced my taste buds, hahaha). I had the coffee toffee and the vanilla. I did like the little chunks of toffee in my ice cream :) two scoops in a cup was $3.50 and a soda was $1.25, I believe. (They serve cane soda). Overall it was a good experience but I'm not sure what the hype is about and I'm not sure I would make the effort to come back, especially if the line was super long.

Nothing else I would rather do in the 45 degrees pouring rain weather on a Saturday night. Pretty much sums up my first time at Bi-Rite Creamery :3 Even in the rain, the line was still out the door but who cares!! TOTALLY WORTH THE WAIT! A lot of people were raving about the salted caramel but personally, it's a bit too salty for me and I absolutely loveeeeeeeeee salted caramel so I was kinda bummed. ..but then I tried the roasted bananas and oh myyy I went bananas for it. It was so yummy I didn't need to try anything else. DONE AND DONE! Friendly service. Try anything you want before making the decision! *If you buy by the pints, you won't have to wait in line! Just go right up to the counter (:

Best sweet treat. Sure the pints are expensive (about $7) and lines are out the doors but it's worth it! Never thought I would love ice cream this much. The coffee toffee is the best ice cream! Crunchy pieces of toffee happily joined in with creamy coffee ice cream Definitely worth the wait but no wait in line if youre picking up to-go. Too bad they dont have my ice cream packed into the half gallon containers but then again, that wouldnt be too good on the waistline. I'm so happy we get to take this home to enjoy. Not a good thing that my hubby is an ice cream monster and is able to demolish both pints in 2 seconds. There's no hiding this stuff in my freezer. I will have to come up with changing the name on that label to another flavor he wouldn't eat like honey lavendar! Wish they would distribute their goods to Sacramento but it does give me a good reason to come back to the bay.

I don't usually wait in line for anything, but this is one of the few times in my life I did. Friends recommended and took me to this place near Dolores Park on my visit.  I sampled several flavors like salted caramel, honey lavender, and balsamic strawberry.  I was sold on the first two, which was simply flavorful, creamy, and soft.  I had not tasted ice cream this good for a long while, so it was a nice treat to enjoy on a warm sunny day in SF. Btw, Bi-Rite is on the list of "100 things to eat before you die", so I guess I have 99 more to go.

mmm.. SO DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!! No wonder it's got 4.5 average with a kabillion reviews. =) Is it like Scoops in So. Cal? Yes, in that it has funky awesome flavors No, in that it's got this great thick chunky yet creamy texture going on ... they must use Strauss or something... kinda reminds me of a la minute in Riverside but ice cream style. We got... Balsamic Strawberry Creme Frachie Roasted Banana Honey Graham cracker started out with two scoops... quickly added 2 more cuz they were SO good. Favorites were balsamic strawberry and creme frachie. Literally tastes and feels like you're eating the thing frozen. Many people talk about the salted caramel but since I'm not a SC fan (literally and figuratively ;)) ... I didn't order it. There's usually a wait ... cuz people take time sampling. .. but it's worth it!! A few tables inside ... fit for 10 people max? Not a lot of parking ... too many people vying for ice cream!! =) ... each "kid's scoop" comes with 2 small scoops... I think it's $2.50 / serving (2 small scoops). Can't remember.. twas too good to focus. =P

Rainy, chilly weather could not stop us from finally trying Bi-Rite! When we finally got there, we were so overwhelmed with flavor choices.  Seriously, it's like choosing between your kids.  You love them all, but if you think about it hard enough, you definitely have a favorite.  C'mon, you know it's true. Thankfully, the guy behind the counter was super friendly and let us try every single flavor.   And the one that gets to go to college is... ***drum roll*** SALTED CARAMEL!!! Yeah, no surprise there.  5000+ reviews can't be wrong.  Well they can be.  But I'm not.  Balsamic Strawberry was good too, but not my favorite. 4 Stars.  My favorite ice cream place in the world is still Scoops in LA.

LONG ASS LINES. Good thing we brought some pizzas with us from Pizza Delfina across the street to help ease the wait. Although they didn't last very long... we probably moved about 5 feet in the time we took to finish those babies off. But I digress. I'm not really the biggest fan of ice cream (yeah I'm weird) but this stuff was legit. I like how they let you try out a bunch of flavors before deciding what you want to order (probably why the wait is so damn long). I ended up getting the coffee toffee flavor which was very good. If I liked eating ice cream more, this is how I would want it to taste. Not too sweet, good creamy texture, and just a bit of crunch from the toffee. If you like ice cream and ridiculously long lines, then you will love this place :D

Another one of those places that I have never been to even though I've lived in this city for over a year now... What was I thinking?! After munching on Ike's sandwiches in Dolores Park, we walked over to Bi-Rite and hopped in line. It took about 10 minutes to get to the front of the line and I asked for a sample of their Caramel Apple -- pretty good, but I knew they could do better. I went with the trusted Salted Caramel that everyone raves about. A kid scoop with a cone on top for $2.50. One bite into it and I knew exactly what everyone was talking about. So good! That little kid-sized scoop was all I needed, too! If I'm ever in the area again, I'm splitting Sam's Sundae with a friend. Would I go again? YES! Bonus points for using metal spoons for samples :)

I count 25 friend reviews for Bi-Rite, far beyond any other place I've reviewed. I think it's time to add my 2 cents. If it's your first time, the long line is well worth it. Their flavor selection is just so mindblowing that you'll need that time to decide. Do I want honey lavender or salted caramel? Creme fraiche or brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl? You'll be drooling over the flavors so much you just might end up getting it all. To break my Bi-Rite virginity, I got two scoops: Roasted Banana and White Chocolate Raspberry Swirl. Decadently creamy, not too sweet, and no additives that mask the flavor. If you order banana, you're going to taste some straight up bad-ass roasted banana, without the loads of extra sugar. Dolores Park on a weekend recovery Sunday with a small cup of Bi-Rite. Does it get much better than that?

I've always wanted to try Bi-Rite and their infamous Salted Caramel ice cream. One beautiful and rare warm fall day, my friend and I decided to go to Dolores Park. Across the street was Bi-Rite Creamery. It was a perfect time to try what I have always been craving. We waited a good 30 minutes in line. While asking for some samples, I was handled a metal spoon of a flavor. While trying to put it in the dirty spoon cup, I totally missed and it fell right into the Coffee Toffee ice cream. I felt horrible, so I decided to order what the spoon fell in. I love coffee ice cream anyways. With that, I also ordered Salted Caramel of course. Once we got our order, we walked to Dolores Park and enjoyed our ice cream. First and foremost, the salted caramel ice cream was delicious but it wasn't remarkable to me. I haven't craved it ever since, so yeah, the hype was a big disappointment to me. I am a huge salt/sweet palette fan and this didn't really tickle that fancy of mine. The biggest let down was when I tried the Coffee Toffee flavor. I mean, these are two things I loved, combined. When I ate it, it tasted so nasty to me! I didn't taste any toffee only a weird bitterness that I couldn't palette. If I knew what a dirty ass tasted like, I would believe it would taste like this ice cream flavor. I couldn't even finish it and I didn't want it to mingle with my Salted Caramel, so I ate around it and tried to finish my Salted Caramel as fast as I could. I have never not like an ice cream I've met before. I mean, I even eat Cheese and Corn ice cream. So you can't imagine how gravely dissappointed I was and couldn't even take another bite. It was just that gross to me. It was such a surprise. Will I try this place again? Maybe, if the line was miraculously short, I will venture to try other flavors. However, they were the only ones that served me an ice cream that I couldn't eat!!!

We marked our map to enjoy some ice cream near Dolores Park, but neglected to write down what shop to hit up! So I decided to track down the most local-looking person to ask.  Yes, I'm ballz like that :) Me: *chasing a cute couple before they cross the street*  Excuse me! Couple: *turns around looking extremely puzzled* Me: What's the best ice cream shop around here? Couple: Oh Bi-Rite definitely. Me: Awesome! Where is it? Couple: Oh just... cross the street and stand in that line over there. I think it's no coincidence that the most popular creamery was only footsteps away. Though the long line that wrapped around the corner of the street likely would have been a green light on deliciousness!  They're also very generous with samples which is a huge plus. After sampling 3 or 4 flavors my cousin and I decided to split a 2 scoop order. We decided to indulge in Brown Sugar and the critically acclaimed Salted Caramel. Both were delicious though the Brown Sugar was the winner in my book.   A great spot to treat your taste buds to a childhood classic and be sure to enjoy it at the park!

Long lines don't lie. Bi-Rite is still a top ice cream spot in the city. This time I tried their malted vanilla. It was too good, made with chunks of toffee candy swirled into the ice cream. Price: $2.50 for a kid's sized scoop. A small treat, just the right size after a hearty dinner.

Bi-Rite always has new and interesting flavors every time I go there. My personal favorite is the toasted coconut.

**5 STARS** relative to: Ice cream Omg. I don't usually scream for ice cream but I will scream for Bi-Rite's ice cream. I don't know how they came up with such perfect ice cream, but I gotta give it to them. What makes me love this place, in addition to having such perfect consistency ice cream, is the uniqueness of their flavors.  Where else can you find balsamic strawberry and honey lavender and some of their other out-of-the-ordinary flavors? I wish some of their special flavors were more permanent. **Favorites**  Salted caramel & Earl Grey. I love the roasty notes of the salted caramel and I love the subtlety of the Earl grey.  I don't even like to drink the actual tea, but I found out here that I love the ice cream.  They don't always have that flavor though. Makes me wanna cry. **Recommend?**  A must try in San Francisco :-)  If you can appreciate quality ice cream, then you'll understand the hype.

Holy two scoops of HEAVEN! I like that I have the choice of one scoop being broken down into two smaller scoops so that I can try different flavors. Of course I had to try the SALTED CARAMEL that everyone's buzzing about and boy did it not disappoint! It really does taste like a rich caramel chew. HONEY LAVENDER also grabbed my attention on the menu. It is sublime... Mmmm... I wish I could fly back right now!

I visited Bi-Rite Creamery this past weekend after reading about them on Yelp.   I've heard stories about long lines but we went on a Saturday afternoon and were the only ones there. Ambiance: Quaint and casual. Service:  Friendly and very accommodating for food allergies. Food (gluten-free dairy-free perspective): They had two dairy free flavor options during my visit. They were very friendly and offered tastes of both (a grapefruit sorbet and a chocolate coconut).  I enjoyed both but opted for the grapefruit in the end on a gluten-free cone.  The cone was your standard sugar-cone, which you can buy in many specialty grocers.  Their ice cream is reasonably priced and I definitely intend on returning.

I'd heard about bi-rite, the go 2 ice-cream place in the mish for the hipster generation and thought, well, i'm a lifelong San Franciscan, let me check it out. Must say the salted caramel is really delicious and unusual but the place was a little too  packed, the seating a little toocramped and the line too long. Frankly Mitchell's is the better bet. Bigger scoops, faster line and bigger selection...MC

Every flavor here is rich and creamy with a smooth finish! The deep, toasted flavor of the salted caramel ice cream is just unparalleled to any other version I've tried. Take a scoop of the creme fraiche to go along with it - its lush and tart finish will perfectly balance with the bold, dark flavors of the caramel.

After a not too satisfying burger from Big Mouth Burger (read my review), we wanted something sweet to cap off the night; not to mention to quiet the grumbling stomachs. I knew Bi-Rite is popular but I never would have expected the line to go around the street corner.  Good thing it moved fast.  After about 20 minutes we made it inside.  I got myself a single with 2 flavors.  the Salted caramel was very toasty & caramel'y.  It wasn't too sweet but it wasn't really salty either.  My 2nd flavor was the Malted vanilla which didn't taste like much compared to the salted caramel but I really liked the texture of the peanut brittle that was inside. It's not likely that I will return here often, but return I will.  In the mean time, it's time to do some research into which flavors are worth getting!

i came here for my birthday with my boyfriend and my best friend. we had just come from a yummy dinner, so it was probably already 7-8 or so. the line was incredibly long!!!! i heard of these crazy lines, but ive never experienced it till that day hahaha. since my friend was on a tight schedule and had to go home and pack, we decided to opt out from the line and go to the bri-rite window next door. We got the coffee sundae and it was delicious! the almonds were super good and ice cream was rich and creamy! the fudge was sweet too. Usually for sundaes, i have to rest between bites bc it gets too sweet for me, but this was just perfect! next time, im definitely gonna go wait in line. heard the lavender and salted caramel is super good!

So this is how the battle of Salted Caramel v Peach Sorbet v Maple Walnut went down. First taste - the refreshing taste of Peach Sorbet shoots ahead on an unusually warm sf day Half way - it's neck and neck between the Peach Sorbet and the creamy sweetness and nuttiness of the Maple Walnut who have a clear lead on the Salted Caramel that has left me confused by it's overpowering slightly burnt after taste (why is it that my ice-cream tastes buds are different from the majority of the world?!) Last bite - and the winner is..... Maple Walnut!!!!  The sweetness and creaminess surged ahead and left the peach sorbet tasting all but sour at the end Only wish I could've gone to bi-rite again for another ice-cream taste race.

My expectation was high before trying this place. One recent yahoo article ranked Bi-rite one of the top 10 ice cream shops in the nation and I know I got to try it out. These are the ice cream I tested and how I think about each of them.. 1. Salted caramel: burnt sugar..sounds easy right? no! It is a very challenging ice cream. The burning process must be well under control, other wise, it will taste either too bitter or too sweet. The one I tried was too bitter and having gritty texture. A good ice cream should not have a gritty texture. It is an indication that the ingredient is not well incorporated, and the water is crystallized in the ice cream. This is an issue any good ice cream shop should be aware of. 2. Honey lavender: Such a beautiful  name for an ice cream! The texture of this ice cream was better than the salted caramel. It was indeed creamy, but the design of this ice cream is definitely not the best in my opinion. In this ice cream, lavender is the emphasis, so the moment the ice cream melted in my tongue, all I can taste is a very pungent lavender flavor as if a drop of lavender extract was on my tongue. I think the lavender extract should provide a good smell and a subtle taste to the ice cream, and should not be the main flavor. I guess there are people that love the lavender taste, but I personally do not like it. 3. Roasted banana: I only get a spoonful of this to test. The banana flavor is too strong to my taste. I am guessing it is because they roast the banana, so the sweetness and flagrant are more concentrated comparing to a simply ripen banana. However, I think it was too sweet that the ice cream become almost too dense and lose its fluffiness. I have tried Jeni's ice cream in Columbus, Ohio, and I honestly think that if Bi-rite is good, then Jeni's must be supreme in terms of flavor, texture, creativity and most importantly, the design of the ice cream. To me, Jeni's ice cream have a better balance of everything, and each ice cream is well constructed. If you can find a pint of Jeni's ice cream in Bristol farm, try it (expensive but worth it) and you know what I am talking about. I might be very critical here..but yea, I was disappointed..I kept thinking that it might just be a bad day in their kitchen. I hope I can go back again soon and try their other flavors.

Cute small little shop! Often a line, but it goes quick! They have a nice variety of soft serves, flavorful hard scoops and amazing sundaes! I love the ricanelas! Cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodle pieces! mmm.. The trifecta is amazing = a scoop salted caramel, brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl, and malted vanilla topped with peanut brittle and chocolate! love in a cup! The fall seasonal trio is even more amazing!!! Three scoops of pumpkin, caramel apple & ricanelas ice creams! Perfectly FALL warm comfort flavors. Tastes like all the best desserts of Thanksgiving together! Also love Toasted Coconut, Coffee Toffee, Honey Lavender and Roasted Banana! I like the Salted Caramel but it can get a little smokey or bitter on some days (the taste of sugar alcohols). If I lived in the area, I'd be buying the pints!

The standard for all other scream shoppes.   I will now present my evidence that Birite is in fact a "gateway drug". I started with a single scoop of chocolate.  Once I was hooked on that, I made it to 2 scoops, one salted caramel, the other would be a sweet flavor, like honey lavender or snickerdoodle.  From there I got hooked on their homemade whipped cream, and that inevitably lead me to add hot fudge to my two scoops.  It all coalesced in my final trip to Birite where I had a sunday with brownie, three scoops, whipped cream, and hot fudge.  It was here that I "met my maker". Be careful what you wish for, and just remember that I used to be like you and it all started with just a single scoop.

Worth the cliched wait in line. Yeah yeah, it's the mission. There's tons of good ice creameries but lets be honest- you just are craving biRite.  Who can resist the classic salted caramel or the toffee coffee?!?  The line moves fast particularly if its a nice day and you're out with your friends. They kindly pass the flavor menu out in line so you have plenty of time to deliberate before you reach the front.  If you can't wait for the line, squeeze by to the other window and grab some quick soft serve.  If you live close by there's take home cartons and of course ice cream sandwiches!!

Bi-Rite is one of the most popular ice cream shops in SF for a good reason: it's phenomenal. It's creamy and buttery, but not over-the-top like Mitchell's. It has interesting flavors, but not too weird like Humphry Slocombe. Bi-Rite is the most consistently-delicious ice cream in the city. ---------------- Over the course of many visits, I've tried numerous flavors, but the ones that really stand out to me are... Ricanellas (Snickerdoodle) = My favorite ice cream flavor at Bi-Rite. It has the perfect amount of cinnamon sweetness, with fat chunks of snickerdoodle cookies mixed in. I can eat this all day everyday and never get sick of it. Coffee Toffee = If you love coffee, you'll love this one. I'm actually not a fan of toffee because I think it's way too sweet, but the toffee in this actually blends with coffee quite well. Great flavor. Olive Oil = I love olive oil ice cream and I think Bi-Rite does it really well. I still like the Olive Oil at Humphry Slocombe better, but Bi-Rite is a solid second. Burnt Butter = Delicious. The brown sugar flavor works perfectly with the butter. Good with almonds. ---------------- Bi-Rite is one of those places that's so popular and well-loved that you just want to dislike it so that you're not a sheep in the "fad" herd. Try all you want, but Bi-Rite is just too damn good to dislike.

Like many other Yelper's, I decided to come here with my friends after eating our Ike's sandwiches at Dolores Park. Since everybody and their mommas know about this place, there are two VIP lines you must stand in before you can actually order. This took about 15 minutes in the hot, hot, hot sun. I ordered the Ricanelas and Salted Caramel which I thought were really good. The Salted Caramel was super intense in flavor and you could tell that they did not skimp on the ingredients. I liked it, but I enjoyed my Ricanela more (maybe it's because I love anything cinnamon and snickerdoodle). Minus one star for the server that gave me an attitude when I made sure I got the correct ice cream. Not cool.

I hadn't been to Bi-Rite in a little while so it was nice to go back again.  I had my usual Brownie Sundae, which was amazing.  My only complaint was that since the last time I'd been there, they changed the number of scoops from 3 to 2...how can I just have two ice cream flavors on my sundae?!?!? It's still amazing so I won't complain too much... Also, I tried their Dark Chocolate ice cream and it was pretty phenomenal.  Rich ice cream with deep, dark chocolate flavor...I love this place!

Solid ice cream with some interesting flavors.  Nothing way above many of the other gourmet places in the city though.  The strawberry balsamic and ricanelas were my favorites, but it's great to try the seasonal flavors too. The line can look daunting, but it moves pretty fast for the most part.  A way around if you know what you want is to get a pint from the freezer and you won't have to wait in line!

I came here for the infamous Salted Caramel Ice Cream featured in the 7x7 Big Eats. http://www.7x7.com/big-e… I must have come on a good day because there was no line when I went. I was expecting the best ice cream of my life - Bi-Rite definitely came up short. I don't see the hype around the Salted Caramel. Neither I nor my boyfriend liked it. It just wasn't good. We ended up getting the Almond Fudge Swirl, which I really liked. You could actually taste the almond flavor, and it came with little almond chunks in it. Yum. Would I come back? Maybe, but only if there wasn't a long line. If you choose to stop by, check out Dolores Park (it's across the street). It's a huge grassy area that always has a lot of stuff going on.

We came here obviously because of the rave reviews and the fact that it is the most reviewed business on Yelp.  We stood in line for 30 minutes to try the famous ice cream.  After we finally ate some, we both thought that the ice cream was good.  Both worth the wait?  I dunno about that.. For 5000+ reviews, I expected the ice cream to be mind-blasting (Not mind-blowing, but mind-blasting!, in Russel Peter's voice..)  But it wasn't mind-blasting, and not worth waiting 30 minutes for...in my opinion.

When you see a long line for something, you should get in it. Something awesome is at the end of it. Otherwise, why would everyone be waiting? We had two vastly different experiences going to Bi-Rite. The first time, there was no absolutely no line and when we got our order, the consensus was that the place was overhyped and that the ice cream had nothing particularly extraordinary about it. We didn't go for months, but then decided to try again because everyone keeps raving about this place. This time, there was a long line--so long, in fact, that the line was segmented into three separate parts so that the sidewalk doesn't get completely blocked by a wall of people. We we waited in this line for at least a half an hour and ordered some flavors we had before and some new ones. The experience this time was completely different. We were both wowed by the flavors. I would rank this among the best ice creams I've had in my life. What changed? All i could think of was that long line. Something magic happens when you stand in lines waiting for things.

An hour wait for ice cream, but TOTALLY WORTH IT. Every flavor was so unique that you really can't go wrong with any of them. Favorite combination though: Strawberry Balsamic and Roasted Banana. Completely divine. I guess if I really had to rate them, this would be the ranking (from the flavors I've tried) 1. Roasted Banana 2. Strawberry Balsamic 3. Salted Caramel 4. White Chocolate Raspberry 5. Coffee Toffee 6. Brown Sugar 7. Honey Lavender 8. Olive Oil I must say though, although delicious, there are a few places in LA that definitely lives up to this standard with less waiting or no line. So if you love Bi-rite but is visiting LA and craving some yummy ice cream, head to Scoops or Carmela. I guarantee that you won't be disappointed. For a different type of soft serve but heavenly experience, try 21 choices!

After hearing my friend from SF rant and rave about Bi-Rite Creamery being her all time go to favorite ice cream spot, I had to go try it!  She did not fail me, it was indeed really good! they had lots of flavors to choose from.   The flavors ranged from pretty standard flavors ie. cookies and cream, mint chips, vanilla to rather unique flavors ie. the balsamic strawberry, honey graham, honey lavender. They gave sample tastings to help you better order. Boy was it hard. there were so many gooood flavors i wanted to order but i limited myself to two flavors.   i ended up ordering myself the balsamic strawberry and creme fraiche. BEST decision ever. the combination of both were wooweee. :)  i'd def come back

A friend took me here over the weekend and I'm in love with their salted caramel! Very delicious! I paired it with their honey lavender and it was perfect! This particular rainy day there was no line, so it was perfect! But be prepared for a line. It is rather pricey, but it is quality ice cream & on this day, service was superb! Sometimes the flavor can be overwhelming, so make sure to try and pair two flavors that can balance each other. A friend commented that the banana tastes like she was eating 10 bananas and had a hard time finishing 1 scoop!

My trek up North would not have been complete without a visit to the famous Bi-Rite Creamery. I've heard much praise that I was ready to be impress by their ice cream. Arriving at the store, I was amazed at the line that was formed. In Socal, a line can mean a good or bad thing. So, I prepared myself to be wow and disappointed. The first thing you'll noticed about Bi-Rite are the favors which each has their own uniqueness. Right away I was drawn to the roasted banana and toasted coconut. Both were creamy and you can taste the nuttiness of the toasted coconut! I was able to try the balsamic strawberry, malted vanilla, and white chocolate raspberry which were excellent. You really can't go wrong with whatever you choose since you can sample any favors that are available. I left Bi-Rite highly satisfied with the ice cream and the reasonable pricing of everything. You can purchase favors by the pint just by passing the line and walking right up the registered. For those who wish to have the whole experience, waiting in line took about 20 mins and we started near the traffic signal on 18th St. Parking sucked for the most part. I understand that San Francisco is a walking type of city, but when you're tourist you're probably going to bring your car. Parking is going to be difficult and I had to circled the blocks several times before I found a parking spot. So my suggestion is to find a lot nearby (if possible) and spend time in that general area.

Foods high in saturated fats have a tendency to clog arteries, so one must be selective in the fatty foods department - I save myself for trips to BiRite! They never let me down and are more than happy to give tastes if I'm skeptical of a flavor (lavendar ice cream anyone?). Great place to bring out-of-towners, too.

Can't believe this is my first time at Bi-Rite! I consider myself sort of an ice cream enthusiast. What can I say, there's always room for ice cream in my tummy!! So, when at a bridal shower up in Napa last weekend, my friend mentioned this ice cream place and sure enough, we had to make a stop before leaving the bay area on Sunday. The line. Wow, I mean, I knew we were in SF, where people can be more snippy, but right when we figured out the line situation, this Asian girl, say no more than 25 says with attitude and smirk, "Yeah, no line cutting here!" Geez, give me a break! It's our first time here, and it's not exactly obvious when the street is crowded with people, and the line is divided into three sections. It's not like we were making sneak attack move on you people. Plus, what's the point in saying that as we're walking towards the back of the line? Enough with that, let's move onto what's really important. The ice cream. It's very creamy and flavorful. All the flavors are true to their ingredients, which shows that they use fresh ingredients and are made daily. The basil tastes just like eating a basil leaf, the honey lavender tastes like you're eating a bar of lavender soap, and ricanelas tastes just like what is it: cinnamon with snickerdoodles. Overall, the flavors were just too true to their ingredients, and I wasn't sure if that's what I wanted in an ice cream. However, I went with my gut instincts and ended up with two scoops: strawberry balsamic and salted caramel. I didn't get to try the flavors I actually decided on because I wasn't satisfied with the many flavors I did try and didn't want to hold the line up further. My first bite into the balsamic strawberry: Hm, tastes just like strawberry except not as sweet but still very creamy and strawberrylike. I've never actually tried the balsam flavor from plants before other than in the form of balsamic vinegar, so I couldn't really say that I could taste that flavor in the ice cream. There was definitely no hint of sourness like in the vinegar, and if anything, it probably added some sweetness to the ice cream that the strawberries were lacking. Basically, you can never go wrong with strawberry ice cream, and Bi-Rite delivers. Salted Caramel: right when I ordered it, my friend goes, "Did you get to try it? It's very strong" I go, "No, but I love salted caramel anything" The lesson is, at Bi-Rite be sure to try EVERYTHING because they are way too true to their flavors. Have I exhausted this fact yet? I was definitely taken aback after my first bite. There was a strong burnt caramel flavor. It was actually a bit offputting. However, I'm sure like most of their flavors, the ice cream just tasted better and better with each bite. It wasn't as burnt anymore and I could actually appreciate the flavor of the caramel through the rich creaminess of their ice cream. Overall, yes, I wasn't used to the authenticity of flavors from ice cream, but now that I've tried, I don't think I can go back to Haagan Daz. Who am I kidding, it's ice cream. Of course I'll eat it!!

My friends brought me here to prove to me this is the best ice cream creamary ever. OK so the line is super long and supposed suppose to go by fast. But it was a Andy day and the sun was just OK peaking through the clouds. Instead we went to get individual pints because it was faster service. Which true !! I got coffee toffee for ~$8 a pint. Omg I think it maybe the best $8 I've ever spend on ice cream. The selection I felt was pretty limited. If you're not sure, stand in line and try it out then. Parking is a pain. Just fyi

Well my cousins, friend and I went to Bi-rite, wondering what would behold us there. It was a nice little hole in the wall place in the Mission district that apparently my uncle does signs for. Little did I know, that I'd be blown away by the fantastic ice cream! I tried their Salted Caramel and it was great but I'm not all that into caramel unless chocolate's involved. The roasted banana and the trifecta flavors were what made me get a cup of my own! So creamy and the ice cream tastes so good it's hard to say no! They also had cookies and macaroons (YES MACAROONS not that french  MACARONS pastry, which are totally different) not to mention ice cream sandwiches. The staff was very friendly, helpful and you could shoot the breeze with them and they were down for a good chat. I like that about these small places. Luckily for us, there was no line so we got in and got our ice cream fast. The only thing I didn't like were the seats, it was kind of awkward seating. Honestly, at least there was a place to sit so I can't give them one less star because of that. All in all, great ice cream, worth the visit and it's at a reasonable price!

You know how clubs always keep their bar lines 3 or 4 deep to get people to buy more drinks when they finally get to the front of the line? That's how you end up walking out of Bi-Rite with a triple-scoop cone. I REGRET NOTHING.

The seasonal flavor Basil is delicious!!!! Must try! :) I also tried the other seasonal flavors: White Chocolate Raspberry, Balsamic Strawberry, and Olive Oil. They were all good, but not as divine as Basil! Also, the Salted Caramel today was kind of bitter, almost burnt flavor (hence -1 star from my original review). But I'm pretty sure it's just today cause the other times I've had Salted Caramel, it was just perfect.

Bi-Rite is the 50 Shades of Gray of the ice cream world.  Delicious and slightly naughty. This creamery is absolutely delicious.  The ice cream flavors will leave you begging for more wet, creamy goodness. (This is starting to sound like one of those trashy novels) Okay I'll stop before I get censored....lol Bottom line is this, if you want cool, creamy creations then come here.  The flavors are eclectic but good.  They lose a star for operating such a popular place with little to no seating.  It's SF so I won't even mention the parking situation....lol

Wow with nearly 5000 reviews, there's not much else to say about Bi-Rite.  I personally enjoy their ice cream sandwiches.  They're huge, but the cookies are a bit too brittle.  Can't go wrong with the brown butter cookie with coffee sandwich in their fridge. The texture of the ice cream here is a bit heavier than Ici, but still light enough to be refreshing.  I like to think of Bi-Rite as the San Francisco brother of its sister Ici in Berkeley.  The shop is small and the lines are long!  I recommend getting your fix and walking around Delores instead of hanging around the crowds.  Cheers!

Yummy ice cream! I loved how they had such interesting options (Basil, Balsamic Strawberry, Olive Oil, Roasted Banana, etc). I got the White Chocolate Raspberry and Salted Caramel. Delicious! I recommend getting it in a cup since the cone didn't really taste that great. Yes, the line was long, but it goes by SUPER fast, since the store is small itself and people don't really sit there and eat. So I thought it was worth it even though the line only seemed long. I didn't feel like I waited for a long time.

Bomb assss ice cream. The people I came with didn't like my honey lavender but it was my fave out of the 3 flavors I got (salted caramel & balsamic strawbs). I like how you can split a single scoop into 2 flavors and into 3 for dubscoops etc etc. Variety is key. Also there was a bit of a line... I think it was Friday afternoon but so what. Long lines don't phase me.

I am not a huge dessert/ice cream person but I still find myself waiting around the block for Bi-Rite. My favorites are the Strawberry Balsamic and the Snickerdoodle. TIP: If you want to skip the line (and don't mind getting a pint), you can go to the market down the block (towards Valencia) to pick up the ice cream.

Being a visitor of San Francisco, we felt like good dessert, so we naturally yelpped and found this cute little ice creamery. It had thousands of reviews so I assumed it had to be good. I tried their pomegranate/orange sorbet and their coffee toffee. Both were good, but I think I expected something a little more different.  Service was cool. I just felt a little rushed since a line was starting to form behind me and all the staff seemed to speed up their service. Would I go again? Probably..if the line is short enough.

Hit the spot after eating Indian.  Hardly a line around 7:15pm. Kudos to the staff. I've been holding on to a gift card.  They switched to a new computer system which meant my gift card was no longer in sync. They converted it to the latest one and COMP our cones tonight for our inconvenience.  Now that is customer service. And I especially enjoyed my ice cream tonight.  Honey lavender and balsamic strawberry on a sugar cone.  Hubby had the brown sugar.

Tried the salted caramel and the earl grey. I fell in love with the earl grey, I probably would have given up my new year resolution to eat this everyday for a year. The salted caramel was pretty good but I preferred the earl grey. We waited in line for 10-15mins and was finally able to get inside. It's a pretty cute/small creamery with a few seats. Parking took 20mins, we circled around the neighborhood to find a spot. I definitely prefer this, over Fentons.

With two of the top 10 ice creams in the U.S. being from Ohio, I am definitely an ice cream snob! It's hard to find an ice cream shop that beats my personal favorites from back home. After seeing Bi-Rite on the list as well, I had to make a stop during my visit to SF! The line was fairly long, but moved quickly. We only had about a 10-15 minute wait. I'm not a huge fan of overly sweet ice cream, but the salted caramel was by far my favorite flavor! The honey lavender was refreshing as well! And if you're up for more ice cream, buy some of their soft serve next door! Bi-Rite is definitely a great ice cream shop, but it still doesn't beat the two from Ohio! ;)

I looooove ice cream. So much so that I'm petitioning to have human-confection marriage approval on the next state ballot.  Visiting Bi-Rite has only increased my unholy dessert lust further. Their ice creams are hand-crafted and taste like it; flavor bursts from each spoonful.  Example: I don't even particularly like bananas, but the banana-flavored ice cream was spiritually touching in a religious way.  I actually cried for two minutes.  I just wish they had more basic fruit flavors like my beloved strawberry (sorbet doesn't count!).

Not gonna lie. Bi-Rite is pretty bomb. I've had some pretty good ice cream around the place, but Bi-Rite is legit. I'm leaning more toward a 4.5, but hesitant to round it up to a five just because I've also had ice cream at Toscanini's which was quite the experience itself. My friend and I were extremely lucky to make it during a time where the line wasn't too bad, although I definitely understand why it's good enough to line up for. Bi-Rite has a lot of quirky flavors such as Roasted Bananas, ricanelas, olive oil, etc etc, and the reason it distinguishes itself as a successful ice cream store is because it pulls off these quirky flavors well. Also, the same spoons are metal rather than plastic which makes the place seem that much classier. I got the Roasted Banana and Salted Caramel. Mmm good stuff. Roasted banana tasted... exactly like roasted banana which obviously seems intuitive, but soooo good. My friend got Coffee Toffee and Honey Lavender. The Coffee Toffee was extremely coffee flavored and honey lavender was good although I'm not really a big fan of honey lavender. I think Bi-Rite is also cool because you can get two flavors in their smallest cup--yay for more deliciousness! Prices are pretty decent :) tldr; gogogogogo! try a crazy flavor :)

If you go after dinner, there are always a long line in front, but it's worth the wait. Love their salted caramel and coffee ice cream! Really strong flavor in every bite/lick.

Worth the wait! While in line for 20 mins, I kept reminding myself  "Nearly 5,000 reviews with a 4.5 star rating, this place has to be special!" Oh boy, was it! When you finally come into the shop itself you get a cozy feeling. The hipsters working behind the counter are a friendly bunch and don't hesitate in asking you if you want to take a taste sample. You can taste all the flavors that are on display. They will hand you a metal spoon and you simply discard them on the counter top one at a time as you go through the flavors. I got the single which is either one big scoop of the one ice cream or two smaller scoops of different ice creams. I went with the two different scoops, 'to widened my horizons' and ordered the honey lavender and toasted coconut. Toasted coconut was pretty good. Although the star of the show was the Honey Lavender is creamy in texture and aromatic in scent, that it dances in your mouth. I savored every millisecond of it. Hey they accept card too, that's a plus. After getting my ice cream we decided to walk over to Dolores Park and I wondered if if my ice cream would even make it across the street because I was just mowing through. I barely crossed the corner and I was already looking for a trash can to throw away my empty cup. Crazy enough, I thought about crossing the street and jumping back in line to get more ice cream. I'll be back Bi-Rite! Would I be back? This place is now in my to do list whenever I am back in The City.

I think this place is overrated. Not to say I dislike Bi-Rite, but between fervent word-of-mouth and enormous lines, they were hyped up to be the end-all-be-all of San Francisco ice cream and I don't think they are. They're a contender certainly and make very good ice cream, but I think the bulk of their reputation and hype comes from the fact that they're directly adjacent to Dolores Park. Their texture is a tad too light for me. It gives a little bit too easily for me under the spoon. Prefer the heavier feel of Mitchell's. They tend to have strong but subtle flavors, not the BAM in-your-face sharpness of Humphry Slocombe. Balsamic strawberry is probably my favorite. Roasted banana and toasted coconut are up there. I found salted caramel to be pretty overhyped; good flavor, but I've had better and I thought it could use some actual sea salt crystals. Brown sugar was too sweet for me. Ricanellas was tasty.

I've eaten a lot of ice cream in my life and this is one of the best I've had.  I'm madly in love with the ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodle pieces).  I've sampled some of their other flavors and,  while they are delicious, I always return to my favorite. You may see a huge line wrapping around the block for Bi-Rite, but I swear there are other times when there is no line at all.  (Also, the best things come to those who wait.  So grab a friend and relax in the line for a bit.)  A friend and I went at 5:15pm on a week day and sauntered right up to the counter without a wait.  And, on a perfect day, there is nothing like bringing your ice cream over to Dolores park and relaxing.  Just remember, if it is sunny out you'll want it in a bowl or it will drip all over you. The service has always been great.  Although I'll admit, it is a bit pricey but well worth the money.  If there is a line, don't expect to sample more than two flavors.  And if you are in a hurry, skip the line and just purchase a pint!

LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! The salted caramel is a must try here! it is so creamy and delicious. My friend and I came here after we picked up a sandwich. =]  we actually ate our sandwich as we waited. The line was pretty long but it is really worth the wait. The line was organized and they have spots set up already which is really nice. Once inside it is a quick order and they give it to you and then your on your way. We got the salted caramel and that was delicious! We also got the white chocolate raspberry swirl. This one is like and is great after eating a heavy dinner etc. I like the raspberry swirl in it. We also tried the brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl! that was super good too! sweet and creamy!

I am from Vancouver, and I have always been a huge gelato fan. I never really liked ice cream. As a matter of fact, the only time I ever eat ice cream really, is when I am having cravings in the middle of the night. This is when I'll head over to Safeway and I'll treat myself to a small cup of Haagen daaz or Ben & Jerry's. Anyways, when I arrived at Bi-Rite and saw the huge line up, I was thinking to myself hmm this better be well worth the dang wait! Cause I have never waited 40 minutes in my life for ice cream. Oh yes, it was DEFINITELY well worth the 40 minutes of my life and all I can say is Ice cream will never be the same again! I ordered a scoop of the salted caramel and the toasted coconut. Honestly, I don't even know how to describe how amazing their ice-cream is. The texture is thick and creamy--it was PERFECT. The bf had chocolate and white chocolate with raspberry. The white chocolate with raspberry was absolutely delicious. The chocolate was good too, but it wasn't outstanding like the rest of the flavors. I can't wait to return to SF so I can go to Bi-Rite again, for their creamery goodness!

Expect a line, if not..dang you lucky! Salted caramel is more of a burnt caramel taste aka the shell of creme brulee. So if you like that, this be delish DELISH delish. Not quite a salty kick, more of a burnt flavor than anything else. BUT I LOVE BURNT FOOD, SO IT WAS FABULOUS! Basil is pretty good as well. Not as odd as you may think. It's a seasonal flavor, so catch it before you have to wait for it to come back around. The brown sugar with ginger and caramel swirl was sweet and tasty. No ginger taste at all, so don't worry about that if you hate ginger. Olive oil is a bit plain. It does have the olive oil flavor though. The price is fair and I like getting regular with 3 different flavors on a cone.

While this place is so convenient on a sunny day while your at Dolores Park, the wait is ridiculously long!  It's worth waiting for if its your first time trying it, cause they have delicious flavors like balsamic strawberry (which is seasonal) or salted caramel, but other than that, if the lines too long for me, I'll skip it.

After waiting in a loooonnnggg line and watching several people cut in front of me (wasn't in a very confrontational mood this particular afternoon) I was finally at the front, salivating over every single flavor there. I was pretty stressed out considering the extremely difficult decision at hand (single scoop or double scoop? coffee toffee, salted caramel, balsamic strawberry, or brown sugar? three flavors or two??) The combinations were endless, and I was starting to feel overwhelmed. Thankfully the worker behind the counter was understanding and kept on handing me spoon after spoon of different flavors to try (none of that '2 tastes only' bullshit other creameries have). After much deliberation, I decided on the single size on a cone with brown sugar and coffee toffee. Delicious. We decided to enjoy our ice cream cones at Dolores. However, by the time we reached our blankets I had already inhaled my cone of ice cream. Oops. If you're impatient, you can bypass the line and pick up a cake/ sandwich/ pint from the freezer next to the cashier. Will be back!

Worth the wait. Worth the hype. Worth the bite. (wow i'm so corny) the wait seriously is not exaggerated. It is like waiting for a ride in Disneyland. I mean, I went on a Saturday afternoon so that was a bad idea. But the people are very nice and you can always meet a cute girl or guy in line sometimes. **If you want to just buy a pint of ice cream.. you don't have to wait! Just walk in and head to the fridge like you just don't care! Flavors: honey lavender if you like flower flavors (like rose milk tea or rose infused tea) is great, but like I said, if you don't like flower flavors then stay away from that. Salted caramel.. everybody recommends it so you may as well get it right! happy ice screaming!

A line around the block isn't usually my style, but you can dash inside and buy a pint without waiting in line.  The same selection of flavors is available at the actual store down the street too. A+ for creativity with the flavors.  So far we've tried honey lavender (favorite), Mexican chocolate, salted caramel (careful, this one is rather melty due to the salt content), rocky road, and balsamic strawberry (needs more balsalmic).  I look forward to trying more flavors.

SF Street Food Fest 2012. Note, this is not a review for the ice cream, just my experience at the Food Fest which had limited items. - Watermelon popsicle ($2) My sister got the watermelon popsicle which was a very pretty pink color. It came packaged in a plastic bag, which was a little hard to unwrap actually since the popsicle was that frozen. Anyway, I tried some and it literally tasted like what I would imagine if I ate frozen watermelon. Very authentic taste and seems like it's just made of fresh watermelon with no artificial flavoring. There were some white seeds inside, which I wasn't sure was intentional or not, but solid popsicle!

I don't get the hype. Location, location. Bi-rite's location is prime: right at the crossroad between Mission and the Castro, across the street from Dolores Park.  The ice-cream is nothing to write home about. Texture is too soft and it lacks that richness and creaminess that I prefer. Toasted coconut is not even in the same league as Mitchell's baby coconut flavor. It has a slight burned flavor. Chocolate is okay. The portion is also much smaller compared to Mitchell. Two double cones $10

First of all I love ice cream and everything about it, so I had to check out this famous San Francisco ice cream shop. It was a long line but I didn't feel it took that long... The store is really busy so I guess I should understand impatient and rude service but it still kind of left a sour impression... On to flavors... -Honey Lavender: Tasted a little too much like flowers for my liking. It was quite strong... Even though I knew it was lavender, I strangely expected it would taste like jasmine but nope definitely lavender. -Coffee Toffee: The coffee was yummy kind of tasted like a haagen daz ice cream... So i guess it's nothing really special. -Salted Caramel: I am NOT a huge fan of caramel... In fact, I dislike caramel but this was really good and unexpected. I didn't find it too sweet like I usually do. Mine had almonds topped on so I felt it was extra tasty. -Strawberry Balsamic: Not your average Dryers' strawberry ice cream. It has an interesting after taste from the balsamic. -Ricanela: It's basically cinnamon ice cream with pieces of snicker-doodle. It sounds better than it taste... Kind of tasted like cinnamon cereal but frozen(?). I kind of expected more than that but it was just "ehh". -Basil: It's interesting... Taste like pesto in ice cream form? Conclusion: -Try the salted caramel (even if you are not a regular fan of it) -Expect a long line -Expect a very busy and hectic ordering experience

Hit Bi-Rite on a Thursday just before the lunch crowd arrived. Yes! (doing a fist pump) No line... Awesome! Watermelon lime sorbet was sublime! My kids loved it, I loved it! Vegan and tasty.  Light and refreshing on a hot day. Strawberry with Balsamic was delicious. A taste combo that some would balk at, but really shouldn't. Ricanelas with snickerdoodle was the oldest kid's favorite. She barely gave the rest of us a taste.  Deep, multi-layered vanilla and cinnamon flavors. Coffee Toffee,  lots of coffee flavor but not too much toffee flavor. Grab a scoop or two of great ice cream and head over to Dolores Park to bask in the lovely summer sun (if it is out). Be sure to wear your sunscreen though.

Came in on a cold foggy Sunday afternoon, and to my surprise there was still a line around the corner, but it was totally worth it because I was craving for their SALTED CARAMEL ice cream! I've also had the chance to try their other flavors including, the malted vanilla, balsamic strawberry, and the brown sugar. Bi-rite has a variety of rich ice cream flavors, but it's the salted caramel ice cream that brings continues to bring me back to this place!

I waited quite awhile to finally get to try Bi-Rite and boy was it worth it. I arrived Monday afternoon and there was barely a line. I went with the double cone, with three flavors: Ricanelas, Honey Lavender, and Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl. My least favorite was the Ricanelas, reason being I've made something very similar to this at home (http://www.nowyourecook.…), so I should've tried something more adventurous. It was good though! But my favorite was the Honey Lavender. Light and refreshing. The Brown Sugar was great too, but I've never had a floral-y ice cream before so that took the cake!

After hearing about this ice cream shop not only from Yahoo but the Food Network and also my friends, my sister and I made it a mission to try out Bi-Rite during our only day in San Francisco. We went around 9:30pm on a Saturday and the line was ridiculous long! Driving by, it would be hard to miss this ice cream shop. There were tons of people sitting/standing outside enjoying their delicious ice creams The line snaked all the way around the corner (about 50-60 people). Keep in mind, it was at night so it was also only around 65-70F! After 5 minutes of waiting in line and realizing that we were not getting anywhere, my sister noticed that there was a separate line if you want to buy pints of their ice cream instead. The separate line was much much shorter with only 5 people in line! If you happen to know what you want and have a bunch of people to share, this while save you a lot of time. They still offer about 15-20 flavors on their pint menu so it is just as good! Each pint is only 7.99 and they offer a bunch of delicious flavors. I wanted to try more of them but since we only had 5 people, we had their Salted Caramel and their Honey Lavender. Salted Caramel: YOU MUST TRY THIS FLAVOR. The ice cream was really smooth and creamy and it was absolutely delicious! The salt really enhanced the flavor of the caramel. We ended up finishing the pint within a day - that was how good it was. My parents even enjoyed this flavor as well. Honey Lavender: The lavender flavor was a bit too overpowering for me so I preferred the Salted Caramel flavor instead. They did an excellent job in putting the honey and lavender flavors inside the ice cream though because they really stuck out. If you happen to like the taste of lavender, you can try this flavor out. But, because it was an entire pint, it was a bit too much for me. Instead, I would recommend just getting a scoop of this flavor to try first. If you happen to be in San Francisco, you must try Bi-Rite! It will definitely be worth your trip there. The line can get a bit long but if people are willing to wait almost an hour for this ice cream, that is how good it is. Hopefully the next time I visit, I will get the chance to try out some of their other flavors as well.

What more could I possibly add about place?! Yeah... I had no idea either. All you lovely Yelpers pretty much said it all, but if I were to describe how I truly feel about Bi-Rite, it would be contained in this one single photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_…

When a place has a 4.5 average with close to 5,000 reviews, all I have to say is "respect." The line looks long, but at it's worst it's probably 15 - 20 minutes. The flavors are unique and the prices are reasonable. The strawberry balsamic, honey lavender, toasted coconut, roasted banana, sea salt caramel, etc were all very good. I was also impressed that next door, the sea salt caramel soft serve was just as good and the sour cream chocolate cake was tasty too. It ranks as one of the best ice cream places I've been to and when I'm in the area again I'll be back.

Kind of expensive, but definitely worth it.  It's so delicious, and there are so many different flavours for people with all types of palates.  Definitely eclectic.  Chocolate coconut, Lavender, Basil, Salted Caramel, and so many more.  There are also the "regular" flavours, of course.  Definitely cannot pass this place up.  Especially because it's right across the street from Dolores Park, and down the street from Pizzeria Delfina. The ice cream is perfect in every way: rich, creamy, so flavourful and true to the actual foods their based on, and so thick.  BEST.  ICE CREAM.  EVER.

i'm not even big on sweets but i liked so many of the flavors that i had to get three of them... thats saying a lot bc i usually order the smallest size at ice cream shops which typically only lets you get one flavor. i didnt get the beloved salted caramel only bc i ended up trying it after i ordered. but holy cow i totally get what all the buzz is about. i got the honey lavender, coconut chocolate, and the roasted banana. all extremely delicious. i had tried the early grey one too.... oh i so wanted to get that one too but i knew four flavors was overboard... literally all the flavors i tried were sooo goooddd! their only fault... which is pretty much their business gain...they are pretty stingy on the servings. their scoops are pretty puny.... lets be honest....

Went on a Saturday in the early afternoon. Line wasn't too bad and moved relatively fast. Nice, sunny day + ice cream + Delores park = great chill spot or even date. Ice Cream: I like the different options in their sizing (small gets 1 big or 2 small scoops, medium gets 2 big or 3 small scoops). That way if you like a particular thing you can get more of it or if you want to try different things, you're able to. I had a taste of the olive oil ice cream. Surprisingly, it didn't taste like olive oil but had this sweet creamy taste.  I got a small that consisted of the salted caramel and ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles). I wasn't a big fan of the salted caramel but I usually am not big on salted caramel anyhow. I really like the ricanelas though. Overall, if I'm ever in the area again (since I'm living in SoCal), I would defintely come back here again.

I'll join in with everyone else on this one.  We don't get a lot of ice cream weather in this city.  But when we do, aint nuttin better than a couple'a scoops of Bi-Rite.  (A perfect way to end a Dolores Beach sunbathing day.)  And let's be honest, it tastes pretty good on dreary days too. Yes, it's pricey and yes the lines are long, but who cares.  The ice cream is delicious and if you're really in such a hurry for cheap ice cream then you're probably missing the point of ice cream.  Eating ice cream is a special occasion treat reserved for slow-moving, lazy days.  Grab some friends, stand in line, and jabber about the latest movies you've seen.  Stare adoringly at the passerby's, be they yuppie families, sweater-clad dogs, or naked men.  By the time you get to the front, you'll know what flavors you want.  My faves right now: malted vanilla and salted caramel.

There really is nothing that I can say that hasn't already been stated in the THOUSANDS of reviews before me. There is a great reason for the plentiful reviews--Bi-Rite is the best ice cream in existence. Good things - Ricanelas: Hands down, my favorite flavor of all time. Snickerdoodle chunks, cinnamon ice cream that isn't overwhelmingly sweet, and just the right amount of creamy. This flavor goes well with pretty much all the creamy flavors, if you're getting more than one flavor (which I wholeheartedly recommend) :) - Pretty much every other flavor: Ricanelas needed its own separate review to highlight its awesomeness, but I honestly have not had a bad flavor here. Brown sugar ginger caramel swirl, malted vanilla with peanut brittle, toasted coconut...so so so great on so many levels. - Two flavors per "single" scoop: I know that at any other ice cream place outside of this SF foodie haven, $3.50 would be two actual scoops, but you still feel like you're getting a steal here when you can pick two flavors. Just okay - Salted caramel: I know this is THE flavor, the one that's on the 7x7 list, but I think it's too salted. It tastes like an overpowering sensation of burnt caramel, which gets tiring after a few licks. - Bi-Rite cones: You get three options here: sugar cone, gluten-free cake cone, and regular cake cone. None of them do the ice cream justice, so I usually opt for the cup. So Bi-Rite is most definitely worth the long lines and ultimately, if I could have my ice cream dreams fulfilled, it would be to do a Bi-Rite scoop on an Ici waffle cone...

Bi-Rite Creamery is the number 1 place you have to go to if you're anywhere near the mission at night. Fresh and daily made ice cream, the flavors know no bounds. From  your basic vanilla and chocolate, to their unconventionally delicious Earl Grey and Salted Caramel your tastebuds will indebted to you until your next visit. Even on rainy nights, the line before closing is still around the block-if that isn't a sign that they're doing something right, I don't know what is. Parking can be tough in the area, but because their service is quick and easy spots always open up. If you're in a rush, you can "skip" the line outside the door and jump inside and grab a premade pint and purchase it right at the front of the line. Summer in the city may still consist of fog and some cold, but Bi-Rite Creamery will always be a good idea anytime!

Line? What line? There's no line. It's technically more like successions of lines! Ask yourself if you can commit to waiting. Once you've embraced the notion, here's a trick to not let the line get you down: Get the soft serve (or ice cream sandwich) first so you can enjoy it while you wait. On the other hand if you don't want to wait in this ridiculously funny line, then go to the Bi-Rite Market across the street and get the pint. What I like about  Bi-Rite ice cream is their clean fresh subtle taste that lets you eat scoop after scoop after scoop.

We decided to try this place because it's a famous SF establishment. We went on a Wednesday night and there was a line, of course. Ordered the honey lavender and it was really very good. Compared to Mitchells or to Marianne's in Santa Cruz (which I both love), there is a distinct difference in taste and texture to bi-rite. It definitely tastes more natural and not artificial. The texture is not "gummy", if that makes any sense. ANYWHOO... Will be back here soon, I hope.

Yeah, this place is good. So good that the infamous line snakes around the corner even on a 50-degree cold-breeze evening. People are crazy, man, crazy. Like me. I'm not standing in line again though. I thought Ici's line was bad but this is just ridiculous. Why not just zip to the register, swipe that pint out of the freezer, and pluck your credit card down? Boom! No line. Share with your friends, and buy a box of cones if you want. But I guess people like the feeling of accomplishment when they're finally - finally! - handed their cone of honey lavender and olive oil scoops. And yes, I admit, this is some damn good ice cream. There's something else people don't really talk about: the soft-serve. Limited flavors, but barely any line, and on some days they have the famed salted caramel in swirly form. Mmmm... now that's good. Who would have thought that stuff the color of human waste and squeezed out of a machine would be a delight? ...Oh, didn't see you eating that coffee swirl. Sorry for the imagery.

After grabbing a sandwich from Ike's a couple blocks away, Bi-Rite was the happy ending for my lunch. As expected, there was a line out the door and onto the sidewalk. I was with a bunch of friends, so the wait didn't seem too long, maybe 20 min max. I was reading some reviews in line, and I had a hard time deciding which flavors to choose since they all sounded so good. The staff is friendly and they'll let you sample anything you want! I tried a few flavors and settled on salted caramel and brown butter pecan. The salted caramel tasted incredible! Strong flavors and the texture was so creamy and satisfying. I would definitely keep getting this flavor every time. I had high expectations for Bi-Rite ice cream, and they definitely lived up to it. I was so amazed by it that as I was walking and eating, I stepped in dog poop. But I didn't care. I was happy. That's how good it was.

Worth the wait! They have line cues ready for the cult following. You can actually order minis of most of their sundaes. I had the snack box sundae and it was fabulous, but the mini was more than enough! My sister had their coffee ice cream and if you're a coffee addict it definitely has a string flavor.

Don't let the line intimidate you, it's well worth the wait! Good assortment of uncommon flavors - lavender, honey, balsamic strawberry, etc. My personal favorite is Riccanelas. But don't be shy to sample the other flavors before you buy a scoop or two :) It gets a bit crowded but its ok, the ice cream is well worth it.

And this is the story of my first $8 pint of ice cream. I'm eating it as I write this review. Even before I arrived at the creamery I knew what I was going to get: the salted caramel. All these Yelpers love it, so how can I lose? I look at the prices; the price of two cones was almost that of a pint, so why not get the pint of the most popular flavor instead and share it with my friends? That way I get WAY more ice cream! Yay! At the counter I had a few samples of other flavors and was overall pleased with their  options. I then purchased the pint of salted caramel and started on it outside the creamery. Here it comes: the first bite. ACK! I felt like I just got slapped with a bag of sugar. It was way too sweet for my palate, and much sweeter than the other flavors. These Yelpers sure love their sweets. After this experience I pledged to try the flavors before buying them, and I recommend you do the same. The basalmic strawberry and ricanelas are excellent options, and they bring you a more balanced taste experience compared to the salted caramel. tl;dr SALTED CARAMEL MIGHT BE TOO SWEET FOR YOU.

I came here on a beautiful Friday afternoon expecting there to be a line out the door, but it was my lucky day! No line what so ever! The parking here is such a drag. I think you're better off taking public transportation and walking. The staff is really friendly. I love a person who can scoop up my ice cream with a big smile.... Because who in the world frowns in the presence of ice cream??!! I ordered a scoop of salted caramel and a scoop of roasted banana. Both realllyyy good! The salted caramel was a bit more coffee-like than I expected, but it was still really tasty. The roasted banana was perfect! I was feeling very hipster that day, so I took my ice cream over to Dolores Park and enjoyed the sunshine :)

My Ratings: Quantity: 3 - Not a lot for the price Quality: 5 - Very tasty! Price: 3 - Good. Location: 3 - Small Parking: 2 - Street parking Service: 4 - Nice Speed: 4 - Quick Overall: Love their Coffee Toffee!  Will go back again just for that flavor! My Opinion/Story: Bi-rite Creamery delivered such a wonderful blend of different flavors but not a lot that would overwhelm you.  I opted for the Salted Caramel (since this is what Yelpers rave about) and Coffee Toffee.  The Salted Caramel was good but too sweet for me.  The coffee toffee was just perfect with chunks of toffee to add to it.   We waited in line but it went by so fast that we barely noticed the wait. They let you taste any flavor you want to taste.  The portions were small and I would have loved to get more for my buck but I guess that's asking a lot.

I don't live in San Francisco, but I make every effort to come here when I visit the city. All the travelling, every penny, every dollar - TOTALLY WORTH IT.

I live around the corner from the creamery, so I'm fortunate enough to know when to go to avoid the lines: right before lunch, or when it's chilly outside.  You might think that that's not an ideal time for ice cream, but it's still JUST AS TASTY. My fave is the mint chip, but the salted caramel is also out of this world.  Worth waiting in line for.

DEFINITELY worth 5 stars simply for it's honey lavender ice cream!!! I waited for nearly AN HOUR in that ridiculous line.. so when I got to the front my mind-set was "THIS BETTER BE THE BEST DARN ICE CREAM IN THE WORLD!" and it seriously was. The honey lavender is by far the best I've ever had. Even compared to the honey lavender at Gelato Classico, Bi-Rite owns them all. The flavor was so rich, it exploded in my mouth and I was shocked that it was so flavorful. I only wish I got a larger scoop now! My advice? Get the pint in the freezer haha because you're gonna need it!! Oh and also, you can skip the wait in the line if you pick up something already packaged.. good tip for the future!

I've been wanting to check out Bi-Rite Creamery for ages. I'm glad I finally got a chance to come here. Don't think, just make sure you get the salted caramel! It was my favorite flavor by far. It's just such a unique flavor. I also had the mint chip and tried a bite of my husband's coffee. Both were also excellent. If you get a single, they let you pick 2 flavors. If you get a double you can pick 3. This place is pretty small with crappy parking and a line out the door. But it was worth the half an hour wait. I would say this is the best ice cream place in SF!

We went here for dessert last night after dining at House of Prime Rib. We easily found parking on Dolores Street. Luckily for us, the line wasn't too long around 8pm at night. It did get longer and wrapped around to Dolores by the time we left a little after 9. Service was quick, we stayed and hung outside to eat our ice cream. Orange cardamom, Coffee Toffee, Salt Water Caramel, a sundae with bergamot olive oil, all were excellent! I'm definitely coming back to try the other flavors. Mitchell's used to be our go-to place for ice cream in the city. I think we found our new spot!

Holy Bleep Batman!!! This place is so good. I am somewhat lactose intolerant (Ice cream usually leads to my butt screaming), but I would torture myself for this stuff. My travel buddies and I knew that this place had made it to yahoo's top ice cream places in the U.S. and with my husband and sister (two of the top ice cream aficionados in our family), we went there approximately 3 hours after we had gotten into town. I usually feel like I order the perfect thing on the menu, but I was wrong on this day. I thought, let me do vegan ice cream as to not upset the beast that lives in my stomach, and although it was decent (FYI Austin's Lick makes the best vegan ice cream I have ever tasted in case your in this area) I was green with envy when I tasted my husband's and sister's incredible choice. My sister's was a lavender ice cream while my husband's was a vanilla and both were topped with an orange olive oil and sea salt. My hubby's was this sophisticated orange creamsicle which haunted me.  It made my vegan coconut chocolate choice seem like a tragic ice cream scoop falling to the floor. I should have thrown it to the floor and walked back into the ice cream store and ordered what they had. But I didn't. Instead, I hoped that we would go back, but we didn't. Every where I went, every store on our road trip (from San Fran to Seattle) I looked for this elusive orange olive oil in hopes to replicate this dream. I did find the book that has some of their recipes, but not the oil. I did however find a place that sells something similar. See my reviews for more info. If you live in San Fran and never go to Bi-Rite, I believe that you never really lived life.

Tried the following new flavors. Balsamic Strawberry is NOW my second favorite here. It is so fresh and so creamy. But then again, I am a super fan of strawberry ice cream. But don't eat it with the Salted Caramel. Salted Caramel is so rich in taste and flavor, it just overpowers the Balsamic Strawberry. Honey Lavender is really good idea and I had high hopes for this flavor. But I found out, I am not a fan of eating potpourri. Taste is strong and texture is so creamy. But first bites are like eating potpourri. I will pass on this one. Basil is an odd one. It really tastes like basil. But then I get confused because I am eating ice cream and it tastes italian in my mouth. This is another pass, but I give them thumbs up for infusing the herb so strongly into the ice cream. No longer on their list, but peanut butter with fudge. The peanut butter part was so intense, like eating mouthfuls of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. But the fudge was odd. It didn't seem to mix well with the cream. It easily separated from the peanut butter ice cream and had a little bit of a chalky taste. this is no longer on their menu, but I will pass on it also. Ok, so my vote is in. I still LOVE LOVE LOVE Salted Caramel, but I can also take a pint of Balsamic Strawberry for days I don't want to be as guilty.

I FINALLY got to try Bi-Rite after reading about it all of these years.  I have also gone to Humphrey Slocombe that's nearby.  I like Humphrey Slocombe's better for the inventiveness of the flavors which are constantly changing. That said, we got there at 615pm on cloudy/drizzly August Saturday.  Despite it being dinner time, the line was around the corner and took about 45 mins to an hour.  REALLY, FOR ICE CREAM???   Between the 4 of us, we tried the Ricanelas (cinnamon ice cream w crushed Snickerdoodle), Coffee Toffee, Salted Caramel, Roasted Banana, Toasted Caramel, Malty Vanilla and the Ginger Caramel one (forgetting the name).   All were really good, but the banana took over the flavors of other things in the cup (coconut and the ginger caramel), so while it was a nice flavor, only get this if you really like banana or you also have other really strong flavors in your cup.  Otherwise, just get a taste and skip the actual scoop. Tasting: the 2 servers at the counter were really cute and friendly. They probably would have let us try every single thing if we wanted to and didnt rush any one.  This is probably why the line took so long,   A single (1-2 flavors) was $2.50.  The double (2 or 3 flavors) was $3.50.  You can get cones or cups or sundaes. My daughter dropped her cone on the ground so we also tried the Bi Rite soft serve next door.  There was no line and only offered plain boring chocolate or vanilla.  Eh. there's a reason why there's no line for this... Parking is a pain and on the street.  Good luck w that.  =)

Here's what makes a good ice cream: 1) Using FULL cream / Milk (none of that non-fat /low fat stuff - really if you take the fat out, you have to enhance the flavour other ways - which companies usually do by adding extra sugar - or maybe corn syrup since in the US that is added to everything that you buy pre packaged) 2) Using FULL cream / milk as your FIRST ingredient (not sugar, then cream) Hands down one of the best ice creameries in San Francisco.  Smooth, Creamy, Without being too sugary. Just perfect! I come from New Zealand which is the dairy capital in the world. We have good dairy. And this is good ice cream. I brought some visitors from New Zealand for this awesome place and they literally thought they had the best ice cream in their lives. My favourite flavours (I haven't tried all the flavours) - Balsamic Strawberry - I LOVE LOVE it - Salted Caramel - Sweet & Salty - how could you not enjoy it? - Butter Cream Pecan - Oh so smooth~ I tried a taste of malted vanilla (this was really good, but on the sweet side), honey lavender (which a lot of reviewers enjoyed, but I personally thought was a little too flowerly / artificial / strange tasting). Just stick to the above 3, and you are good. Will I come back? Yes even my lactose intolerance will not stop me from eating bi-rite!

The soft-serves here are THE BEST EVER!!! I love soft-serves, so I may be biased. The flavors rotate, but they seem more or less their regular flavors. Love the Mexican chocolate. It's also very reasonably priced, and at the soft-serve window there's usually no lines! Love the soft-serves here! The regular ice cream is, as usual, excellent also, but the lines can be super long. First timers really should try the salted caramel.

Not like this place needs another raving review, but I'm a sucker for ice cream. Salted caramel (obviously) a must, and the honey lavender was really delicious as well. I figured out a great new tactic to semi avoid the line: waltz inside straight to the cashier and buy a pint with 2 spoons. Enjoy outside while the other suckers wait in line for a half hour.

I had the trifecta which includes a scoop of their salted caramel, brown sugar with ginger and caramel swirl, and malted vanilla with peanut brittle and chocolate. O.M.G. Delicious. I couldn't even choose any one flavor that I preferred over the other. The line looked long, but moved quick. I believe it's $2.50 a scoop. They sell cookies, prepackaged containers of ice cream, cupcakes, and other goodies. I downed my bowl of ice cream so fast that I needed to cough, but held it back by shoving more ice cream down my throat because it was the... BEST. ICE. CREAM. I. HAVE. EVER. HAD. No joke. If you're in the bay, Bi-Rite Creamery is a MUST.

Just okay. I do not get the hype. The line went down the street, and I waited about 20 minutes before I could order. I decided on the olive oil and strawberry balsamic. The olive oil was just okay but not too interesting (I don't know what I was expecting I guess, but just something with a bit more pizzazz) and the strawberry balsamic was just regular strawberry but a bit too sour, plus it was not as creamy as the olive oil. I've heard that Bi-Rite is famous for their more creative flavors (where is their caraway orange and cardamom??) but I didn't have these options when I visited, and I don't think that it was worth the wait nor the hype.

My favorite ice cream place in SF!! ALL their flavors are delicious, but some of my favorites are salted caramel (*drools*), white chocolate raspberry (seasonal) and ricanelas. They also have gluten free and vegan sorbets and ice cream if that is your preference. I have tried numerous ice cream places in SF (most are very good), but I seem to always crave this place. There is always a line here, even on freezing cold days, but the staff is very friendly and very efficient so it moves quickly.

If there was any a store that I wish I lived on the same street, it would be this one: Bi-Rite Creamery.  It always has lines out the door, with people waiting with excitement and anticipation, wondering what flavors they are going to get, knowing that they will pick the ones they always have come in for... Located in Mission Dolores, it's adjacent to Dolores Park, which makes it the perfect stop after a hot day laying out on the grass (I also love going to Bi-Rite Market across the street and getting a sandwich and some side salads for a Picnic in the park!) The whole street that it's located on is a veritable food fest, you have Delfina and Pizzeria Delfina where you can get some of the best Italian food in the city, Tartine Bakery and the Dolores Park Cafe-all good food.. The Bi-Rite Creamery also has baked goods which is another storefront next door, I wish we had known earlier, cuz then we would have bought some muffins and pastries for the hotel! The thing that I LOVE about Bi-Rite is that they are local and they make small batches of ice cream that have an intense amount of unique flavors that elevate the definition of Ice Cream. All natural, no more than five ingredients in each batch, who wouldn't love this place!!! My ALL TIME FAVORITE: Salted Caramel, with Ricanella (Spanish Cinnamon) at a close second-which is usually where I stop...But on this occasion  I decided to add one more flavor: the Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl- this was a heavenly combination!  I also enjoy the Honey Lavender, but it's hard to mix it with the others that I like, so it kinda gets left out a lot.... So when in SF, do NOT miss the opportunity to go to Bi-Rite Creamery and get yourself some Ice Cream, you're an idiot if you don't like it....(just kidding....well....not really) Ratings (Out of Five Stars) Food:          5 Ambience:  3.5 Service:      4

I'm not about to crown Bi-Rite Creamery as the best ice cream I've ever had, but it's definitely way, way up there. The ice cream is fresh and made daily and the flavors are definitely unique. I've tried the following flavors: 1. Salted Caramel: Awesome! I'm not usually a fan of caramel, so I really liked that the flavor was had that caramel flavor but was not overbearing. It's by far the most popular flavor here. 2. Roasted Banana: Extremely fragrant...and tastes like, well, a banana. It even has real banana pieces in it. This flavor really stands out. I paired it with the salted caramel on the single cone and boy, did my tastebuds ever thank you. 3. Strawberry Balsamic: It's more strawberry than balsamic, but it's still an interesting combination. You really have to take it slow and savor the flavor to get that subtle balsamic flavor. In essence, I think it was meant to kick the strawberry flavor up a notch. It does the job, but I think I expected something more unique. 4. Honey Lavender: You can definitely taste the lavender in this combo. It's good, but I'm not sure that I would buy a pint of this...but maybe I'm just not a fan of lavender. I would however recommend this flavor to someone who's looking for something on the lighter side though. 5. Creme Fraiche: Think of this flavor as your basic vanilla. It would go great paired with one of Bi-Rite's stronger flavors. 6. Brown Butter Pecan: It's nutty and creamy at the same time. It's another that would go great with a stronger flavor. My mom enjoyed it when paired with the balsamic strawberry. 7. Ricanelas: The cinnamon definitely adds a kick to this flavor. My brother said that it reminded him of a cinnamon roll, but in ice cream form. 8. Coffee Toffee: For all you coffee fiends out there, this is a good coffee ice cream. It's light, but still has that good coffee flavor. The toffee isn't overbearing either. All in all, Bi-Rite is great because it's not very expensive and it's fun to grab a cone and walk over to Dolores Park to just relax, enjoy San Francisco, and eat your ice cream. And if you don't want to wait in line, you can bypass it by walking in and just buying a prepacked pint of your favorite flavor!

Omg. GET RICANELAS, it's the best you won't regret it. cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodle cookie chunks? You better believe it!!! I tried some of their other weird flavors but they weren't nearly as noteworthy as the ricanelas.  I wish I could buy a whole gallon of ricanelas back home, but I think it would melt by the time I reached san jose :( Yadda yadda, parking sucks, so does the line. This is SF, you better get used to it. I walked from the top of dolores park down to try this ice cream and it was worth every step. I was lucky when I went cause there were only a couple people in front of me but when I exited, the line was out the door and almost around the corner! craziness. I like the portion size they give also, just one scoop for $2.50. Perfection in a cup or cone :)

What else can I say that 4,000+ haven't said already? So I'll say it again: Salted Caramel is a must-try for first timers. Not to say that others shouldn't be revisited (or add on another scoop or two?). Honey lavender is also pretty phenomenal. All at a very reasonable price for really good ice cream. If you've also been to a Jeni's, this place definitely gives off a similar vibe. Prepare to wait in line, sometimes wrapping around the corner, if you're here for just a scoop. Otherwise pick up your ice cream to go at the Coop down the street.

UNIQUE FLAVORS! that actually taste good & is not overdoing it. I got the salted caramel which was good but a little too strong and the white chocolate raspberry that wasn't as strong so it was a good balance of those two. 3.5 for two small scoops (2 different flavors) or one big scoop. The wait in line was around 15-20 minutes but worth it. I'm not from NorCal but I really wish SoCal had an ice cream shop that offered such flavors! Parking was really hard to find though. We drove around for 10-15 minutes for street parking.

Life changing.   Growing up, my home has always been stocked with at least one or two cartons of ice cream.  I love ice cream.  I can't imagine a world without it.  Why live in a world without ice cream--why?  It would be a sad world, and I want no part of it.  So whenever I'm in the Mission, I make it a point to stop by Bi-Rite (and then if I have time, Humphry Slocombe).  It always makes my day.  The flavors are phenomenal, and you could really taste the essence of each flavor.  The last time I was here, I had the Balsamic Strawberry, Honey Lavender, and Coffee Toffee.  These are just a few of their AWESOME offerings. Balsamic Strawberry--Wonderful. Coffee Toffee--made with Ritual Coffee.  Ritual Coffee may have some snobby baristas now and then, but I can't say that their coffee sucks.  This was one of the best coffee ice creams I've ever tasted. Honey Lavender--MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE.  You could taste both the Honey and the Lavender, and the flavors don't overpower each other.  It has such a refreshing taste and it smells great, too!  If I remember correctly, the Honey Lavender made me close my eyes for a moment and think about positive things.  It really brought a smile to my face. I really love their other flavors, but if I list them all then this review would never end.  Try it for yourself!

You know this place is popular when the line goes around the corner on a cold and windy night... I'm never super excited about any of the flavors when I'm trying to decide what to get (I like fruit ice cream flavors but they generally only have fruit sorbets) but I always end up enjoying my ice cream a lot anyway :) Recently, I liked the coffee toffee and the white chocolate raspberry. Toffee in the coffee toffee was soft and not impossible to chew... I also liked that it didn't stick to my teeth. White chocolate raspberry was not overly sweet (like white chocolate usually is) and the raspberry added a bit of tartness to it. Yum!

Insane lines out the door, but it does go by pretty fast and people who want ice cream are typically pretty friendly. ;) Only downfall about this place is that its in San Francisco and i now live in L.A.!!!!

What a cute little place (no really, the seats were tiny) full of unique flavors!  We walked from the BART, desperately hoping there was no line so we wouldn't miss a reservation later.  Luckily, there was nobody in line!  I had the balsamic strawberry and malted vanilla.  I really really liked the balsamic strawberry.  The ice cream was really creamy, and the strawberry flavor was really different from other strawberry flavors I had.  It wasn't just sweet, it had a bit of tangy-ness that I can't quite describe.  The malted vanilla wasn't what I expected, it was too sweet, and didn't taste like malt at all.  I guess what I like about malt vanilla is how plain the taste is, and that wasn't quite what it was. I also love the ricanela!  I got that from a pint (not as fresh, but no line when there's a crowd!) and really enjoyed it.  Tastes just like a snicker doodle.  Some other flavors were just too sweet.  I guess it's a hit or miss with what you personally like.  Fortunately, ice cream places often let you try out flavors before you actually get a scoop, so try away!  Overall very satisfied with certain flavors and the creaminess of the ice cream.

I would say Bi-Rite is probably my favorite ice cream joint in the city, followed by Humphry's and Mitchell's, why? Bi-Rite has the winning combo, toasted coconut + banana on a cone, makes the worst day the best day! Price wise, Bi-Rite is higher than most ice cream joints. Parking around the area is very tough and the line is usually around the block on warmer days. My suggestion is to come here early or on a colder day, otherwise you'll end up circling around the block for parking, followed by a 30-minutes wait in line.

Food: 2 Decor: n/a Service: n/a Dropped my gf off here to get us some ice cream and drove around for nearly 30 min looking for a parking spot nearby. Ended up not finding a spot and just picking her up as soon as she got her ice cream. We got the olive oil and strawberry balsamic in a cup, and both were rather disappointing. Olive oil was very subtle, as was the balsamic, but I really didn't care for either.

One of the best icecream places ever! Long line though, but the wait is worth it. I recommend roasted banana!! So rich, creamy, and refreshing. Mmmm. I have dreams about this particular flavor.  The others I've tried: Balsamic Strawberry - I really like this one! Would definitely get this again.   Salted Caramel - overly sweet and too rich for me. I don't have a sweet tooth, so maybe that's why. Chocolate Coconut - as a lover of coconut, I can say this is amazing!! Perfect blend of the two flavors.   Coffee Toffee - you wont be disappointed coffee lovers! Cookies and Cream - nothing extraordinary, tastes like stuff I've had before. If you're not sure of what to get, take advantage of the free samples!

The first time I tried Bi-Rite Creamery... a friend from out of town, was told by his attending that THIS was the place to go to for ice cream or for a birthday cake.... so when I showed up to a dinner party we tried the: Chocolate salted caramel cake! Omg... Heaven! I think everyone fought over who would get or share the last bits of it. the 20 of us destroyed this cake. lol. the second time, we had a gf in town and we were walking about the mission district and decided to wait in the loooooong line to try some of this ice cream goodness in person. Salted caramel cone. yummy! i think this is my new fave flavor! Tried the balsamic strawberry ice cream... interesting. good... but a bit weird. and there's a trick to the line! if you want a pint of ice cream and not a scoop... go to the front! you don't have to wait! But if you're gonna try and be sneaky and get a scoop in.. go wait in line. don't be THAT guy. I got a pint of Earl grey ice cream... one of my gf loves this one.. i tried it, at first i liked it. i figured my bf would like it but that was a negative. after a few tries, I had to throw it out. too weird. but definitely an awesome place to go to on a bright sunny summer day!

Bi-Rite has quite a reputation for dishing out some of the best ice creams in all the Americas, the long line out the door that snakes around the building is more than enough to prove it!  Long as the line may be, that very first taste is more than enough to make up for the 30 precious minutes of waiting in that beast of a queue! They advertise that (almost) everything they sell is handmade from scratch with local ingredients in small batches, from their signature ice creams to the the peanut brittle, marshmallows and hot fudge they put into/on their ice creams.  Having sampled several of their ice cream flavors, it's safe to say that it's not just a hype!  They have some pretty unique ice cream flavors - basil, balsamic strawberry, olive oil (made with their very own line of olive oil), honey lavender, ricanelas (cinnamon with snicker doodle), roasted banana, brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl, coffee toffee - to name a few.  But the flavor that stands out the most was definitely their signature salted caramel!  Yum! In the end, the boyfriend and I decided to share a simple banana split, the caramelized banana was the selling factor for the both of us.  A half banana split into two was caramelized (via torching) to form a hard crispy shell that supported two generous mounds of vanilla ice cream which was further topped with swirls of ooey gooey hot fudge, plenty of toasted walnuts and a healthy dollop of homemade whipped cream!  With that, they just doubled the yum factor!  The vanilla ice cream, simple as it may seem, was made with real, quality cream as well as real, visible vanilla beans!  I'm a real sucker when it comes to quality vanilla bean ice cream.  :) Bi-Rite is a very small storefront with just three small tables for "dining-in", but why sit inside when you can enjoy your ice cream across the street at beautiful Dolores Park?!?!  While you're at it, grab yourself a frequent buyer card (buy 10 get the next free), having tried it once, you'll most likely be back for more!  ;)  But if you're not in the mood for a full on sundae or the combo of flavors, you can skip the lines and go straight for the prepackaged pints of the same ice cream, or you get get in the much shorter line for their soft serve next door.   Oh, and I love the fact that Bi-Rite uses all compostable utensils and promotes recycling to the fullest!  Thank you, Bi-Rite, for doing your part to save our planet and for the mind blowing flavors!  ;)

Holy crap. So after what seems like years of people recommending this place to me as one of the best places in the city to get ice cream, I finally got the chance to come by and give it a shot! And boy, people are definitely not wrong about this place. It's actually not a far walk from the BART station at 18th... Which I highly recommend you use instead of trying to drive there because it is definitely a car nightmare in that area. It is amazing! Ok well the line is not amazing... Cause there apparently seems to be 30 people lining up on any given day/time (it was like 9 pm when my friend and I got there and it was cold and people were still lining up for ice cream...). We were in line for about 20 or 30 minutes? But it was definitely worth it. There are a ton of interesting options. And they all look incredibly tasty. We settled on getting the single (which are two large scoops or three smaller scoops) and got four different flavors. You can try the different flavors if you ask too. My friend got Ricanelas and cookies and cream while I got balsamic strawberry and honey lavender. I was actually really looking forward to trying their earl grey tea flavor, but I guess that was a seasonal flavor :( The counter was crazy busy, and the girls seemed to mess up a couple of the orders (for other people) but they worked quickly and replaced the orders they messed up. The girl who gave me mine made sure I had two very large scoops too, which was super cool. The ice cream is pretty expensive, but considering the fact that the ice cream is made daily (they have a full kitchen in the back), it's totally worth it! The ice cream is rich and creamy, with the right amount of fluff mixed in. The balsamic strawberry had a very interesting sour cream taste to it; it was nothing like any strawberry ice cream I've ever had. The honey lavender grows on you a lot (it's not something I'd usually think of getting, but I loved the subtle taste. The cookies and cream ice cream is hands down probably the best cookies and cream I've ever had with a perfect texture and taste (I love the cookie bits!). The Ricanelas was probably my favorite of the bunch with the cinnamon and the cakes bits... It tasted exactly like the cereal cinnamon toast crunch! Also reminiscent of the Frozen Kuhsterd I had a while back at the Yelp event, which is also good but didn't have the depth in texture like this ice cream. The ice cream was so amazing that I bought a pint home. Which almost ended in disaster because we were BARTing home and driving all the way back Mountain View. Lesson learned though: make sure you have an ice cream evacuation plan before buying! Yay Ricanelas!

They live up to the hype, no doubt. This place is so good, it has lines longer than a night club, however, the wait is worth it! Salted Caramel is definitely one of my favorites, but i also love mixing strawberry balsamic (you HAVE to try it, don't get weirded out by the combo) and honey lavender. The prices for a cone/cup aren't outrageous, either. It's just creamy, buttery, ice cream goodness! Tip: If you just want to nosh on a pint all to yourself, jump the line and run to the fridge that has a whole array of their concoctions all prepackaged :)

If you go and see that the line for ice cream is too long (it usually is) go for the frozen yogurt on the side.  It's not quite as good, but it'll still usually satisfy my sweet tooth.  They've got 2 flavors each day as well as a sundae-like mix.  They also have cupcakes and other treats.The ice cream's really what this place is known for though, and I really love it, I just can't stand the huge line you need to wait in to get it usually. Also, this place is literally across from Dolores Park, so it's a pretty nice place to get some ice cream from before taking a walk around the park and enjoying SF. Delicious ice cream, but huge lines, so maybe try the frozen yogurt's shorter line.

I came here a couple of times with my friends and i have always left with a happy tummy. I first came here because i heard a lot of hype about this being the best ice cream creamery in town. So i wanted to see what it was about and show some of my out of town friends the place. When we first arrived there was a semi-ling line out the door and i like how there were those movie theater ropes to keep the customers in check. However, the line moves fast so it wasn't too long of a wait and in the cold SF weather that is the greatest thing that can happen for you at a popular place like this. The people behind the counter were all super nice a friendly and always encouraged you to try a sample before getting an ice cream. Don't know about real spoons, instead of the small plastic ones that you can throw away, they give out as sample sticks but the ice cream is good to it massed my germ-a-phobia. My friend got the salted caramel (cuz it is oh so popular) and i got the lavender honey with earl grey. Oh my! was mine the bomb-diggady! I am a big fan of the florally, light ice cream and mine had the perfect balance of flavors. It had notes of lavender and creamy without being too heavy or over powering. If you haven't had earl grey the taste might surprise you and  be a little weird, but a good weird. These two ice cream are definitely my go to and favorites! What happen to the salted caramel, you wonder, well i had some off my friend and it just tasted like coffee or espresso ice cream, good, but nothing i have already tried before. Bottom line: it is a great place to take your out of towner friends to for some really good ice cream. Very high quality ingredients, and at a rasonable price.

This review is based on Bi-rite's Salted Caramel ice cream because that's all that matters. THE best salted caramel ice cream I've had was in Oregon two years back from an ice cream cart; name I can't remember. I've been lusting...no FIENDING for Salted Caramel ice cream since then. I've tried countless grocery store renditions to no avail. I heard that Bi-rite served their own concoction of this frozen crack so I definitely had to try it. It's fucking good. And just as good as the one I had in Oregon. Oh yea, the lines are ridiculously long. Stood in line for a good half hour in the brisk night air for this stuff. If you ain't want scoops and just want a pint to go, then just cut up front and grab the Salted Caramel (don't even think about getting anything else) from the freezer and get the fuck outta there to enjoy your new creamy narcotic.

THE BEST BEST BEST SALTED CARAMEL... omg.. creamgasmic... truly something to drive across the country for... first off.. you have to find road parking like everywhere else in SF.. the line COULD get quite long BUT it moves pretty quickly compared to Ici in Berkeley.. I can NOT stop talking about their salted caramel.. SO GOOD!! i have also had their white chocolate raspberry and roasted banana.. i don't think i would get their roasted banana again because I am not a HUGE fan of banana.. but all of their ice cream is true to flavor.. you can order one scoop, or for the same price get two smaller scoops of two flavors.. or if you want to scoops you can get two regular size scoops but for the same price you can get three smaller scoops of different flavors!!! HOW AMAZING AND SMART IS THAT!! love it.. Their packaged cookies are ALSO FANTASTIC.. come here for a great experience and premium ice cream.. you will NOT leave unhappy (as long as you get their salted caramel haha)..

Good stuff!  It's a classic establishment, and worth visiting if you haven't already, but the competition is catching up.  Salted caramel is the new black, apparently. Then there was that one day when I bought out all their fruit popsicles, because it was a hot day and they were delicious.

I don't get the hype about this place... came here on a SF foodie adventure and stopped by Bi-Rite and Humphrey Slocombe for ice cream. After looking up yelp reviews, I went with the roasted banana and balsamic strawberry ice cream. And to be honest, the flavors aren't anything spectacular. I tasted no balsamic in the strawberry and think it's all placebo. Yes, the roasted banana tastes like banana, but it's only "unique" because no one ever flavors ice cream like banana! So... taste wasn't anything spectacular. What about texture / creaminess? It was again nothing out of the ordinary. In fact, I think the creamy / melty ratio that I personally like is much better achieved by store-bought ice cream like Dreyer's. For gourmet ice cream, I much rather prefer Ici (in Berkeley) for both flavor and texture, and Humphrey Slocombe for it's eclectic flavors. A note on the service though, they are phenomenal! We came in a party of 7 and they let us try all different kinds of flavors and were very patient with us. It just so happened that the store was completely empty at that time, then like 20 people came in all of a sudden. So take the above with a grain of salt because it wasn't busy at the time.

Roasted banana flavor is what you need to try!  Mitchell's is still better, but I guess one upside of Bi-Rite is that it's in relative walking distance from BART (as opposed to the location of Mitchell's).

One star deducted for the no-fail LONG ASS LINE that always awaits you at Bi-Rite Creamery. Yes, their ice cream is good but you shouldn't have to wait 45 minutes for it. That being said, their ice cream is wonderful! I've tried the Salted Caramel, Balsamic Strawberry, Honey Lavender, and one of their seasonal sorbets. All were delicious, although I have to say I think I might like Salted Caramel the least (contrary to it being the crowd favorite). The staff is awesome in that they'll let you sample any and as many flavors as you'd like despite how long the line is (although it's probably the reason for the line...) and it's pretty affordable. If you're interested in just buying pints, you can bypass the line and go straight to the front. I don't remember how much their pints are but I feel like they're more bang for your buck than a regular scoop so if you have a group, I'd probably go that option. There's also a market halfway down the block that sells various goodies and treats. My advice is to grab a cup or cone to go and then head to Dolores Park which is right across the street if it's a nice day! However, being as this IS San Francisco, you might be better off grabbing it and walking to the nearest bus/BART station to avoid the rain.

Aside from the horrendous line (45 minutes!) and the Yes on 37 people hounding each person in the line, this place is great.  But I don't think I'd wait in that kind of line again for the ice cream.  The roasted banana, toasted coconut and honey lavender were delicious.  Service is pretty good - everyone is friendly.  This place is right next to Dolores Park and gets a lot of foot traffic.

We arrived to find a really long line. There happened to be a soft serve line which was much shorter. Ordered the pint of salted caramel which was Delish! After consuming half the pint (sodium intake quota for the week being fulfilled) we gifted the rest to the last person in the longer line. :) Three stars because the ice cream, while tasty, wasn't mind blowing enough to warrant a return visit.

HALLELUJAH ! I finally found a super duper good ice cream place ! I love how they have unique flavors compared to other ice cream places. Although they are a bit pricey for a small amount , but it's all worth it. My favorites are the earl grey (limited time), lemon, and many others ! The texture of the ice cream is really different than a lot of other places and you can really taste the quality in it. Too bad sometimes it's hard to find parking around this area , but the ice cream here are worthy of praise !

*** I'm a week behind on my reviews so I'm dropping the Bay area reviews first before the Yelp Vegas Spring Break ones. *** This review is for the soft-serve as I didn't want my company to wait in the ridiculously long line with me. Personally, I would have done it since I was already in the area. We got on the soft serve line instead. Pretty pricey compared to regular soft serve but the taste and texture makes up for the price different. This is definitely not your average ice cream in a cone. I'm gonna have to keep this in my bookmark and try it the next time I'm around here.

The food: There are ice cream shops galore in the bay area, but Bi rite stands out amongst them. Go to Ici for the gourmet, Humphrey Slocombe for the weird, but Bi rite for just good, down home, unique and tasty treats. My personal favorites are the strawberry balsamic, burnt caramel, or chocolate but they do a decent honey lavender and other tastes as well. Foodtv has featured their Sam's sundae, which is something to try for the daring. The good: Bi rite is reliable for pretty excellent ice cream. It has more of a homemade feel with the hearty flavors, but it's still gourmand enough to be truly worth each scoop. The bad: Where Bi rite excels in its tasty homemade-ness is also it's downfall; if you're looking for a gourmet experience, head to Ici's on the east bay. But that's not to hate- I still love it here! Ambiance: friendly servers who generously offer samples, but only a few crammed in booths; you'll end up eating your ice cream on the go or on the street- or maybe head across to the park to enjoy! Very neighborhood ice cream shop. What to know: sample before you buy! Don't be afraid to try things that are different, like the olive oil drizzled Sam's sundae or basalmic strawberry. Good for: comfort food moments, friends and family In short: Bi rite is the neighborhood ice cream shop elevated a few notches to excellence.

The lines can get insane on the weekend, but most recently we went on a monday midday and there wasn't a line.  Bi-Rite was a perfect spot after hanging out in Mission Dolores park. Bi-Rite really sets itself apart with the more complex flavors (not just the fruity ones or chocolate or vanilla) - the salted caramel is perfect and is the one must-have flavor.....it's not too sweet with a deliciously subtle burnt caramel and slightly salty flavor.  We also got a coffee toffee one, which wasn't too sweet and good too. Bi-Rite is the best ice cream in San Francisco, without a doubt.

After being a fan of Molly Moon's in Seattle, I was really excited to try this place. I have to say that it is even better than MM's (maybe it's the custard base? mmmm, eggs!). And whatever they did to their coffee toffee? So addictive! I don't even like toffee, but for some reason, this mix was amazing and I want to get their cookbook and make it for myself since I'm nowhere near Bi-Rite to be able to go and stock up each week. The line is a little long, but not too bad. It moves quickly and it gives you a chance to think about what you want. They are a little frazzled in there with so many people all day, but still nice. Loved it! I wish there were more places to eat inside, but I understand it's a tiny place, so no stars removed for that. Maybe you can expand to Washington?

After laying out at Dolores Park, ice cream sounded delicious. Enter Bi-Rite Creamery! There was a line out the door but it moved quickly. I sampled the banana and the cinnamon cookie one which were both good. I ended up getting a scoop of salted caramel and a scoop of coffee toffee. Salted caramel was ok but I didn't like the flavor of the caramel. It was more a super butter toffee flavor and it wasn't particularly salty. I wouldn't get it again. The coffee toffee was delicious though! the toffee is homemade and on the soft side. Some of the best toffee I've had to date. Coffee ice cream was a nice strong coffee flavor as well. This should be a definite stop if you're in the area.

I thought this place was too hyped up when I first came here... but after multiple visits, I really really like this place! The great quality ice cream here spoiled my taste buds... so now I'm picky about my ice cream. My opinion on some flavors: Salted caramel = too sweet for my taste Roasted banana = pretty good! but nothing super special Balsamic strawberry = not as good as everyone says it is... I prefer regular strawberry ice cream anywhere else Ricanelas = it is cinnamon ice cream with snicker-doodle chunks. THIS IS THE BEST FLAVOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!­!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GET THIS ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!­!!! Cookies and cream = pretty good! but you can get cookies and cream anywhere else... so that's why you have to get ricanelas!! Honey lavender = I don't know why people like this flavor in general. I don't really like it... Expect a line!! And eat your ice cream at the very top of Dolores Park (if you can resist finishing your ice cream before getting to the top)!!!

The most popular flavor was salted caramel.  I tasted that and honestly it's not that good... I ended up getting cookies and cream (typical flavor that i could get at the market).   One thing they need to change:  don't dip the scooper in super hot water.  i know that its easier to scoop but right when i stepped foot out the door my ice cream was literally dripping on my hand.  Crossed the street and it was a mess!! It was not a hot day too so it was not the sun! Luckily I went during a weekday and there was only a few people in front. I would not wait in the regular 30-1hr line to experience this again.

I discovered recently that a few acquaintances of mine had somehow resided in San Francisco without ever trying Bi-Rite. "The line is too long", they said. "You can get ice cream like, anywhere", they said. To which I respond, I pity you. I'm not religious per se, but I do try to do good works and help other people in the hopes that when I die, I will go to heaven, and heaven will have Bi-Rite. My personal favorites are roasted banana, salted caramel, brown sugar, and honey lavender, often in some combination. However, I have never tasted an ice cream there that I didn't like (except peanut butter, but I'm allergic to peanuts so that's not their fault). So yes, okay, there tends to be a line to the end of the block, but isn't that usually an indication of deliciousness? Call me a sheep, but if 30+ people are standing in line to eat something, I want to eat it too. Besides, the line moves fast and is an excellent time to contemplate what wonderful flavor you want to treat yourself to today. Also, let's discuss location. Bi-Rite Creamery is conveniently situated at the corner of Dolores Park which, if it happens to be a nice day out, is an ideal place to enjoy your ice cream. Plus, Bi-Rite has a (clean!) bathroom which they're super-nice about customers using. So on a nice day when I'm hanging out with friends in Dolores Park, I'll use their bathroom AND get ice cream - double whammy! I just realized that a) this is a super-long review and b) the time I just spent writing this review could have been used to get Bi-Rite. Peace.

I've only been here twice. The first time, I was quite intoxicated and don't really remember what flavors I got but what I DO remember is that it was delicious. The second time I went (yesterday), I was completely sober and the experience again, was DELICIOUS. Very short line when we arrived. I sampled the banana mango sorbet and immediately knew that I needed more of it in my mouth. Got a single of the balsamic strawberry (creamy and fresh) and of course the banana mango sorbet (both fruits shone through quite well and both complemented each other to the fullest) I want Bi-Rite now.

Our first time here, but I've heard so many good things about this place (by my fam and friends, and from food TV), I didn't even mind waiting in that long ass line! It took about 30 minutes, but the weather was perfect and there was lots of people watching to be had, so it was all good. The place was claustrophobic small, but everyone behind the counter were super friendly. Huge crowds of people are of course nothing new to them. I picked up a bag of oatmeal apricot coconut cookies before I stepped up to order my ice cream. I tasted the ricanelas (very good), but I already knew I was getting a double scoop of salted caramel, toasted coconut, and roasted banana on a cake cone. OMG. Pure wonderfulness. We parked a ways away (parking is a biatch), and my cone was devoured by the time we got back to the car. They sell their flavors by the pint or quart, and if that's all you're getting, you don't have to wait in line for those. Score! Shoulda brought an ice chest...next time I'll be ready!

Creamy and unique flavors of ice cream! The service is great, although it was crowded, the workers patiently wait for you to decide after you try about 2 flavors of ice cream. I tried Olive Oil and Balsamic Strawberry, and then ended up going for Honey Lavender. The Olive oil didn't really have much of a taste and the Balsamic strawberry tasted to me like strawberry. Honey lavender was good!  It had a flower-ly taste. I definitely recommend at least trying that flavor! I love that this ice cream store has interesting and creative flavors that were made from hand, not like baskin robbins or cold stone.

Lady Luck smiled down on me one Saturday afternoon when I spontaneously decided to try Bi-Rite Creamery for the first time. OK, I was actually going to Dolores Park anyway to meet a friend, but whatever. I have a weakness for frozen desserts and hadn't had a scoop of rich, creamy, homemade ice-cream in weeks. My boyfriend was reluctant to join me and warned me repeatedly that I should prepare to wait at least 30-40 min. Ha! Nuts to him! :P There wasn't a single soul in the store. I literally skipped and danced my way up to the counter (I get a little loopy when I'm sugar-deprived), much to the amusement of the manager. With no other customers breathing down my neck, I was able to sample every flavor that intrigued me, and Bi-Rite--being one of those non-soulless corporate ice-cream chains--had the kinds of unique flavors I love: subtle, mildly sweet and naturally derived from either flowers, spices or herbs. (To give you an idea of what I mean, my favorite ice-cream flavors include saffron, olive oil, earl grey and basil. I know--I sound like a pretentious hippie.) The honey lavender was sweet but lacking in substantial lavender flavor. The olive oil had the right amount of EVOO flavor but was not quite sweet enough to me. The balsamic strawberry was tasty but probably not something I'd ever buy. The creme fraiche was wonderful--a little tart, very creamy and just the right amount of sweetness. And finally, the white chocolate raspberry (boyfriend's pick) was very rich and very decadent, perfect for people who don't do "hippie" flavors. I ended up buying a scoop of the basil ice-cream. It was so incredibly fragrant and delicious, as well as a gorgeous light green color. My boyfriend, who is always skeptical of my "hippie" flavors (despite the many times he's tried them and liked them), raised an eyebrow when I told him he should taste the basil. "That can't possibly be good," he proclaimed. Two seconds later, he was not only eating the basil, he was eating his words. If you have a palate like mine, I'd highly recommend either the basil or the creme fraiche. They are without a doubt my favorite Bi-Rite flavors and some of the best ice-cream I've ever had, period. The basil is only available in the summertime, but you can buy pints of the creme fraiche all year round. I bought one last week and finished the entire thing in half an hour. Yeah....I might have a problem...... TIP: If you find Bi-Rite too packed to sit down and enjoy your ice-cream, have no fear. Dolores Park is just a couple of blocks south and there are lots of seating options there.

Wow, I think San Francisco likes standing on lines. We waited in line on a Sunday evening for about 15mins before getting into the store. The ice cream was really yummy but 15 minute wait for ice cream? I'm sure there are times its even longer since there was another set of stanchions behind us that was ready for the next wave of patrons. Anyway, back to the ice cream. I got the Coffee Toffee, Salted Carmel and Vanilla on a waffle cone which came out to $5.00. The scoops were generous and they don't seem to mind letting you try flavors. There is also another window for ordering soft serve and other desserts and drinks-- no line for that. I was impressed with all their interesting flavor so I'm sure the next time I'm in SF I'll be back on that line again.

Salted Caramel is the winner. Waited so long to try the ice cream but it was worth the wait. There are a couple of benches around so you can sit around and eat while you socialize. Tried the salted caramel, cinnamon something (starts with an R), and toasted banana. All were delish. Parking is poop... DONT GET CONFUSED BETWEEN THE YOGURT PLACE VS THE ICE CREAM PLACE. I prefer ice cream so there are two areas. So far this is my favorite ice cream place.

I am not quite sure what the big hype is all about. The Bi-rite ice cream was A-Ok. I had the toffe ice cream and I did not feel like it is 4-5 stars worthy. It tasted pretty ordinary and did not tickle my fancy. I definitely had something better elsewhere. Luckily there was not any line the time I went there because I would be very unhappy to wait in long line for something mediocre.

On every trip to San Fran, my sister is always kind enough to take me out for ice cream.  I gave up dairy over 6 months ago by choice, but made an exception for this trip.   We must have lucked out, cause the line to order ice cream, really wasn't that bad for a Friday summer evening.  I had the rhubarb strawberry sorbet (I know, this doesn't seem like much of an exception).  My hubby ordered the strawberry basalmic ice cream and salted caramel ice cream.  I had a chance to try both of these as well and they were pretty yummy.  I can only imagine, that if I lived in San Fran, this place could become dangerous to me.  I can't wait for the next trip up.

Yay to best ice cream sf! Homemade so good! Near Dolores park and 24 and mission Bart station. "For a cool, creamy batch crafted from scratch, look no further than Bi-Rite Creamery & Bakeshop, a San Francisco landmark set in the heart of the Mission District. Aside from its signature creamy scoops, Bi-Rite boasts a versatile selection of delicacies, ranging from ice cream sandwiches to popsicles to fully loaded sundaes. To top it off, owners Anne Walker and Kris Hoogerhyde pride themselves on making all the toppings -- including marshmallows, peanut brittle, and hot fudge -- at their adjoining bakery. For intense flavor, try their "dainty gentleman" signature sundae (honey-lavender ice cream lathered in hot fudge, sea salt, and blood orange olive oil)."

With almost 5000 reviews, i'm sure this place does not need another one but I am in LOVE with this place. this place has by far the best ice-cream I have ever had. On the weekends it is usually packed, so be prepared to wait in line for at-least 30 minutes, but believe me its worth the wait. The best thing to do around here - get a scoop or two, and go soak in the sun at Delores Park! (on the days that it is actually sunny here in San Francisco!)

Typical pricing, kinda small portions, friendly service. SUPER LONG line, but very organized about it. They were still taking customers past their closing time. BROWN SUGAR ginger caramel swirl - so delicious, just a deep sweet (but not overly so) that you know comes only from brown sugar. The best brown sugar ice cream I've had so far (some are kind of gritty and taste like actual sugar, but this one is nice and smooth) COFFEE TOFFEE - potent coffee flavor that is well balanced with the sweet toffee chunks. Both flavors go well together also! Tasted my friend's picks - TOASTED COCONUT - is not so much refreshing as just toasted earthy, so it's not a fruity pick if you're expecting that. MALTED VANILLA peanut brittle and milk chocolate - is interesting, peanut flavor permeates even if you don't get a piece of the brittle, didn't taste any of the chocolate.

Sooo freaking confused! Hubby dropped me off so he could find parking. At first I stopped by the market and they directed me to the end of the block. Then I stopped by the soft serve window and they told me if I wanted ice cream to go down a little further. Finally I made it to the creamery...only to find a long ass line. Geez! So we wait in line for 30 mins. We get to the front and I see a sign that says if you want to buy prepacked ice cream you can go straight to the cashier, no need to wait in line. Really! Geez...so we decided to get ice cream and eat it right away to make it worth the long wait. Flavors: Salted caramel: 5/5 no wonder this place is known for this flavor, super tasty! We bought a pint to go. Brown sugar: 5/5 amazing taste. Pumpkin: 5/5 omg even more amazing! soooo yummy! Not super sweet either. Malted vanilla: 3/5 I am not a big fan of peanut butter, and I think I tasted some bit and pieces of pb. All in all it was a long wait, but this place serves some legit ice cream!

The ice cream is not worth the line, but the soft serve is great and the line is always short. Even when the ice cream line is 100 people deep, the soft serve line has maybe 10 people. All the refreshment and none of the atrocious wait.

SOOOOOO GOOD! I don't eat ice cream that often but I've heard about Bi-Rite for so long that I had to try it. My friends and I stopped in after The Color Run SF on a Saturday morning and there was no wait. :) We got a small cup with salted caramel and the fruit sorbet. The fruit sorbet is usually a seasonal so I think we got the watermelon? Sounds like a weird mixture (and it was!) but my boyfriend is lactose intolerant so he tries to limit his ice cream consumption so it worked out fairly well. I really liked both of them! The salted caramel wasn't too sweet and the sorbet tasted really fresh. The small cup ($3.50) was perfect for the two of us who aren't huge ice cream eaters. Can't wait to go back to Bi-Rite to try the other flavors! I also really liked the people that worked there. The girl that helped us was patient and friendly while we tried the different flavors.

I was totally excited to go try the salted caramel after hearing about it. Got to say, I was a disappointed. It tasted kind of like burnt caramel and the taste kind of stuck to the back of my throat. Wasn't that impressed with this flavor. And it melted too fast, so by the time I got to it, it was all melted. However, the balsamic strawberry was amazing! I loved it! It was really creamy and I could taste the strawberries more than the balsamic.

I once stood in line here for 45 minutes and refused to move under any circumstance just so I could get roasted banana ice cream. (No, the lines aren't always that long. But yes, I will gladly do this again, any time, in any weather.) Even my dad who hates ice cream thought this place rocks.

Balsamic strawberry+ salted caramel = heavenly. The line is seriously out the door and around the corner on weekends, pretty much no matter what time of day. Weekday afternoons are good times to go if you're impatiently craving some amazing ice cream. My music teacher was holding a song creation challenge and announced that the prize was a $15 Bi-Rite gift card. Well, let's just say I immediately had the greatest creation spark in my musical career thinking about ice cream. I won the challenge, thanks to my incredible motivation, and spent about $5 on my first visit. Which means I can go 2 more times to get my favorite flavors for free!! (although I will continue to support Bi-Rite with my own $$) :D ++ The workers here are super friendly and I love that they have vegan options! - Everything is recyclable or compostable. The location is also another plus, right next to Dolores Park!

One day, I swear, I will try the olive oil sundae. Today, thanks to the appearance on the menu of balsamic strawberry and creme fraiche, was not that day. Both flavors were amazing, and complex, and well worth the $3.50 I paid for it, I have to be honest. My kid brother got to try the salted caramel, and I'm pretty sure he said something like mmmm nom nom. It was better than I remembered it, so yeah, I'm feeling like it's popular for a reason.

Living in Berkeley, I'd always hear people comparing Ici to Bi-Rite. I'm still not sure which one I like more. Bi-Rite is still definitely up there in excellent ice cream regardless of any comparisons. Last time I went there, I had the salted caramel and roasted banana, both of which were fantastic. People talk a lot about the salted caramel, but the banana, for me, was the standout. Something about it just brought out the voice in the back of my mind shouting, "I want more!" Doesn't hurt that location-wise, it's right across the street from Dolores Park, so you can enjoy your ice cream on a "good" day. How long the line is depends on how lucky you are when you go. The first time I passed it, I did not even bother waiting in the long line. But during my most recent visit, there were literally two people in line and that was in the middle of a really sunny day surprisingly.

I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE Bi-Rite Ice Cream! What I don't love is how you have to wait 20-30 minutes to order, but once you get there it seems that you are rushed rushed rushed. There is also a problem that I never know what i want to get. Recently I've resorted to just going for dinner and getting a scoop of everything. Salty caramel, good for the first bite, but I think it's way to sweet to enjoy thoroughly. Fattie & yummy! TIP: definitely buy the pints to take him if you're already there and waiting.

This place is my all time favorite ice cream place. Every time I'm in sf I make a stop here. It's worth the drive, it's worth the line, it's worth it!!! Salted Caramel: a MUST try. It's freaking unbelievable. Brown Sugar w. Ginger Swirl: SO good. i had a double scoop along with the salted caramel & it matched really well together. Honey Lavender: perfectly sweet & floral, so refreshing. I love it! This is a MUST go whenever you're in SF.

Ever since my brother told me about Molly Moon's in Seattle, my SO and I have been more keen on trying out local ice cream places. So, while in San Francisco, we decided to try out Bi-Rite Creamery. I was already a fan of the market since the last time we were in the city I got this awesome curry toffee. Anyway, that's another review. We arrived at the Creamery on a sunny, but cool Saturday afternoon. Seems like we weren't the only ones who thought ice cream sounded like a good idea. The line had three distinct waiting areas that wrapped around the corner. Should we wait? we thought. Yeah, if everyone else is waiting too, it must be worthwhile. So, we waited. We took turns using the restroom (which had its own line), and we eventually got to the front of the line. A fair line made it less stressful - not sure this would work in Miami (where I'm from). My SO made the right move and got the flavor combination listed as a "staff favorite" - malted vanilla, salted caramel, and brown sugar. I got brown sugar, creme fraiche, and ginger. My favorite was her malted vanilla. She was nice enough to share;) I tried a few flavors before ordering, but I didn't want to hold up the line, so I didn't try them all. I tried the balsamic strawberry and the salted caramel. Neither was a hit for me, but some people swear by the salted caramel. I prefer flavors with "stuff" in it, which is why I really liked the malted vanilla. In any case, no matter what flavors you get, this is a fun experience.

Quick tip - Come here on cold days to avoid line lines. Been here plenty of times and the salted caramel is by far the best flavor they have. What is double bladed sword is they have unique flavors only. If you are craving traditional flavors i recommend Mitchels down the street. Bi-Rite is great for ice cream if you looking for something out of the ordinary. I rarely crave flavors like lavender or olive oil. I do feel that the first time i tasted these flavors they have similar taste just different after taste. Just a thought.

My first experience with probably will make me biased to like it, but I think it still says something about the place! I was having a really bad day and after looking at 10 different places for a short snack (not having craved any of it), I finally decided to stop here. I picked out a kid's cone of Cheesecake ice cream and the guy asked me how my day was. After honestly answering that it was pretty bad, he said that my ice cream was on the house. Totally made my day much better. =] Regardless of that experience, I've seen lines out the door even on cold winter evenings, and I understand why. There isn't much seating on the inside, though understandable for an ice cream place. The place is conveniently near some good restaurants and has good ice cream that they make themselves. The flavors aren't the type you could buy by the carton (recommend honey lavender yum!). Of course, the people working are pretty nice too. The only thing is that I wish it was a little cheaper, but that's true about most things I get.

There were only 2 people in line when I drove past this place looking for parking but after 2 times around the block, the line grew to over 20 people. Ridiculous. If it's one thing I've learned about going to these kinds of great ice cream establishments... never get the plain flavors such as "vanilla". It's a waste of an experience (and gas since parking is crazy). We ordered the salted caramel and coffee toffee ice cream and they were delicious. The texture was soft and melts as soon as it hits your tongue, not a moment too soon or too late. These flavors are what make authentic creameries awesome. I just wish there were more places to sit, more places to park, and that waiting in line in the cold (for ice cream ironically) wouldn't be so unbearable.

I am more of a cake/cupcake/candy bar/chocolates type of dessert fiend.  In fact i never have ice cream in my freezer so ice cream is not something i usually crave.  But when I'm in the mission, I always make a pit stop at Bi-Rite even if the line goes around the corner.  The ice cream I've tried here is so good!  Very creamy!  Totally worth the wait!!  And while I usually gravitate towards chocolate flavors, at Bi-Rite I don't because their flavors are out of this world! My top 3 flavors are: 1) salted caramel - believe the hype! 2) roasted banana - just when I thought banana ice cream couldn't get any better... 3) toasted coconut - yum! And when the weather is nice, cross the street and enjoy your ice cream at Dolores Park.

Took me 2 failed attempts before finally getting to experience this local fav. The first two times the line was around the corner, one of those times being late on a Monday. As we drove away disappointed, I told my boyfriend it did not make sense to me why so many people would wait in a line that long on a cold night for ice cream. I guess third time is a charm though. We were met with surprising success on a Friday night when the line was shorter. We had a ricanelas and white chocolate with raspberry. I was tempted to get honey lavendar too, but I had had the flavor at another shop in a different city and was told it was very similar. Both flavors were good and I look forward to trying others in the future. The experience was a bit too hectic for me to rate it higher. Crowds are common so I guess I should have expected being rushed to order. It's just sad that it took away from the experience. There wasn't even a chance to look at the whole menu (I didn't even realize they had soft serve until now). The interior space was tiny and because of the crowd I felt guilty sitting down for too long eating and chatting. Bi-Rite has good ice cream, sure, but it's just ice cream (and hardly worth a 30+ minute wait). Hopefully my next experience will be better. EDIT: I have since been back 2 more times and also tried the soft serve. I still think it's overhyped. :P

What to say, this place always has a line of people! I had a gift card for the longest time (over a year) and decided to use it. I came here and tasted/ ordered the following: Balsamic Strawberry: WEIRD! Tasted weird just think of strawberry ice cream with a balsamic vinegar... tastes exactly like that. Honey Lavender: Very flowery. If you like the taste of flowers and fragrant types of taste this one is for you. Toasted Coconut: MmmMMm YUMMY!! Loved the toasted coconut! Not that rich, but rich enough to enjoy the scoop I got! It was very very creamy and it was just soo good. Roasted Almond: If you are Asian or love Asian food, this one reminds me of the almond jello dessert my mom used to make when I was a kid. It has chunks of almond in it that made it even better! $3.75 for two small scoops of ice cream. I ended up getting Toasted coconut and Roasted almond. Ice creams here are very thick and creamy, not like other ice creams you get at the local market. It is more rich and creamier. Service was really good and the place is busy, but the line goes by really fast. If you can't wait, just get the pint they have in the freezer, no need to wait in line! I still have $$ left on my gift card, so I definitely will be back!

In my continuing quest for the best vanilla ice cream on the west coast, Sweet Rose's Creamery in Brentwood/Santa Monica still wins out. Bi-Rite was good, creamy, dense, ice cream, with some interesting flavors, but overall, I wasn't blown away as I had hoped to be.  They do get major points for having cinnamon ice cream, one of my favorite flavors of all time. It was 10:30 in the morning, so there was no line, but I was glad that I didn't get there later--there's ropes already set up for the lines!

Oh yes. Bi-Rite does ice cream....right! I'm lucky that I have a really amazing ice cream place pretty similar to Bi-Rite here in the Detroit burbs (Treat Dreams, whuuuttt) and (no tea no shade) I don't have to wait over 30 minutes to get a scoop there. So when I showed up I was pretty surprised to see such a line around the block. But we were there so we decided to wait. The line moved pretty quickly, I'll give them that. I decided to go with the salted caramel and roasted banana--both of which were fantastic. HUGE fan. Great variety of flavors too. I could have easily gone with anything from that list and likely been happy. Nice servers, quick service, and a great selection of toppings (although I went naked this time around to enjoy the ice cream as is). So yeah, while the ice cream is a 5 star taste experience I can't help but dock a star for the wait. Not their fault, of course, but it's hard to really psyche yourself up for that long of a wait when you know you've got something just as delish and unique at home. But if you don't have something like this around you it's definitely a must visit and a must wait!

I adore this place because the long lines are worth waiting in to get to the ice cream goodness that Bi-Rite Creamery offers. You can sample flavors you haven't tried and still order your usual. Recommended flavors: balsamic strawberry, salted caramel, and honey lavender. Best enjoyed on a hot day with good friends.

Do I even need to write a another 5 star review for this place? Yes, because of my contribution, here it is: A scoop of Ricanellas (sweet cream cinnamon ice cream with CHUNKS of snickerdoodle), a scoop of ROASTED BANANA ice cream, salted caramel sauce drizzled on top. Done and done. I have had ice cream all over the world - South of France, Germany, Paris, Amsterdam, Philly, NYC, that place in Berkeley everyone loves but I think is lousy, I think it's called Ici. BiRite, BY FAR, the best ice cream in the entire world. If you're not feeling Ricanelas and banana, you can't go wrong with the Ritual coffee ice cream with toffee in it. When I grow up, I am going to marry Bi-Rite.

You can't go wrong with any of their ice cream flavors. My favorites are Salted Caramel, Honey Lavender, Ricanelas, and Balsamic Strawberry. The line gets longer and longer every time we come here, but it moves fairly quickly. If you just want to get a pint to share or to go, you can bypass the line, go straight inside, and grab a pint from the fridge and pay for it. The Bi-Rite soft serve next door usually doesn't have an insane line.

When I told my friends I've never been to Bi-Rite, their reaction was always a shocked one.  And now I know why!  The amount of unique flavors is astounding, and tasting them is even more astounding!!  I had the creme fraiche, honey lavender and balsamic strawberry.  I had them on a cone and so I got a bit of each flavor which was.. well.. remember that scene fro Ratatouille when Remy is enjoying a piece of cheese and a grape?  Well, that's what it tasted like. Be prepared to wait in line.. If you're eating in the Mission area, go to Bi-Rite after your meal because you'll be ready for dessert once your at the counter.

Cookie Monster!  How can I not order a combo named after the lovable character from Sesame Street?  It includes the classic cookies and cream, which is creamy and just what I think of when I think of this flavor.  It also has the flavor 'ricanelas', which is cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodles.  My hubby went with the 'trifecta', which is a combo of the following flavors: salted caramel, brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl, and malted vanilla with peanut brittle and chocolate.  Pretty good flavors, but I didn't go crazy for any of them.  I'm not an expert on judging ice cream, but this was solid ice cream that satisfied my craving.

It was my second time here overall (totally forgot what I ordered the first time since it was so long ago). For this visit, I purchased a double size (2 large scoops or 3 mini scoops). I choose 3 mini scoops. 1 scoop of the following flavors: SALTED CARAMEL, CREME FRAICHE, and HONEY LAVENDER. I chose SALTED CARAMEL since so many on the Yelp reviews have raved about it. In the end, I blamed myself for not trying a spoon sample first. I'm not sure if it was just that batch for that particular day or if it was really suppose to taste like that, but the flavor I tasted out of the SALTED CARAMEL scoop was burnt caramel. It just tasted like burnt ice-cream (oxymoron, I know) like how if you're trying to boil honey or sugar and you leave it on the stove too long and it gets burnt. To confirm my tastebuds, I had my cousin try it as well and she agreed, it tasted like the caramel portion was burned when they were making the ice-cream. Probably won't get this flavor again. The CREME FRAICHE was a nice touch. It definitely tasted like CREME FRAICHE. I probably won't try it again, but it was nice to try at least once (it was one of the limited flavors of the day). Finally, the scoop I loved the most out of my batch was HONEY LAVENDER. In my opinion, this was the scoop that most lived up to its name. Every bite tasted like lavender petals in my mouth, sweet lavender petals. It was a very light, relaxing flavor. There would be pockets of honey flavor every now and then which was pretty neat. I wouldn't getting the HONEY LAVENDER again. All in all, I've tasted better ice-cream for sure, but BiRite does offer some unique flavors you can't find elsewhere. Note: At specific parts of the day, there are long, long lines. The lines do move quickly though, so be patient. Also, the seating area inside is very limited and small.

Bi Rite is the matrimony of cheap and satisfying that inspires a mass of followers as shown through their carefully roped line extending around the block. For new Bi Rite followers, fear not, the line does move quickly, and soon enough, you'll be paying for your "out of this world" ice cream. (However, please take a look at the menu and narrow down your choices beforehand, as the staff is a bit impatient and would like to limit your tastings (sucks I know). I am not an ice-creamaholic but this place has me addicted. The honey lavender has just the right amount of thickness/ creaminess, and tasted very fresh like it was made with real lavender. Please don't report me when I say this, but their ice cream is orgasmic. I would show you a picture of it, but Yelp is PG13. Don't believe me? Come try the best meal/dessert I had while visiting SF for yourself, lucky bast*rd,

The line really does wrap around the block and for good reason! This place is damn good. I tend to get the salted caramel at a lot of ice cream places, but Bi-Rite does it soooo much better. My friend chose the coffee toffee and it was so freaking delicious. Definitely stop by here and get some ice cream if you haven't already. It will blow you away, I promise.

Some of the best ice cream I've ever had. I tried the Salted Caramel and the Malted Vanilla with Toffee Bits and both were amazing. Incredibly creamy ice cream and also extremely flavorful. I think this and Mitchell's are neck and neck for best ice cream in the city. I was lucky enough to be on vacation and able to go at a random time in the middle of the week so there were no lines, which made the experience even more delightful. This place is at a perfect location too, for a nice stroll with your ice cream through Dolores park. I wish I didn't just eat a massive sandwich from nearby Ike's Place before coming - otherwise, I would've definitely gotten Sam's Sundae too.

As noted, plenty of reviews here and most seem to love this place.  I would add myself to that group as well after my first visit here the other night. Charming little shop slinging delicious ice cream.  There is so much variety here.  I'm sure you can peruse the gallery here to see all of the wonderful things.  I can't remember them all.  I can tell you that I made my own sundae with salted caramel and toasted coconut ice creams, toasted almonds, hot fudge, and whipped cream.  Extremely decadent but very delicious and nostalgic as well.  Takes me back to being a kid and making my own enormous sundaes as a kid. I have seen and been told that there can be a bit of a line here, but when we went on a Friday evening there wasn't too much of a line to speak of.  We were able to get in and order fairly quickly and sit down inside.  Will be back for ice cream whenever I am nearby.

In my opinion, kindddddd of overrated and not worth the wait. I mean, don't get me wrong, the ice cream here is pretty good and they have some bomb flavors. But would I wait 30 minutes + for ice cream again? Probably not. My bf and I came here on a Saturday afternoon and the line was out the door, monitored by dividers, around the corner, and down the street. We pretty much had to wait...for the longest time I've waited for ice cream. When we got to the front, they were super cool and let us try all the flavors we wanted. One unique thing was that they used metal spoons instead of plastic ones to let us try flavors, yay for the environment! I ended up getting the salted caramel and brown sugar with ginger. It's cool cuz you can choose your size based on if you one big scoop or two small scoops of two flavors for the same price! The salted caramel we pretty good and the brown sugar with ginger was slightly odd but I liked it! You can definitely taste the ginger. I tried their honey lavender as well and it definitely has a unique floral taste to it. This ice cream shop also sells other baked goods and their own packaged ice cream as well. You can either sit in the small tables inside the store (really cramped) or outside. Since this place is really close to Dolores Park (literally down the street), my bf and I opted to avoid feeling claustrophobic in the store and sit at Dolores to eat our ice cream. Overall, not worth the wait. Worth a try if there isn't a line, but whether or not you want to wait 30 min+ for ice cream on a more busy day depends on how desperate your body is craving those sweet carbs! Oh, and best part? Definitely one of the most AFFORDABLE ice cream shops in SF!

You'd be UBER CRAY CRAY for missing out on this! After trying their salty caramel, I will never view ice cream the same way ever again. It'll be pretty sad knowing that every subsequent scoop of ice cream that I eat from here on out, will never match up to the quality and the deliciousness of the ice cream served here. And look out for their seasonal flavors. Definitely looking forward to the Earl Grey during the winter! So what are you waiting for??!!? Goo! :)

There is nothing as comforting as the produce aisle of a gourmet supermarket. Unless it is a pint of their own churned small-batch production of Salted Caramel ice cream across the way. also, Their original vanilla goes great either affogato style with a morning espresso, or as an after dinner treat with a decadent drizzle of Chambord. Skip the dreaded line.. Get a pint.

I am glad I didn't miss Bi-Rite ice cream in trendy Mission. Waiting long in line under the intense California sun did exhaust me a bit. But anyway, I was soon cheered by the flavorful ice cream. I ordered honey lavender and balsamic strawberry which flavors that I can hardly find in my favorite ice cream places in Boston and New York.

We like to think of ourselves as ice cream fanatics, so we typically seek out the best each destination has to offer - so we highly anticipated Bi-Rite. Yes, the line was crazy long - but that did not affect our rating. Bottom line for us - don't believe the hype.  I tried the Salted Caramel, Brown Sugar Caramel, and Toasted Coconut.  Salted Caramel was completely underwhelming, and dominated everything else on the cone (so maybe a poor combination of flavors on my part) - but I did try to sample each one on its own.  Toasted Coconut was the best of the three for me.  The cone was mediocre at best. My wife also had the Salted Caramel, and the Roasted Banana, and was also largely disappointed.

Let's play the "Only in SF would you.." game: Only in SF would you find a line of 15 people outside of an ice-cream shop after the sun has gone down and the temperature dropped to about 52 degrees. Salted caramel is the BEST combination of flavors anyone has come up with in a dessert, and I'm thankful that Bi-Rite has served them well. Their staff, although clearly busy all night (and probably all day) was incredibly friendly and put up with my internal debate over just getting a whole-lotta salted caramel or to take advantage of the two half-scoop deal and try another. Thank you for being you, Bi-Rite.

I think the best thing about my trip to Bi-rite was the fact that I beat the line! I got my scoops, turned around to face a line that wrapped around the corner. What a win! My victory wasn't without some scrapes. I still had to stand in line behind some people who wanted to taste five different flavors. REALLY? -_- Salted caramel was on point. It tasted like Salted Caramel. A definite must get if you're all about that flavor. I didn't think it was bad. I'm all about the Roasted Banana. The ice cream didn't have that gross artificial banana after taste. It was the perfect amount of sweet, creamy and delightful. I felt that the "Roasted" part is just a naming convention or something because I didn't taste much of the "Roasted" in the flavor. The flavor profile was just "Banana". I give it a solid 3 stars for the ice cream. I liked it.

O.M.G. Velvet heaven.  I was lucky enough to attend a party where this was the featured dessert and anything with "gourmet ice cream shop" attached to it makes me melt anyway, but wow... I went back for 3rds. Yes, 3 times even after I inhaled dinner. The salted caramel, WOW! Perfect blend of sweet and salty. The toasted coconut wasn't the best, maybe I was just overwhelmed with the amazingness of the salted caramel. Either way the texture, quality and flavor of all were great! Def stop here if you are in the area, even if you are not hungry, you will be once you set your tastebuds in action here.

Yummy in my tummy! 6 years later I make my 2nd visit to Bi-Rite and have their infamous salted caramel. It was delicious. It's so rich and dense and solid. The way ice cream was meant to be made and eaten. The line is longer and more intricately segmented than the hottest club in SF, but it moves quickly and service is efficient and friendly. Just please don't hold up the line by trying every flavor! We all want to get our ice cream on ;)

After reading all the hype about this place on here I tried this place with great expectations. Luckily there was no line when my boyfriend and I arrived and the service was very nice. I didn't like the salted caramel flavor at all, too salty! I did enjoy the mint chip and white chocolate & raspberry though. Oreo was just ok. The ice cream was still great compared to store bought brands, but not mind- blowing amazing.

This place has the best ice cream! And I don't even like ice cream. Every time I have a chance to go to SF I have to stop by this place to get a cup of their ice cream. There is always a line, but it's definitely worth the wait. Their favors are unique, such as the popular salted caramel, plus they have additional seasonal flavors such as basil. My favorite is the honey lavender and the balsamic strawberry. Yes they are interesting combination. Get the single and pick two difference flavors. You can also try samples as well. But I love the place, wait is worth it.

A line wrapped around the block is typical... all day, everyday. Bi-Rite is a staple of San Francisco. Check it out so you can have your own opinion, too! I really only get strawberry (anywhere, even yogurt spots) but I felt extra daring this past weekend... so I got some roasted banana, too! You can get TWO flavors for the price of "one scoop" --- they really just give you two small scoops of each flavor. Cost - $3.50. Pretty fair, I suppose, provided you also get a waffle cone! Head to Dolores Park with your yummy ice cream to be extra hipster and trendy.

I know everyone says it but I have to do it: SALTED CARAMEL ICE CREAM!! delicious! I've been here twice. The first time it was a beautiful day in the city so everyone wanted ice cream. the line was about an hour and a half so by the time i got up there, i so desperately wanted ice cream I would have eaten it from any store. I got the salted caramel along with the honey lavender and brownie bites. The salted caramel is very strong and the honey lavender has such a subtle sweetness mixed with the lovely herb of lavender so the combination was great. the honey lavender cyt through the salted caramel Recently, my husband and I went back on a day where the sun was not shining and there was no line for bi rite. We walked right in and ordered. my husband got the salted caramel, vegan coconut chocolate and white chocolate raspberry(all yummy). I went for the salted caramel with basil. You may think that is a crazy combination but I LOVED it. the basil ice cream really tasted like basil. I feel like I really got to appreciate the salted caramel more and enjoyed it just on it own. Believe me, it is strong and if you are not used to a salty dessert then I would recommend getting a hot fudge sauce or another ice cream to compliment it. on a side note: they have an olive oil ice cream that is also yummy I also have to point out that the customer service is great! They are happy and want you to try as many flavors as you want so that you enjoy your cold treat. I am not an ice cream person but this was very good and I can't wait to go back!

ICE CREAM SENT FROM THE HEAVENS RICH FLAVORS, ORGANIC INGREDIENTS What's better than satisfying your ice cream craving at the best ice cream store in san francisco while supporting your neighborhood business? Nothing. It's perfect. Okay, maybe bi-rite isn't the suitable for some people.. but it is FOR MOST PEOPLE. As stated by everyone - most popular flavor - salted caramel - rich, creamy, perfect I absolutely love their coffee toffee and malted vanilla. There are really long lines during certain times of the day, but it really is worth the wait.

Went last week on a recommendation that it was a famous ice-creamery in SF mission. There were many interesting flavors of ice cream. They let you sample before ordering. You get 2 fair size scoops for about $3.50, which is cheaper than at Ice's in Berkeley. It was pretty good, but it's good to sample the one you want. I did not sample the one I selected, and did not care that much for the Lavender flavor. The other one's I tried were good. After we got ours and stood outside to eat it, a long line started forming. If I am in the neighborhood again, I will try another flavor. That's the thing about their rotating flavors, is that it keeps you coming back! Oh and right next door or so, they have a 2nd bi-rite that sells soft ice-cream. How cool!

And you know the tastes you remember are GOOOOD :P Roasted Banana.....ehhh okk not something to rave about Balsamic Strawberry....DELICIOUS!!!!! A MUST GET FLAVOR! Coffee Toffee....YUMMY!!! coffee flavor with that crunch of toffee. My new favorite flavor from them. The other flavors on the list didn't really cry out to me. lol I like to stick with flavors I love. And Bi-Rite Creamery puts a good twist to my favorite flavors :)

When you see a line outside the door, you know it is a great place. Extremely fast line. Ordered the trifecta but swapped malted vanilla for the roasted banana. The roasted banana was delicious my favorite of the three flavors. Great taste of banana and nice creaminess. Brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl was my next favorite. Not so sweet but just right, the ginger caramel swirl adds a nice unique flavor to the brown sugar. My least favorite was the salted caramel. It was so STRONG. The flavor was too pungent for my pallet and it was really hard to finish the salted caramel. Well, I haven't had anything like that before; it definitely was different. It almost tasted like burnt sugar. Bi-rite has unique flavors and I'm loving the ones I tried except for the salted caramel. I wanted to try the honey lavender but I was sugared out. -The stars tell you..its a must visit. p.s.: service is great. Really friendly.

I heard a lot of good things about this place. A group of us went to the creamery during a Friday night and of course the line was long. So instead of going inside to order our ice cream, we went to the outside stand. I had the Peanut Butter Brittle Ice Cream Sandwich. It was good, but it was such a huge portion that I couldn't finish it.

Run, don't walk, to this delicious ice cream haven. (Really, I do suggest getting there on foot or by bus, because parking in the immediate area is hard to come by). Had the Salted Caramel, Brown Sugar and Coffee Toffee flavors, and sampled my friends' offerings which included Honey Lavender, Ricanelas and Malted Vanilla. Across the board,  the flavors were rich, extremely flavorful and true to the advertising. My favorite flavor was a tie between the oft-touted Salted Caramel and the Ricanelas. Crunchy bits of salted caramel cookie and caramel swirled in? Chunks of snickerdoodle cookies in cinnamon? Yes, please. Prices were good for the serving sizes and service is quick and friendly. Definitely a great place to stop by after dinner with a date or friends, or even just to treat yourself!

First Impressions: 2.5/5. CHRIST, this place is hard to park for and having Dolores Park nearby doesn't help. (Another friend of mine says his default approach when visiting is taking the Muni over instead) The crazy line broken up into 4 long sections to allow better pedestrian flow was the biggest in-your-face sign that screamed this. Luckily, I came with a few determined locals, so they weren't deterred at all. I, on the other hand, almost got carsick from all the aggressive parking space hunting. Ice cream places never really look impressive either (I do like Ici though :X), so I was aware to be on standby till I actually got my ice cream. Ice Cream Flavors Honey Lavender: 2/5. I adore Ici's formula, so I was excited to try BiRite's, but all of my local SF friends were right. Bi-Rite's isn't as tasty. Good to know though. They did mention that they use organic dried lavender and honey from Sonoma, but maybe the flavor extraction isn't at its best... just my humble opinion. Balsamic Strawberry: 3.5/5. I'm almost more in love with the idea of mixing the two flavors and name vs the actual taste of it, but not bad! I'd order it again as my go-to fruity flavor. RICANELES: 4.5/5. My month-long craving for snicker-doodle cookies probably bumped up the rating half a point more, but wow... I also agree w/ other Yelpers that this may be the best flavor they serve. It's the main reason I give this place a 4/5 stars. Random: Another reason I approve of this place is that they use metal tasting spoons to reduce waste, biodegradable cups & spoons when serving, and even make their sugar cones from organic ingredients. Who doesn't appreciate an environmentally conscious business? I certainly do. And how cool is it that their Coffee Toffee ice cream is made from Ritual's coffee? Brilliant. Overall: 3/5 for everything else, but 4/5 just for practically perfecting the Ricaneles experience. I almost gave up visiting because of our bad luck w/ parking, but as an encouragement to other newcomers- hang in there.

During our grandmother's 90th birthday extravaganza, this spot was our go-to for dessert... practically all of my family members are avid ice cream lovers, the bay area cousins, directed us here... From what the cousins were telling me, I knew this was a popular spot, and as we pulled up, we all saw just how popular! The line wrapped around the store, AND around the corner, at least half a block down... due to some quick thinking from one of my genius family members, we opted to ditch the lines, and buy a scooper for 5 bucks, and 8 or so different pints/quarts of flavors to feed the 40 peeps waiting for us on our party bus! Thus cutting the wait time by 90%: we were in and out of the store within 15 mins! on the menu: salted caramel toffee coffee chocolate roasted banana vanilla ricanellas Everything we had was excellent... and pleased all the 40 or so palettes that we were pressured to please.... would definitely return and add to my must visit again list, next time we are in SF!!! So glad to hear that they are opening up a second location!

I sampled the salted caramel AND had a scoop of it with the almond fudge swirl. The entire experience wasn't as transcending as I had hoped (I was in desperate need of some gastronomical inspiration that day - hence I sought out bi-rite in the first place). The salted caramel had a robust flavor that was enjoyable, but somehow the saltiness and sweetness of the ice cream didn't come together harmoniously. The ice cream was thick in texture, but not necessarily creamy. I sound very critical if only because of the reputation that bi-rite has established. The almond fudge swirl was not distinctly "almondy" per say after the first bite, but give the ice cream some time to melt on your tongue and you can smell the almonds. It was like eating vanilla ice cream with an almond after-smell. Thank you to the man who took our order at the counter! His warm greeting made the entire experience worth while. I'd come back for more bi-rite, but I'd opt for other flavors. It seems like there're other note worthy flavors to try!

We had a friend in from out of town and wanted to show him the best of SF, so we paid an after dinner visit to Bi-Rite.  It's easy to be a pig here, but thankfully I can eat off my wife's cup for a taste of some of the other flavors!  I ordered the creme fraiche and the malted vanilla and my wife ordered the malted vanilla and balsamic strawberry.   The creme fraice was good, like a creamier vanilla.  The balsamic strawberry was very tasty as well, not as sour as I had anticipated since I was having visions of balsamic salad dressing.  But the real star for me was the malted vanilla.  Rich vanilla and malt, nicely accented with bits of chocolate and peanut brittle!  Wonderful!  It's a good thing that I don't live too close, or I might be coming all the time!  Definitely worth the wait!

Question: Why is there always a long line at ice cream places?! Well, the answer is that the place is so darn good. If there's a long line, you know that you're at one of the best creamery in San Francisco. With that being said, Bi-Rite is definitely one of the best ice cream places I've ever been to. The flavors were rich and creamy just like how ice cream should be. Don't expect any crazy flavors at Bi-Rite because it's mostly original flavors (that are extremely good). I only got a single cone because I had a big dinner but let me tell you, you'll definitely get your $3.50 worth. (+) Salted Caramel. You really can't go wrong with this. Salted caramel is REALLY GOOD. Extremely rich and creamy with the perfect salty and sweet taste (: (+) Roasted Banana. Pair Salted Caramel up with Roasted Banana and I swear it's the best combination ever. It's like a banana split! (:  You can definitely taste the banana and it even stands out against salted caramel. DEFINITELY COME HERE IF YOU'RE IN SF. However, I'm not a fan of waiting in line. We came around 8pm so the line was about 10 minutes. I don't think waiting in line for anything over an hour is worth it. Go to another ice cream place and come back when the line isn't as bad!

I try to make an effort to stop by Bi-Rite when I'm in the Mission. It's wonderfully located, right by Dolores Park. There's usually always a line, especially on nice days, but it doesn't move too slowly. The ice cream here is delicious - very creamy and rich. There's a few tables inside to sit at, if you wish to sit inside. The flavors here tend to be fairly generic, and nothing too unique (or maybe Humphrey's has just spoiled me). My favorite flavors would be sea salt caramel and the ricanelas. Not much else to say since it seems to have all been said already.

I come here quite often now and still like coming here. The flavors do seem inconsistent though but I don't mind that much. I like their wide array of flavors and different combinations. Salted Caramel (Their most famous flavor) is 3.5 Early Grey - 4.5 Honey Lavender - 4.0 Roasted Banana - 3.0 The place is pretty small but it's an ice cream shop so it's reasonable. There is a long line almost every time I've been there so expect a wait and make sure you get enough to fill you so you don't have to get back in line!

I am embarrassed to say as a native San Franciscan, I've never heard about Bi-Rite until sometime in 2010 or 2011, when a co-worker introduced the place to me. What is wrong with me?! We had this party once and she went across the city just to buy two quarts of ice cream. This place has one of the best ice cream ever because their flavors are different from you usual boring and typical flavors so it's something new and fun for me. Since then I just had to find where the shop was and realized it was just around the corner from where some relatives lived in the Mission. On my first visit, there was a long line so that definitely meant that they had to be good, right? What left an impression with me was the balsamic strawberry so I had to get that but my other favorite was the salted caramel. I think we also tried the coffee toffee but it was alright. Every so often I visit their website for new flavors and bought several pints to bring home. It's a little pricey but I think it's pretty worth it!

As I ate my way through the artisanal ice cream parlours of the Pacific Northwest, I couldn't help wondering: have I outgrown ice cream? Nobody had the right intensity of flavour; the right kind of cone; most importantly, the right level of butterfatty richness. Perhaps I had aged out of ice cream love, lost to the memories of a perfect ice cream that never was. Struggling through this existential crisis, a single beacon kept my hope alive: Bi-Rite Creamery. I had memories of a sublime salted caramel, perfectly balanced and delightfully rich. Would it still pass muster? Or would even Bi-Rite leave me disappointed, and mark the end of my ice cream-loving years? Ice cream eaters of California, Bi-Rite restored my faith in ice cream. Its texture is beyond perfection -- so rich, so smooth, so perfectly balanced between firmly scoopable and meltably yielding. Its flavour palate embraces the novelty and local focus that are popular amongst artisanal scoop shops, while still recognizing that many of us enjoy an ice cream that features actual dessert-type flavours. Its sugar cones are crunchy, its line-ups move briskly, and its servers are exceptionally courteous. Bi-Rite, you are the gold standard against which all other ice cream shops will be measured...and in truth, all found wanting. But it's good to know that I can have ice cream I adore, any time I want to hop on a plane to San Francisco.

Oww, yeah, it's all about the Salted Caramel ice cream. All other flavors pale in comparison. Next time you get it, note the super soft consistency due to the high sugar content...  it can't even freeze right :)   I love the fact that you can pay $3.50 for a single but get two flavors, which translates to 2 slightly smaller scoops. That's customer service!

This place was good the first 10+ times I went, but it's starting to get boring. They need to bring back the better flavors like Basil or Olive Oil, but what they have is still good though. Everytime I'm here, the line extends around the corner, but I always wait even if it's 40 degrees outside and I shouldn't be eating ice cream. I already spent 20 minutes looking for parking, what's another 20 minutes in line?... Favorite flavors here are the Salted Caramel (it tastes alot like their Coffee Toffee one...so if you feel like going real crazy, switch it up once in a while lol), Basil (it sounds weird, but it's the BEST), Olive Oil (it's like a lighter version of Basil), and Honey Lavender. Brown Sugar and Ricanelas are good too, but Balsamic Strawberry is boring.

Ice cream is one of my FAVORITE foods but as one of the unlucky ones (lactaid intolerant, ugh) I really need to ration when and what dairy I can have. If I'm really craving it, I come here. Their salted caramel is unbelievable. I've also had their soft serve (couldn't wait in the long line).

It was raining today and I still went to Bi- Rite. This was a must visit for me. I've been told to go here many times from all my friends. They have a lot of flavors you won't find anywhere else. The place always has a line. This place has the most reviews on YELP. It's a small ice cream spot with great service. You can sample all the flavors before deciding. I knew what I wanted and went for the salted caramel and mint chip ice cream. The mint chip you can never go wrong with. The salted caramel is the popular one here. It's screaming sweetness! The bold caramel taste was wonderful. I've never had anything taste like this before. The creaminess in the ice cream is nice and smooth. The handmade ice cream here is worth it. I bet the summer lines here are insane. If you haven't been to Bi-rite, you're definitely missing out. Recommendation: Salted caramel

Bi Rite kicks ass for all the obvious reasons listed by other yelpers on here. They make awesome artisan ice cream, especially a killer salted caramel ice cream, their sundae toppings are delicious and fun, etc. But today is my birthday, and the ice cream shop in the East bay, where I live, that was suppose to make my birthday cake for today (Sketch ice Cream) called this morning to say their power was shut off last night, so my cake died. They were sorry, but could do nothing for me but return my money and wish me luck. My husband called around to several of my favorite ice cream places in SF, like Humphrey Slocombe, Mr. & Mrs. Miscellaneous, and of course, Bi Rite. Bi Rite saved the day and my party by hooking me up with a ready made kick-ass ice cream cake, malted vanilla with peanut brittle and chocolate. Thank you, Bi Rite, for excelling in customer service and saving my birthday. You have a fan for life.

Dear Bi-Rite, I've wanted to visit you since I've seen you on Food Network. Which ice cream shop is it? The one with line snaking down the block (even at 11pm at night). Who lets you taste ice cream with metal spoons? Only you, environmentally friendly shops on the West Coast. Who is ridiculous enough to put fruity olive oil with maldon salt and chocolate? You are! Who is silly enough to think that sounds delectable? I am! Which ice cream shop has smooth pine tables on the side, and bench style seating, whose staff lets you shout as loud as you want, chat for hours and to let you slobber ice cream on yourself and get it all over your friends? Bi-Rite! Yes- Sam's sundae was delightful, the salt amplifying the richness of the chocolate homemade ice cream. The salted caramel was also delicious and the earl grey rivaled the superior quality of Shake Shake's. I will be sure to visit you when I come back!

It was a cold night, but there was still a line out the door. There was a bouncer, as another patron puts it, who directed the line. I already knew what I wanted, Salted Caramel, their most popular flavor. After inching toward the front of the line, I sampled the Orange Cardamom (recommended by the bouncer) and Earl Grey. The Orange Cardamon had a strong flavor, so it masked the Earl Grey. I tried some more of the Earl Grey and I loved it! As for my Salted Caramel, I also loved it! Creamy deliciousness! I'm glad I was not disappointed by this popular establishment! [As Seen On Unique Sweets]

I usually try to hit this spot whenever im home in the city or have guests visiting from out of town.  Its one of those spots you need to hit once, twice, three times, and so on. the strawberry balsamic should be on their regular menu its so freakin delicious.... the line is guaranteed to be long (like to the corner)  when theres any semblance of sun during the day, i guess it really depends how many samples people choose to take haha Def a place to check out while in SF, i can convert the non ice cream person into an ice cream lover (as I learned from one of my recent trips)

After yelping some sweet spots in SF and already stumbling upon Scream Sorbet I really wanted to try some ice cream. I arrived at Bi-Rite and the couple in front of me was literally sampling EVERY flavor, and there were a lot! I could have done this myself, and maybe I should have. But I didn't. I immediately saw salted caramel and knew I would try that, how can you go wrong with salted caramel? It reminded me of burnt marshmallows. I hope that doesn't turn anyone off to trying it, because I really liked it. I also had the malted vanilla, which doesn't stand out so distinctly in my memory....but I know I wasn't disappointed with either flavor.

I came here for the first time yesterday with a friend and my girlfriend and we were absolutely BLOWN AWAY. First of all, paaaaaaaacked! Two lines outside? for ice-cream? on a wednesday night?? whaaaaattt??? the wait wasn't too long, but i assure you, WELL WORTH IT! The employees inside looked like they LOVED their job even when they have a line around the corner and they were even dancing and singing to the music they were playing. It really added to our overal enjoyment of the place. Happy workers create happy customers. we sampled a lot of flavors first like the Basil, the Olive Oil, the Honey Lavender, etc etc and they were all very good, not overpowering.  I ended up getting the Salted Caramel and the Ricanelas. the salted caramel tasted bitter to me, and my friend who goes there a lot tasted it too and said it usually wasn't that intense, but i ate up that scoop first so i can enjoy my second scoop, the ricanelas, which was cinnamon ice-cream with bits of snickerdoodle cookies in it. one of my all-time favorites. My girlfriend got the coffee toffee ice cream which literally tasted like a sip of coffee every time! we loved it! I am sure to go here every time i'm in the city next time and i implore all of you to try it out!!! next time i'm going to get the balsamic strawberry and basil flavors ^_^

Like everyone else said...SALTED CARAMEL. And the Earl Grey was pretty good too. It's right by Dolores Park, so if you ever go on one of those nice summer strolls and find yourself getting a little heated, this place is perfect. Oh man, and after reading this review where someone mentioned Ricanelas, I need to go back there.

Much props to them and their workers. The line can be quite long (it's worth the wait) yet they can maintain excellent customer service without rushing customers or dropping their energy level. Balsamic Strawberry & Roasted Bananas -The strawberries tasted and felt fresh and the bananas tasted organic. The fusion itself went well. Usually bananas can be a dominant taste but there was great balance between the two. Sustainability efforts-Every time I go to an ice cream shop usually I do have the privilege to sample and when I do I use about 3 small PLASTIC spoons. Here, you use metal spoons. Overall: 5 stars for its overall efforts. Community building, efforts towards sustainability, charming customer service, unique and amazing ice cream: Win. It doesn't get any better. Thank you Bi-Rite for all that you do.

3 days and I've already eaten at Bi-Rite Creamery twice! A fan perhaps? I think so! Luckily, my wait for this place was less than 15 minutes. The first time, I got a single cup with two flavors: salted caramel and roasted banana. I wasn't a fan of the salted caramel but wanted to get it since it was the signature flavor. It was a bit too sweet for me.  The roasted banana was delicious and definitely had a unique taste to the palette. It had a roasted taste for sure and i love when a dessert has a strong banana flavor to it.   The second time I came I bought a scoop of ricanela (snicker doodle) on a cone. The pieces of snicker doodle cookies made the bite more adventurous and the portion was just enough to fill me and leave me satisfied.  Next time I would love to try the earl grey, which I heard was excellent! When you come, be prepared to wait a bit! Then head on over to Dolores Park and take some nice pics at the top of the hill :)

Salted Caramel is too sweet for me, but I do like the honey lavender a lot :) I came here for the first time on a Saturday morning. There was NO LINE UP. The guys who worked there let me try everything :D I don't think it's worth lining up an hour for, but I'm just not San Francisco enough to enjoy a good lineup. I'll definitely peek in when there's no line though!

Two great friends of ours took us to Bi-Rite after dinner at Butterfly. It was raining heavily so fortunately there was no line - pheww!!! However, we did not have so much luck on the parking part. The staff was extremely nice. They insisted on asking us to sample every individual flavors, which I've never seen before. I appreciate their effort because I believe that is how customers should be treated. The price is not too expensive and you get the quality you pay for. The ice cream texture is thick and creamy and the flavor is rich. Earl grey is my favorite among them! Single (1 flavor) Double (1-2 flavors) Triple (3-4 flavors)

I've not very particular with ice cream, but I must say that their Salted Caramel and Coffee Toffee ice cream is AMAZING!!!  Every time I'm at the gym, that's what I think about and it's such a shame that I live in SJ that it's not very easy to get to!  If anyone knows of a place that sells their ice cream pints in SJ area, LET ME KNOW PLEASE! After a so-so meal at Delfina, I had to make a pit-stop here to see if this place did justice as others claimed.  It was cold and windy outside, but we sucked it up and waited in line for 30 minutes.  My husband and I shared a scoop of the Salted Caramel and Coffee Toffee.  It was DEFINITELY worth the wait!  Not very sweet.  Apparently, the Coffee Toffee is made with coffee from Ritual Coffee Roasters.  I wonder how the other flavors taste.   Until we go to SF again, I found a temporary solution.  We found their Salted Caramel recipe online, so we're gonna attempt to make it with our Cuisinart ice cream maker.  Wish us luck!

I think it's weird that SF is really into it's ice cream and has a slew of good quality ice cream parlors considering that the weather is normally cold. But hey that never stopped me and apparently it didn't stop the other 4000+ yelpers who tried and loved this place. There was a short line since I went mid afternoon on a weekday, but still a line nonetheless and parking well... sf aint' known for parking. :P i tried the salted caramel since everyone raves about it and it was DELICIOUS and the Honey Lavender was great too. My friends recommended the earl grey, so i'll have to get that next time. BOTTOM LINE: Tourists go to Ghiradelli, but locals go to Bi-Rite Creamery!

Echoing all the reviews here. Seriously thick, creamy, and dense ice cream loaded with flavor. I've tried the trifecta (salted caramel, brown ginger with caramel swirl, malted vanilla with peanut brittle and chocolate) and the only bad part was finishing it. The malted vanilla was like swimming in a sea of creaminess, with the peanut brittle and chocolate serving as edible flotation devices. The salted caramel was the true highlight. Almost like having a caramel margarita or a caramel martini (which, coincidentally enough, I had soon after at Yoshi's). A real fiesta for the taste buds. I've also tried the ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles) and cookies and cream combo, which was a subtler, but still rich and creamy treat. Yes, the super, super long lines are a drawback - they've even marked the entire street corner with stanchions and belts to keep the crowds in check - so if you live in the area, it's a much better idea to grab a pint to take home at the separate dedicated window where there's no line. Or just keep on walking and burn those calories, but what's the fun in that? ;) Probably the best ice cream I've had anywhere, besides Toscanini's in Cambridge.

Clearly this place doesn't need another review - so here I go! An SF institution. The best ice cream in the U.S., possibly the world. The ricanelas is super tasty and the salted caramel will make you slap a puppy with joy (you've been warned). Go, just go. I lived here forever without going. I am dumb. Don't be dumb like me and go.

My first time: small sugar cone, two scoop, salted caramel and ricanela. Salted Caramel - Astounding. Every bite was somehow filled with even more flavor. I nearly remember each bite. I wished it lasted forever. Ricanela (snickerdoodle) - Pales in comparison to Salted Caramel. I felt like I could make this at home by throwing together Breyer's vanilla ice cream and cinnamon. I didn't think ice cream could have so much flavor.

Came here after getting a sandwich from Ike's Place. There was such a long line (like three separate ones) and it moved pretty slowly, but since every single review has been awesome, I was willing to wait. I got the Cookies n Cream and honestly I wasnt impressed. There was such a weird flavor to it and the ice cream wasn't creamy and rich. It really was nothing special at all. I also tried their famous Salted Caramel, and didn't like it. I like everything caramel but this just didn't taste good at all. The brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl was probably my favorite. I'm only giving them 3 stars because my friends enjoyed their ice cream but I dont think it lived up to the hype at all.

As a long time ice cream enthusiast, I can tell you how often I am disappointed when someone tells me "This ice cream is amazing!" As a result, I always remain very skeptical. However, when I first tried the ice cream here, it was more than amazing ice cream, it was a religious experience! There are no words for how much I adore this place. Riconela, the Dark Chocolate, the brown sugar. Thank you Bi-Rite, thank you for existing and restoring my hope for humanity. I love simplicity in my ice cream and I appreciate that they maintain this while still offering some adventurous flavors.   World peace is possible if we just all share some of your delicious ice cream! Okay, maybe that's a little extreme, but still, this ice cream is my favorite and if I could go there everyday, I would be giant.

Bi-Rite, oh how I love thee. Let me count the ways... Words alone cannot describe how much I love this place; they had me at first bite! It wasn't surprising how long the line was on a Saturday night, out the door and onto the street.. Surprisingly, it went by fast. The employees are very helpful and knowledgeable in terms of recommending flavor combinations. Very fun and interesting flavors you wouldn't find in a typical ice cream shop. I was able to get two flavors in a single scoop. The salted caramel and earl grey were absolutely amazing! Rich, creamy, and not too overly sweet. Will definitely come back but the only disadvantage is the street parking.

I'm not a fan of their famous salted caramel. My favorite is the earl grey, its a good place for dessert if you are in the area but for more flavorful fruit assortments I would go to mitchells. +side is their ice cream isn't too sweet! Watch out on weekends there may be a line outside.

If you live in San Francisco or are a tourist, Bi-Rite is the place to go. The line of people that wait for ice extends as far as the Great Wall of China especially on a hot day. Bi Rite ice cream really does have great ice cream but there are also many other very good ice cream places as well such as Mitchell's Ice Cream. The staff here is wonderful and everyone has such vibrant energy offering you those samples even if you have already tried them before. The Salted Caramel and Honey Lavender are hard to trump.

Bi-Rite is probably my Favorite ice cream shop in the city. I crave for it ALL the time, but it's popularity in the recent years has bummed me out. But of course, that is excellent for business. While driving by it in the last couple years, we've always seen lines hitting around the corner to Delores St. Wow! That alone tells you how great their products are. Bf first introduced Bi-Rite to me in 2007 and OMG I was in ice cream heaven. While he's into craft beer, I'm into "craft" ice cream! I have had their brownie sundae, Sam's sundae, roasted banana, salted caramel, balsamic strawberry, Afternoon snack, etc. in the past. I think I've sampled quite a few too. I've even had their sundaes to substitute for meals in the past! Their distinguished flavors and signature "creations" are what sets them apart from every other ice cream parlor I've been to. In addition to their ice cream, they also have freshly made cookies, packaged cookies, pints of ice cream, soft serve, soda pop, popsicles, etc. They have plenty of sweets to fulfill that rush! What I also admire about Bi-Rite is their story. People who are not from SF may not know that Bi-Rite was and still is a market/local store. It's just across the street from the creamery. I've been to the market before the creamery was even acquired. Further, I appreciate that they are a local business that is SO successful in the city's Mission District.

Quite possibly one of the best ice creams I have ever tasted. I can't believe I did not come here the last time I was in SF. Grab some ice cream and head over across the street to Dolores Park! The park has a new and awesome playground for kids. And for the older kids, plenty of space for your picnic blanket (and maybe a mini grill). Salted caramel, honey lavender, brown sugar, balsamic strawberry...drooooool. I doubt that the other flavors are disappointing. The cookies are chewy and tasty as well. The line is long but moves fast. I love how they partition it to leave the sidewalk open (NYC! You should learn.).

I'm actually not that big of a fan of ice cream, so me giving Bi-Rite 5 stars means something! Both my boyfriend and I have heard about this creamery before, so we decided to stop by a few hours before going to dinner. Thankfully there were only a couple people ahead of us in line. I had the white chocolate raspberry swirl and the salted caramel, and my bf had the ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodle bits) and the creme fraiche. Here's how I would rank the four flavors: 1. Ricanelas: DELICIOUS! Probably their best flavor. 2. White chocolate raspberry swirl: It was reaaally good. I would get it again. 3. Salted caramel: Eh, it was alright. 4. Creme fraiche: My boyfriend let me have a taste but considering that I don't even remember what it tastes like, it ranks #4. By the way, a single (2 scoops) is $3.50 and a double (3 scoops) is $5.00. I kind of wanted a double but I didn't want to spoil my appetite for dinner. I should have gotten it anyway, considering how dinner went... but that's a different review. HAPPY BI-RITING!

I've been here about 5 times and I don't know why I've never bothered to write a review. So far I have tried the coffee toffee sundae, salted caramel, honey lavender, roasted banana, earl grey, plum popsicle and chocolate ice cream with salt and olive oil. Out of everything I've tried I would only get the early grey again. I'm not sure why but everyone loves this place and I just can't figure out why. The place isn't bad but its not worth the wait. I won't mind coming again but only if someone else wants to go or I'm just in the neighborhood and there is no line.

She knows just how much I love ice cream. Seriously, I will choose ice cream over food any day! I LOVE THIS PLACE! I wish they had an actual sitting area, I mean they kind of have one outside, but it's very small knowing how packed &hectic it gets here! The ice cream itself was beyond AMAZING! I honestly don't remember what kinda ice cream I got specifically but I did get two scoops of two different types! Well actually I remember once being the Coffee Toffee, so good!

ICE CREAM. GOT TO TASTE IT IF YOU'RE IN SF. IT'S A MUST! I've tried the cinnamon one, strawberry and vanilla, My friend had the salted caramel. We both don't like salted caramel, but it tasted orgasmic! That was how godly good it was!!! Their ice cream had the right amount of cream, so it wasn't too much or too less, AND the temperature being served was perfect!! I definitely would come back here again!!! Also, 2.25 for a kids size ( 1 scoop) was definitely enough for one person as a dessert.

What can I say about a place that has a bajillion 5-star reviews?  This place ranks among my favorites (my #1 pick is still Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous because the ice creams just aren't as sweet). Delicious flavors (almond with fudge ripple, malted vanilla with a peanut brittle, salted caramel, chocolate coconut...I could go on all day), creamy but not sticky texture (*cough* Mitchell's *cough*), friendly staff. There.  One more 5-star review to toss into the mix.

Amazing ice cream and cookies!  I could only have a few little bites from my friend's ice cream, because I'm lactose intolerant, but I was able to have my very own "ice cream" made with coconut milk...and it was delicious!  I haven't been able to have ice cream in many years and today was the first time I was able to have something that tasted almost exactly like "normal" ice cream.  I am so thankful that a place exists where I can enjoy ice cream too :)   Needless to say, their baked goods are awesome too!

You're always guaranteed a line but never a seat. :) But even so, the ice cream here makes it ALL worth it. Since it was my first time, I took a plethora of samples. Which naturally, makes it even harder to make a decision when it's all delicious. Favorites that were really well done were the Earl Grey, Salted Caramel, Roasted Banana, and Toasted Coconut. It's not a huge selection, say like Baskin Robbins, but every flavor is true to it's name. It's also comforting to see that the ice cream were natural colors rather than being incredibly bright and fake. Ever since I left SF, I have been hankering for the Earl Grey and I've been kicking myself for not trying the ice cream with olive oil. So make sure you try both for me! :) There's even a really cute park across the street that has plenty of seating if the store becomes too crowded.

It feels a little bit blasphemous to rate this establishment only three stars when there are literally thousands of glowing reviews for it.  In my defense, however, this rating is not based on the ice cream alone. I would say the ice cream itself deserves four stars.  It's not the best artisan ice cream I've had, but it's definitely very good: decadent and creamy with a subtle flavor, and never overly sweet.  Some flavors are better than others.  The ones I've tried: * Salted Caramel -- Delicious, smooth, slightly bitter burnt taste that I really enjoy. * Honey Graham -- Really good.  The chocolate-covered housemade graham bits adds texture and keeps things interesting without being a flavor-overload. * Malted Vanilla with peanut brittle and chocolate -- Good, but kind of uninspired, in my opinion. * Balsamic Strawberry -- Above average for strawberry ice cream?  I know that's a pathetic description, but I personally have never been a big fan of strawberry ice cream, and this did not manage to convince me otherwise.  That said, I totally get why people like it; it's just not for me. They also offer other intriguing flavors such as honey lavender, basil, and olive oil. On that note, I wouldn't frequent this store when Bi-Rite Market is right across the street and offers the same flavors in pints at a better value and without the INSANE LINE.  The staff at the Market is also much friendlier from my experience.  Bi-Rite Creamery doesn't even make their own cones, so there really isn't much point in getting scoops there unless you're a visitor to San Francisco and won't be able to bring pints home with you... or if you wanted to sample new flavors before committing to a pint  :P UPDATE:  I tried the honey lavender, and it's the only flavor so far that I disliked.  Way too flowery for me.  I'm sure this is mostly a personal preference, so definitely try before you buy with this one.

Very yummy creamy ice cream that hits the spot after a day of city wandering, sight seeing or just running errands. Sweet creamy ice cream with simple flavors. They do not need to stand out with crazy assortments of combinations, just quality ice cream. Coffee Toffee, Roasted Banana and Salted Caramel are my go to ... wish I could have some right now

I've been wanting to try this place for a while and finally this weekend, I had my wish fulfilled! I got to try their honey lavender and earl grey flavored ice-cream on a cake cone and it was AMAZING! It wasn't too sweet or overly creamy. It was just the right amount of creaminess and so refreshing! I could eat the Earl Grey one forever! At first, I wasn't too sure about the honey lavender since it basically tasted like an aromatherapy lotion.. but eventually I got used to it! The line for this place was also pretty long but I didn't mind the wait after getting a taste of their ice-cream!

BEST ICE CREAM IN SF!! Didn't expect much from this "weird, unique" flavors ice cream. Tried several flavors, but my favs are: Brown Sugar: My favorite! Even though there's some hints of ginger (I hate ginger), but this ice cream by far still my fav! Balsamic Strawberry: Sounds weird, but oh boy, I'm flying. Roasted Banana: I can eat the whole pint! The banana flavors is not too strong, not too bland. Just hit the target! Salted Caramel: SOO SOOO SOOOOO GOOD!! I can't even describe it in words! One bad thing about this place: You're gonna come back for more and more and more!!!!

Flavors are really unique and equally as yummy!  The only problem is that you will likey have to wait in a looong line to get some.

Enough reviews already! Why do I even bother? The line(s) looked a bit intimidating but they are very organized and move quickly.  I got a scoop of Roasted Bananas (yum!) and a scoop of Creme Fraiche (not as amazing as I had expected).  My bf ordered a fancy sundae.  The ice cream was delicious but made me feel extra cold on an already-chilly day.

- Locale Destination - It's on 18th St and Doloress St in San Francisco. The location - right across street from Dolores Park - and the ice cream quality make a ridiculously long line. Go there on a weekday, when raining, or when cold so that you can avoid the line. If you want to get bigger sizes like a pint size, those are ready to go at the fridge nearby the counter. They take a credit card!! Decor is pretty simple and casual. Cozy atmosphere. They got a few tables inside and outside seating. You need to get a key for bathroom - it's on the counter. The staff are very friendly. Ask for tasting and try them before buying it. Don't do that so much if the line were long... ;p I think the price is very reasonable for the gourmet ice cream. Less quality ice cream/gelato places in OC/LA charge a lot more than this.   - Gluttony Expedition - They got ice cream, soft serve, cupcakes etc.... Earl gray: Awww.. My favorite. Love it. Honey lavender: Lavender flavor was strong yet delicate. I like it ;) Brown sugar: Ice cream itself was just so so but the caramel sauce was a bit bitter and very very very good. It enhanced the ice cream. Good. Roasted banana: Great roasted banana flavor. Love it. Salted caramel: Too rich for me. One bite is enough for me. Over-hyped. Meh. Ginger: Very ginger - strong flavor. Not for me. Balsamic strawberry: Seasonal, not now ;( Ugh.. I was soooo looking forward to it ;( - Conqueror's Deduction - Many of my yelp friends told me about this place, so I was so excited to try their ice cream. Very tasty ice cream. It's light yet sophisticated creamy texture. Nothing is overly sweetened. Great flavors and interesting flavor varieties. High quality ice cream. The hype was very true!! I think "Bi-Rite" is slightly better than other competitors overall. I also liked the choices of scoop size - the small size allowed me to enjoy several flavors without being too full. Also you can go big! I tried several super popular places as well - "Mitchell's" and "Humphry Slocombe Ice Cream". These are my overall opinions: - "Humphry" is very similar to "Bi-Rite" (quality wise) but slightly lighter than "Bi-Rite". "Bi-Rite" is a bit better. "Humphry" got more peculiar/exotic flavors (Breakfast, saffron etc.) and less varieties than "Bi-Rite". You need to be more adventurous at "Humphry" than "Bi-Rite". "Humphry" got a less line than "Bi-Rite", which is great. - "Mitchell's" is a lot creamier, less sophisticated, bolder flavors and got more Asian flavors than "Bi-Rite". "Bi-Rite" is like a "Fine Dining" ice cream, and "Mitchell's" is like a "Pop&Mom" ice cream.

It was my first time here, so I got the Trifecta (Brown Sugar, Malted Vanilla, and Salted Caramel).  All three flavors were really good.  I liked the Malted Vanilla the most! I waited in a long line that rounded the corner.  It was also very windy and cold.  But it was worth the wait.

I have a hard time saying no when I get invited to Bi-Rite, but it's always a schlep because of the hard time you'll have parking and the line. HOWEVER, I must say that sometimes being in a line can do you some good. It gives you time to sit and stew about the offerings of the daily menu at Bi-Rite, and let's you settle into a few select flavor combinations that you will no doubt be mashing together in a cone or cup in just minutes. One of my classic fav's is the Lavender ice cream. It's uncommon, slightly unusual, but refreshing nonetheless. I also got got the Another plus side to rolling deep with your crew to Bi-Rite is the continued sampling that happens once you park it with your scoops and bravely dip into your friends' selections. Sharing is caring, especially when it comes to ice cream.

4 scoops = fattie right here!  It's all just for me :)  The line is really long but it's worth it.   The flavors I tried were ricanelas, salted caramel, brown sugar, and balsamic strawberry.  The strawberry wasn't one of my choices and was my least favorite but a worker there recommended it so I decided to give it a try.  My favorite of the 4 was the ricanelas.  If I could bring back ice cream with me then I would have!  It's so delicious!  Im sad I only went one time.  This place deserves multiple trips.  I must think of a work reason to come back to the bay now then i'll come back again!

You know what's nice? When you go to a place that has a large variety of flavors, and you can count on the person behind the counter to suggest something to you. I went into Bi-Rite on my tip to SF because well, I had it recommended to me 3 times. You can't ignore suggestion like that. So I go in with my friend/tour guide, and I already knew that my first flavor was going to be earl grey. Earl grey ice cream is always good, how could I go wrong? But then the cashier said "you can get two flavors" and I didn't know what to do, so I asked "what would you pair it with?" and she suggested the honey lavender flavor. Great choice! First of all, the ice cream is just about the smoothest I've ever had. The earl grey had a strong flavor, and the honey lavender was milder, by comparison, but both were unique and delicious. I'm glad the suggestions weren't wrong. Bi-Rite is really something, and I wish I had gone more than once.

My favorite two flavors are the Earl Grey and the Honey Lavender. Both are delicate flavors that I truly enjoyed. Though, I'm a Ici (a Berkeley creamery) girl at heart...especially since Ici has handmade wafer cones; Bi-Rite lacks in this domain. But hey I need to cover my go-to ice cream bases from both sides of the bridge, right? ;) Oh and Salted Caramel ice cream was overrated. Stop overhyping it!

The ice cream was decent, but $7+ for a sundae when it was basically a bowl of ice cream with some chunks of cookies is a bit over priced. We got here when there wasnt not a line, without a line its 3 stars and is not bad, I wouldnt wait in line if there was one. Plus one guy behind the counter seemed to hate his job, you had 3-4 happy employees and 1 dude that seem grouchy haha

Bi-rite, you are more infamous in SF than that viral video of KONY. Dare I say you are CONE-Y? Your ever so popular salted caramel is pretty good, and I hear a lot of good things about your Ricanelas, but my personal fave is the malted vanilla. I'm all about a simple ice cream flavor with nice textures and toppings mixed into the ice cream. so peanut brittle and chocolate pieces inside? nice. Your long lines? cruelty to those who flock to you for protection from the heat. However, you do a good job at moving it as fast as you can. It gives us time to catch up with friends or family. Have real face time and not the apple vesion. Your staff is very helpful and courteous and you have lots of options and varieties as far as how we want our ice cream. You are really good, I like other places better,  (HS and M&MM, I'll leave those abbreviated since the review isn't about them) mainly because it's equal quality for a shorter or no line, and MUCH EASIER to find parking around. It's not because of your quality, so you just keep doing you!

I really love this, but one of the things I really liked most about it was that when I used to come before, they would always have a new interesting flavor to try. I liked their ginger and basil flavor, but I don't see it around anymore. They used to at least have a sign to ask for the ginger flavor, but they don't anymore. I don't know if I'm just suppose to ask for it, but next time I'll be sure to try. They also have a bakery a few steps down that also sells soft serve and they used to sell the yummiest ice cream shaped cookies. They had them in different flavors like salted caramel, balsamic strawberry, and I think one other flavor.  I don't know why they don't make them anymore, but they should bring them back cuz I miss them! Other than that, the salted caramel soft serve is definitely worth the try. Flavors i would recommend are the salted caramel, brown sugar, ricanelas, earl grey (if they still have it), roasted banana...actually they're all really good haha but these are just a few of my favorites.

Bi-Rite's got a great mix of value ($2.50 for two scoops) and flavor (the salted caramel is a San Francisco institution, but you'll find kid-friendly staples mixed in with crazier flavors). The lines are insane, if you're in SF on a rare hot day you can count on at least twenty people queued up. My two pro-tips: 1) Eat ice cream before your meal. Come just at noon, or even earlier. 2) Order pints or ice cream cakes over the phone. That way, you can skip the line and go right to the counter. You miss the magic part of tasting the different flavors and watching them scoop out your one or two favorites, but you get that much more time back to spend in Dolores Park.

I love ice cream and Bi-Rite deserves its high remarks. The typical 20-30 minute wait is worth it! Trust me, the smell of the cones, cookies, and ice cream will get you hooked. As for the flavors, here it goes: Salted caramel, the most famous: 3/5 - it's good, but I expected a lot more. Ricanelas: 6/5 - OMG, snickerdoodle in my mouth. Coffee toffee: 5/5 - I love coffee so anything coffee flavored is a win in my book. Cookies and cream: 4/5 - It's good, but why come to Bi-Rite for a common flavor? Tip: If you order in a cup, you can ask for the cone on top for no extra charge. :)

Decided to finally see what all the hype was about at bi-rite. I felt like I was the only sf bred kid that had yet to try the awesome-ness of bi-rite. So off i went, dragging boyfriend to wait in the drenches with me. The line went pretty fast, while we waited menus were passed down the line. I decided to try a trio sample of lavender honey, earl grey and the infamous salted caramel. Boyfriend decided to be creative, and order a coke float with a scoop of pomegranate sorbet and brown sugar ice cream. Lavender honey is very subtle, as is earl grey. My favorite is the salted caramel, has a powerful kick to it. Hard to describe this distinct flavor but something that i'll remember. (Which means you should try it!) Boyfriend's concoction, was surprisingly yummy combo. The fruit pom mixed well with the brown sugar, tasting like a creamy orange pop! Conclusion: Definitely coming back to try other flavor combos!

Came up to SF for the SF marathon.  Came around 4:30pm on a thursday, no line when I arrived.  But as soon as I ordered my salted caramel and ricandas, there was a line of about 20 people.  Salted caramel tends to be the flavor most people compare between ice cream joints.  I wouldn't say this is the best salted caramel I have but it is top tier.  Ricandas was a solid flavor too.

I now know for certain that there's an ice-cream heaven - the only kind of heaven, as far as I'm concerned - because I've been there. And it's called Bi-Rite Creamery. Sure, I've walked past on sunny days and seen the line winding around the corner. But I always dismissed it, chalking it up to the fact that warm weather makes people crave ice cream. Unless you're me, in which case you crave ice cream in all weather all the time. Point is, I truly didn't realize how amazing their product was until I finally put it in my mouth (that's what she said, I know, I know). Bi-Rite offers an incredible array of homemade flavors, such as - and yes, I tried ALL of these: salted caramel, vegan chocolate coconut, honey lavender, malted vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate pieces and brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl. The woman scooping behind the counter saw the look on my face and just kept giving me samples. It was amaaaazing. The toppings are equally as awe-inspiring, and I felt like my order simply wouldn't be complete without almond toffee or peanut brittle. I was right. There is a small corner with benches, and if you're lucky enough to snag a table, it's amazing just to sit and smell the aromas of the creamery. The waffle cones are wafting, cookies are baking, the place might as well burst into song. As we walked out of Bi-Rite at 9:30pm on this particularly cool evening, a guy walking past us turned to his friends and said, "Who would get ice cream in THIS temperature?" I grinned and yelled, "MEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!"

Holy moly, the line is super long!!! I don't think that it helped that my friends and I were here on a day where there was an event at the park nearby. There's a far shorter line for soft serve versus the fancy churned ice cream, though we didn't have the advantage to choose from a variety of flavors. And it was still $3.50 for a cup. My selection: vanilla, chocolate, or swirl. The soft serve was actually really good. There was a noticeable difference between this soft serve and any other brand of soft serve ice cream. Definitely a difference in the milk, not the sugar. We took the ice cream to the park nearby and just chilled on the grass while eating the soft serve. Very nice for a sunny day. Was overall very good. Wouldn't come here to wait in line nor to eat the soft serve again, but I wasn't an ice cream person to begin with.

Very creamy, unique flavors. (Brown sugar w/ caramel ginger? Yes please). The line's ridiculous--and unjustified--but it's a very solid option during a down time and/or when you've just finished up a scrumptious margherita pizza at Delfina across the street. Try the salty caramel--if you like a little burnt bite flavor when you swallow.

I LOVE BI-RITE! ITS SO GOOD!!! The ice cream is creamy and full of flavor. The flavors I like are the honey lavender and the salter caramel, even better if you put them together. I mean... GENIUS! They have the new earl grey flavor, ugh its great too. it kinda puts me in a weird bind, so when u get into the front of the line and you have to try both, when u secretly know how both of them taste, but you have to try because you just can't decide (i really need to stop doing this)... solution: switch, one day earl grey, one day. Let's save some time here people... the line is long. When u really wanna treat yoself throw the salted caramel in there! I always get one kid scoop, cheaper, less calories, not too indulgent on a regular cone. winner! Customer service is excellent, willing to to cater to your taste bud needs even when it means 10 tastings. They also offer great suggestions! Tip: go to Delores Park across the street and enjoy your sweet there.

Staple of the Mission community! So many reviews have been posted already so I'll keep it brief. Parking Sucks Ambiance/Seating: Nice shop with many interesting things for sale. They have both indoor and outdoor seating, but it can get crowded at times. It's ok though because you can sit at the park outside. Ice-Cream: AWESOME! I got the coffee with almond toffee bits and the brown sugar with ginger caramel. I would recommend both! The coffee had strong flavor which perfectly contrasted with the sweet/salty toffee bits. I wished the brown sugar ice-cream had stronger ginger flavor, but it was also very tasty and a cleaner contrast from the coffee. Overall: Great Place that I would totally recommend you check out if you're in the area. They have a wide range of flavors and also sell pre-packed pints and banana splits. Tasty Tasty Tasty!

Good ice cream, but I'm not sure it's worth the 20 minute wait just to get inside. The salted caramel is good, but I'm a fan of earl grey and honey lavender, two flavors that are a bit more subtle. Not too sweet, with great floral undertones. The last time I was there, I tried the balsamic strawberry. It's an interesting combination of flavors, though thankfully it was more strawberry than balsamic. Will have to try olive oil the next time I'm there.

"dainty gent, dainty gent, dainty gent!!!!" My friend made this comment on my fb and was also the first to appear after checking in.  She and my gf had been raving about this flavor ever since they had it, saying it was the best they'd ever had.  I on the other hand wrote it off since the combination of flavors freaked me out a little (honey lavender, blood orange olive oil, fudge and sea salt).  They told me "don't knock it till you've tried it!"  Well I finally got a chance to visit this place with my lovely gf and were ready to get the dainty gent,  but unfortunately we didn't since it was $7 instead of the $4-5 they had remembered it to be. :( But that aside, we still gleefully scooped mounds of delicious ice cream into our mouths.  We got a "Double" size, which is 3 scoops of your choice of flavors for $5.  We got the Honey Lavender (yummm), Earl Grey (yummmm), and the Blood Orange sorbet (yummmmm).  (Note: Yums are in no particular order and the number of m's does not mean i liked one more than the other). The honey lavender did not have the kick I was expecting from lavender (I forgot what food/drink i had that contained lavender in it before, I only remember it had some kind of pungent kick to it, though not peppery).  In fact this went down very smooth with a hint of flora and had a subtle sweetness to it and was quite delicious. The earl grey was very good as well.  It reminded me of milk tea, which probably makes sense since it has a mild earl grey flavor mixed in with cream/dairy.  I don't really like drinking earl grey by itself cuz of the bergamot flavoring, but there was only a hint of it here.  I guess this is how the English do.  I love boba/milk tea.  I guess it makes sense that I liked this too. The blood orange sorbet was delightfully tart and refreshing and was a nice complement to the other two flavors when the creaminess got a bit heavy. Before we got our ice cream, there was a bit of a line that went around the corner.  It ended up only being about a 10-15 minute wait, but while we were in line, somebody form the shop walked down and handed out samples of a salted caramel/chocolate swirl soft serve.  Crapnuts that was good too.  I didn't taste the salted caramel as much as i did the chocolate, but it was not salt and not overly sweet.  I was going to enjoy it slowly so that it would last me the line, but I pretty much ended up sucking face with the little paper container (like those ketchup holder cups from fast food burger joints) to get all the ice cream out.  It only lasted me about 3 steps. Overall the flavors were very good.  Only giving it 4 stars cuz of the supposed price hike for the dainty gent/sundae.  I'll probably get another chance to head back someday and splurge on it just to see what all the fuss is about.  I will definitely be returning.

Next stop on the gluttony train: Bi-Rite! Yes, my best friend was in town. Yes, my bf is my ORIGINAL eating buddy. Yes, I subconsciously want diabetes (obviously). Yes, we came here after bottomless mimosa brunch, complete with appetizer and 2 desserts. Why? 1) Because it was down the street, and 2) because we can! Was it worth the 30 min+ wait? Well, it gave me more time to digest brunch...so...sure, why not? * Earl grey: very light - tasted great with the orange cardamom * Orange cardamom - yum! * Ginger - my favorite, next to the earl gray * Chocolate - I don't like chocolate ice cream, but it was so rich and REAL tasting! * Salted caramel - delish, but couldn't eat more than a few bites before getting a headache Long-ass line(neg) + Quality(pos) + Friendly customer service (pos) = 4.5 Stars

Very good, I know everyone raves the caramel but the toasted coconut was amazing. We did have to wait 30 mins but it really was not that bad, they keep the line moving. Parking is almost non-existent

I have been here many times and never wrote a review because there are already a million reviews that kind of say the same thing.  Then I had a hankering for BiRite the other night, bought a pint, and now writing a review while pigging away on this pint. My favorites: Earl Grey - tastes like milk tea Balsamic Strawberry - it's like strawberry ice cream with a twist Okay, I would actually eat most, if not all the flavors they have to offer. I think I have gotten smarter bypassing the line by buying pints and/or quarts of ice cream, but realistically, I have only gotten rounder. :P

Bi RIte oh Bi Rite.... For someone who isn't really THAT fond of ice cream, you blow me away with your creative flavors, soft churned ice cream.  :) I went there on a saturday evening...the line was so long it wrapped around the block.  I was there with the BF..and although we wanted to try all the flavors...I don't think our stomachs would have agreed to that. The flavors we tried: Infamous Salted caramel (the most creamiest out of all i tried) malted vanilla w/peanut brittle & milk chocolate pieces ( I couldn't decide if i like this one or Salted caramel better :) Coffee toffee (super good too!) Balsamic Strawberry (This was not bad, but the last flavor to stay in the bowl) Honey Lavender ( I asked for a sample of this and passed it up, it was only ok to me) I can't wait to come back.  Next time though, i would buy a pint of the salted caramel as its only $8.   Pricing: I can't remember exactly but it ranges somewhere around: one scoop:  $4.00 two scoop :  $5.00 three scoop:$6.50 Its definitely worth a visit if you guys like ice cream, in the area.  For sac folks, its way better than Leatherby's and even Gunthers.  :)

Love the ice cream here! Yes, you have to wait in line most of the days but the line moves fast. They let you taste as many flavors and there are some amazing flavors here, so it is hard to decide. They also have great sundaes but it's the ice cream that makes me come here whenever I am in San Francisco. My favorite flavors are the salted caramel, coffee toffee, cinnamon and ginger....the ginger one made me cry out in delight, the flavor is so subtle and so good...it's amazing. My husband had the brownie sundae (housemade decadent brownies with vanilla ice cream, chocolate and burnt caramel sauces, whipped cream, and candied pecans)...it was delicious! Unfortunately, my husband liked it too much to share, so all I could get was a bite but it was heavenly! Another thing had won me over was their bio-degradable spoons and containers...awesome! Overall, delicious and freshly made ice-cream....you can't go wrong by coming here. I only wish I was in SF longer so I could try more flavors. If they open one in LA, I would be a regular here for sure.

Sitting back in my humble Brisbane abode there is something missing from my life. Bi-Rite Creamery, where are you? No ice cream compares to the salted caramel, chocolate coconut, roasted banana and earl grey flavours that danced in my mouth the night you and I met, Bi-Rite Creamery. Until we meet again I will suffer the sub-standard offerings on Australian soil.

I went on labor day when there was an event at the nearby park so the line was out the door and around the street corner, but luckily we only waited about 15 or so minutes. I went with my boyfriend so we ended up getting a combined total of 5 flavors.. Of all of them, my favorite were Ricanelas and Malted Vanilla

After eating a hearty, soul satisfying and delicious sandwich at Ike's, walk over to Bi-Rite (to burn come calories) and consume of Bi-Rite's delicious ice cream.  Seriously, after eating their ginger ice cream, I bought an ice cream maker to replicate the recipe.  Why? When I can go to Bi-Rite?  Well, its 600 miles away from where I live so I can't go anytime I want like you lucky people who live in the bay area. It's always busy, really limited seating, but who cares when you can order a couple of scoop and eat it as you walk around and enjoy the beautiful city outside.   They have a bunch of flavors and you can even purchase it by the pint to take home.  I should have done this last time!! This is the only creamery that I have ever been to where I don't feel guilty for consuming so much ice cream.  I don't know why really, maybe because it's so gosh darn good that my body doesn't care about the after effects.   If you are in the bay, don't go to Baskin Robbins or Cold Stone, actually make the trip here.  It will be worth your while.

I was in town with a couple of friends and we were trying to do all the "touristy" things in a weekend so we picked up some Ike's and went to Dolores Park for a picnic. I met up with my roommate from college who I hadn't seen in a while and she suggested we walk to Bi-Rite bc i guess it was just across the street. Trying to hit all the "hot spots" and having heard recommendations about this place we got there and of course, a line. I'm not sure how long we waited because we were catching up the entire time but it had to have been around half an hour. Anyways we were handed menus in line so i had a chance to peruse the flavors and decided on the balsamic strawberry and the peach sorbet which i both loved. My other friends got the Ricanelas and the Salted Caramel which they all finished before we even made it back to Dolores so i'm assuming they were good. I forgot how much it was but I don't think it was more than $5 for two flavors which is a definite bargain. Anyways, if you're in SF and you want some unique ice cream and have some time to spare, definitely stop by. oh and the workers all seemed really nice and genuinely happy. they were also really patient bc my friend taste tested like four flavors before she decided  lol.

We were there at 10:30 PM and OMG, the line was crazily long.  Waited 30 min to get a single size of 2 small scoops of salted caramel and toasted coconut ice cream.  Not bad at all.  However, please fix up the place to not have the restroom  right in front of our face while we tried to enjoy our treats after a long wait.  It's just gross to hear and smell things, ya know.

What I ordered: Trifecta = salted caramel, brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl, and malted vanilla with peanut brittle and chocolate (A-) I am beyond over the ice cream fad. I know i'm going to lose a foot to type 2 diabetes anytime I try anything adventurous at Cold Stone's and no amount of celebrity inspired junk is going to make me shell out dough for Ben & Jerry's. Sorry Berkeley favorite Ici, I do not want your Rose Petal flavored ice cream, I've eaten one in real life, not good. In Ice Cream form? Not appealing to me in the slightest. And after hearing endless rants about the amazingness that is Bi-Rite, I was pretty sure that I was immune to this one too... I was wrong. The long lines are worth every second, do yourself a favor, ignore the impatient people behind you when you get to the front and take your time to sample anything you desire (which is precisely why the line is so long to begin with but well worth it). I'm sure you've read earl grey and honey lavender are staples but I went classic and got a trifecta, not too sweet and completely refreshing. To get the full effect get it in a cup so you can get a spoonful of all three at the same time, you'll go blind for a couple of seconds and meet God.

80 degrees on a scorching ass day in the city and craving some ice cream to cool us down. Bi-rite is the first place that comes to mind plus the wifey's been craving it. Finally found parking and that can be seriously challenging, especially when what appears to be rave/BBQ across the street at Dolores Park. The line was wrapped around the corner as it sometimes gets but it does move quickly. I always say I'll try something different but when it comes to ordering SALTED CARAMEL comes out of my mouth. Got two scoops and killed it wishing I get a brain freeze! TIP: You can bypass the line if you want some of the pre-packed ice cream and they have a second window if you want soft serve.

Scoops v. Bi-Rite, Scoops v. Bi-Rite.  I tried really hard to like Bi-Rite just as much as I enjoyed Scoops in Los Angeles.  What can I say, I'm spoiled by Scoops.  Salty caramel was good but not the best I've tasted, Mexican Chocolate just tasted like chocolate to me, and I haven't tried the famed earl grey ice cream yet.  Maybe it will change my mind.   Although it was delicious, it didn't feel novel and that's why I didn't like it as much as I would've liked.   Oh and tip, if you know you like a flavor, you can buy a pint and bring it home with you.  In a marginally insulated bag, it survived all the way from SF to Mountain View.  +1 for durability!

I am almost tempted to give this place 5 stars. Hubby and I were lucky to go on a rainy Saturday when there was no line. I had a friend tell me the Sam's Sundae was really good, so I tried that. It's such a great combo of chocolate ice cream, bergamot olive oil, Maldon sea salt, and whipped cream. This combo all comes down to how interesting the olive oil is and the salt for contrast. It is a complex explosion of flavors in your mouth and one of the most unique desserts I have tasted. I really liked it. We also tasted some other flavors including Ricanelas (totally awesome!) and the brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl (my fave!). The only bummer was I tried it with a little squeeze of their caramel sauce and that stuff is bitter! Other reviewers are right when they say it is "burnt" caramel. Too burned for me, I don't like it bitter like that. Hubby got the Ricanelas and Malted Vanilla with peanut brittle. I'm not even a huge ice cream fan, but I did my "good food happy dance" all the way down the sidewalk as I ate my ice cream. Yes, it's that good!

The last time I was here, I waited in line for about 30 minutes.  It was a Memorial Day weekend, so what do you expect?  But because I waited for so long, I saw the misfortunate of a pigeon flying into a window above Bi-Rite, instantly killing itself. RIP pigeon.  Fly in spirit. Standard flavors, but, the ice cream is so damn rich and so damn tasty.  I paid for it bigtime, about 1/2 hour later (which is about the amount of time I spent in line) because of my lactose intolerance.  But that stomach and intenstinal disaster was so worth it.

Came here for the first time yesterday after hearing about them for a long time, and decided I needed to try the salted caramel ice cream that everyone was raving about (and also to check off another 2012 Big Eat). Since it was a Monday afternoon, there was absolutely no line and we were taken care of right away. I decided to get two scoops of the salted caramel, and omg I was in heaven. I also tried their Earl Gray, and I almost regret not getting a scoop of that along with my salted caramel. Just a little warning, you may want to get your ice cream in a cup if you don't plan to inhale it, because this stuff melts FAST. Not even halfway through the first scoop, and the ice cream was dripping down our hands; we had to go back in to ask for a cup to put the ice cream in to further avoid a sticky disaster. Other than the super quick melting of the ice cream, totally worth it!

Bi-Rite Creamery came out as highly recommended by one of my friends who lives in San Francisco. Since then, I have been wanting to go here. On a Saturday night, when we were up in the city, I didn't want to miss the opportunity. Parking is on the street and it is a pain before one find a parking space. As we drove close to the Bi-Rite Creamery, we were alarmed to see a long line around the corner. We waited in the line for 20-30min before it was our turn to order the ice-cream. The good thing is, the line moves really quick because the service is zippy. I ordered an Afternoon Snack Sundae, that came with roasted banana ice-cream, caramel, whipped cream. It was delectable; absolutely mouth watering. My husband ordered a scoop of Salted Caramel and it was delicious too. So much worth the wait. The ice-cream parlor is really small, with 3 or 4 small seats inside. Most of them brought the ice-cream outside and ate by the streets. The flavors are exceptionally good; certainly a must-try. You will never be disappointed here!

OMG ice cream! Yes, there will be a line out the door and around the block, but it moves quickly and it's worth the wait! I love that they use real spoons for tasting so there's less waste, and I love that the staff was dancing and singing to the music despite the long lines. My only advice: get the single. It doesn't mean single scoop. If fact, you get two generous scoops! I got the Mint Chip and the hubby got the salted caramel. Both were delicious and with mine being a single and his a double we still paid only ~$8. What a great deal. We will be back!

This place was calling my name after I tried Coffee Toffee from a pint my sister brought home. As we rolled up past the Bi-Rite sign, there wasn't a single person in line and I seriously thought it was my lucky night... then I looked up the street and realized I had only seen the market; the actual creamery was up further. The line stretched around the block! Luckily, the line actually moves quickly. If you just want to buy a take-home pint, go right up to the counter. They have some weird cococtions and while I can't say I absolutely love each one, the best thing about their ice cream is that all the flavors just come together well regardless of how odd the ingredients sound. Coffee Toffee is by far the best with a strong coffee element (what else?) and bits of sweet toffee to balance it out. I also enjoyed the burnt, smoky flavor of Salted Caramel. These are a popular must-try! Orange Cardamom had me curious... found out it was a spice that makes the ice cream taste like ginger. It wasn't bad but wasn't for me. Honey Lavender was interesting in that it made me feel like I was eating a spa. Or eating lavender oil used in a spa. Could be gross or delicious depending on how you look at it. Again, the flavors came together well, just didn't tickle my taste buds the way Coffee Toffee and Salted Caramel did. Will be back to try their other popular must-try, Earl Grey.

I am such a sucker for unique ice cream flavors. Bi-Rite is just the place for me. I am not much of a sweets person but I could gorge myself everyday on their salted caramel. You can really taste the salt in it whereas other salted caramels I've had before are shy with that. The balsamic strawberry is a second favorite of mine and those two are my go-tos. I've had friends rave about the honey lavender, although I'm not a huge lavender fan. Any time I'm in the neighborhood I make sure to stop by here. Hell, even when I'm not I try to make the trip out. Be prepared for a wait unless you're going at some random weekday at a weird time. This place is seriously popular. Great, now I'm craving some salted caramel...

After hearing so much hype about this place, and numerous Facebook pictures friends posted holding their ice cream bowls in front of this ice cream shop, I just knew I had to try it soon...so here I was! Was hoping to wait in line with hubby, and eat ice cream together inside, but it was impossible to find street parking tonight. So after circling around the block a few times, I hopped out of the car holding a $5 bill to grab my ice cream to go. For $5 it gets you 2-3 scoops of ice cream, and I chose Earl Grey, Salted Caramel and Honey Lavender. Earl Grey was refreshing and tasted like a cup of super sweet tea. This is a flavor I have never tried before in an ice cream and was definitely very interesting for me. A big thumbs up! Salted Caramel -- anything caramel wins my vote, and this was no exception. However I do feel that it is a tad sweet and overpowered the salted part of the caramel. Honey Lavender is another interesting choice for ice cream for me. As far as aromatherapy bath and body products go, I am not a huge fan of lavender scent. But I decided to be adv.enturous today, and I am glad I did. It wasn't bad at all, at least not with the one scoop of it that I had today...I can't imagine myself eating too much of this in one setting though, even at the end of my scoop I started to feel like I was licking my body lotion. Would I come here again? yes...I would love to try more flavors, and come hang out with my friends here. But I am not driving to this place again

I've developed a mad taste for Bi-Rite's Candy Cane flavor, which is available only in Decemberish. I don't really know what I'm going to do next Decemberish, because I've given up dairy products, but I will say this: I officially became vegan in mid-January. Coincidence? I think not. While I contemplate all of the circuitous routes I'll be inventing to avoid Bi-Rite later this year, I am thoroughly enjoying their chocolate coconut vegan flavor. I also grudgingly appreciate the fact that, when you order vegan ice cream, they warn you of the milk products in the hot fudge sauce if you try to sneak that in. Bastards. I mean, thanks guys, you totally have my back. Yeah, I'm new to this.  But in all seriousness, Bi-Rite does actually have your back if you are trying to avoid dairy. The ice cream is also phenomenal, but you already knew that. There are 4430 reviews now, and the overall rating is still 4.5 stars.

Great place to cool off on a rare hot San Francisco day! I didn't care too much for the long wait, but if you can get here early do avoid the long line. Located in a high foot/car traffic area, skip the car ride (because parking will be difficult) and take public transportation and go for a walk. Finally got up front and got a scoop of Coffee Toffee and Earl Grey. Yum! The coffee toffee was delightful and full of toffee crunch! Earl Grey was a little sweet for my liking but still good nonetheless.   I'll come back again on another abnormal San Francisco mini heat wave day. I can't wait!

I'm not an ice cream fanatic, but I can say with confidence that Humphry Slocombe has got my vote for best ice cream in San Francisco.  I'm sure thousands will disagree, but I'm also sure that just as many will agree. I tried 4 flavors at Bi-Rite: Cookies 'n Cream Almond Fudge Swirl Coffee Toffee Salted Caramel Cookies 'n Cream - I've had better at Carvel.  At Carvel the actually crumble the entire cookie (w/ filling) into the ice cream.  I was expecting the same at Bi-Rite. Almond Fudge Swirl - A new flavor that didn't explode nearly as much as I had hoped. Coffee Toffee - decent, but I prefer the Vietnamese Coffee at Humphry's. Salted Caramel - very good, but I'm going to say that Sweet Rose Creamery (LA) is better. Are the long lines justified?  -probably for the other flavors... I didn't try all the flavors, but I wasn't overly impressed with the flavors I did try.  And because the lines were so long, I didn't want to be a punk and hold it up any further by asking for a taste of everything. Prior to visiting Bi-Rite, I had sampled the "Complete Breakfast" as Humphry's and also had the most amazing gelato pairing at the Ferry Bldg.  So it's not like I was overly hyped.  I was still on cloud 9 from my previous experiences.  Unfortunately, Bi-Rite brought me back down to earth. I'm sorry Yelp friends...

There's not much else to say about Bi-Rite. Their 4.5 stars on Yelp basically sum up their awesomeness. When I went on 3/24/12, one of the workers said their Earl Gray ice cream will only be made for another month!!!! :( :(  If that's a favorite (which it well should be), you better go and stock up on as much Earl Gray before it's gone. Forever. Le sigh.

Accidentally discovered this place when I saw a line outside (Wednesday night before closing). Took about 10 minutes, to get ice cream. Got a scoop of salted caramel and roasted banana. Really impressed. FYI, there is limited seating inside. Can probably seat ~10 people. There's a fridge inside with pints that you can buy.

Yes, it's really that good. If you're in the area, do not bypass this place. I've had several flavors from here and they've all been delicious. The ice cream is perfect - not too heavy without lacking flavor. The line can get long, especially if it's a nice day, but it's definitely worth the wait. Get a scoop (or two or three) on a sunny day and enjoy it at Dolores Park!

Loooove the honey lavender flavor!  It tasted like actual lavender unlike the artificial flavoring at some places. The lavender scent was very strong and fragrant. I would come back just for honey lavender.  My friend said there was Earl Grey flavor last time she went--I'm waiting for that. I also tried the mango sorbet which tasted like real mango. There was a long line when I went, but line moved fairly quickly. The ice-cream scoopers were super friendly and didn't rush us even though many people were in line behind us.  They let us sample several flavors. Delicious :)

+Salted Caramel +Honey Lavender ($4.25: 2 scoops) The combination of both was like a DREAM; it had the RIGHT amount of saltiness and sweetness without one over powering the other.  I have never been more confident in a mixture of two flavors in my Ice Cream-tasting career.  It's nestled near the corner of the street (perfect for the infamous wrap around line underneath some trees) and is across from Dolores Park! I went on one of the hottest weeks in February. The air smelled of Bi-Rite ice cream, dog dander, sweaty San Franciscans and reefer--a smell that only a true San Franciscan can fully appreciate.

HONESTLY DA BEST. " my favorite flavor hands down is their  "ricanelas " (cinnamon + snickerdoodle!).  No matter what, I always get that flavor. Their Earl Grey flavor is pretty delicious too. So decadent, you can't wipe a smile off my face even if you tried. :)

Best ice cream place hands down. Amazing and creative flavors. This place is worth the trip and the wait. I always have the roasted banana and brown sugar ice cream with chocolate syrup and graham cracker crumbs. Perfect on a warm sunny day while sitting at Dolores park watching the kids dance to awful dub step music, adults trying to walk on a tight rope 12 inches off the ground, watching all the people on fixies riding up and down the street.

There's nothing like ice cream on a cold, San Francisco day. If you're from LA, Bi-Rite is equivalent to Scoops, but just a little better (as proven by the ridiculous hour long lines outside Bi-Rite). -Honey Lavender-- creamy, with a hint of lavendar. Not too overwhelming, not too bland,... my Goldilocks senses approve. This was pretty good, but not as good as the... -Ginger!-- Right? Ginger ice cream is weird! Again, being an LA native, I would say it's equivalent to the Stinking Rose's garlic ice cream = weird, but so, so good!! Ginger tasted great with honey lavender so these two are a great combination :) -Salted caramel-- self explanatory. Again, Goldilocks senses triggered: not too salty, not too sweet, just rite. -Roasted banana-- AMAZING. Have you ever had those toasted banana chips from Trader Joe's? This tastes like that, but in creamy ice cream form. Yes, it's a weird purple color, and no, bananas are not purple... but two wrongs definitely make a rite here. I loved Bi-Rite despite the line, the weather, and the shadiness going on around the bend in Dolores Park. But here's a **TIP-- line up a couple of hours before the sun sets so you can enjoy your ice cream while the sun is still out. No sun + ice cream = no bueno (speaking from the perspective of a brisk February day).

Like you, I've read, heard, and even gazed upon the line for bi-rite creamery. Like you, I have wondered "Really? For ice cream?" Well let me assure you. Yes, dear Lord, yes. Trifecta, could there be a more perfect combination of flavors so lovingly scooped into a cup? Brown sugar, salted caramel, malted vanilla. Could the blissful joy of their tender cone kiss any more sweetly? Nay- I doubt it. I humbly await my wooden spoon.

Hmmm...just about 4300 reviews with an average of 4.5 stars, you know this place gotta be good. It's really hard for me to describe just how good this place is.... It's so good that even though I'm painfully lactose intolerant and was without any lactaid, I still had 4 scoops of ice cream. It's so good that standing in line for what seemed like an hour didn't bother me at all. It's so good that my boy is now working in a sweat shop in Shenzhen making kicks for Nike. (Just kidding son, Dad would never sell you into slavery for ice cream.) It's sad but Hawaii has nothing even close to ice cream like this.  It's so creamy and the flavor combinations are so unique.  True, the line was damn long. It went out the door and stretched WAY around the corner, but it was definitely worth it. Others have told me if you go early on a weekday, then the line is barely anything.  On the weekends though, forget it, be prepared to wait.   The thing I like about Bi-Rite is they don't make things overly sweet so the flavors take the forefront. The flavors we had: *Salted Caramel...OMG, indescribably good. Super rich caramel flavor balanced out perfectly with sea salt.  My favorite here and it's always on the menu. *Roasted Banana...Intense banana flavor with a nice hint of roasted goodness. *Strawberry and Balsamic...Might sound odd but it just works. *Honey Lavender...I had them drizzle blood-orange olive oil on it, amazing *MInt Chip...Good minty flavor. *Toasted Coconut...Intense flavor here too. The flavors here are rotated regularly so check out their website for what flavors they're serving that day.  The seasonal flavors are also a must to try.

Bi-rite Creamery doesn't need me. Doesn't need my business, or my review (4500 and counting). But I'll give em both anyway. They are a bona fide institution and even if they got a 1000 one stars, would still be head and shoulders above almost anything else I've tried. Basically this is a narcissistic review, an excuse for me to pontificate to no one in particular about my experience. So we almost gave up after our first attempt. Parking is cutthroat, no jokes about it. Take a cab, a bus, a horse-and-carriage. Lash a leash to your dog and roller-skate if you must, but don't expect any space within walking distance without a fight. We drove off in defeat. But we came back the next day a bit earlier just to be sure. Glad we did. Parking was only two blocks away, and when we arrived, no line to be seen. It was now or never. We tried a handful of flavors to get a good grip of what they offer. And like the rest of the world, found their Salted Caramel to be super awesome. It reminded me of the See's Candies lollipop caramel flavor; robust and a little bittersweet, almost brulee-ish. Totally different than other caramel flavors I've tried, salted or otherwise. The Orange Cardamom was a close second for me. It popped with citrus and a familiar yet elusive holiday spiciness. Honey Lavender, Earl Grey, and Roasted Banana rounded out the rest. Not a bad one in the bunch. While their flavors aren't Frankenstein-crazy like Humphry-Slocombe (they are maybe a step below Coolhaus creatively) but they nail them to a T. Whatever the flavor is called, it's exponentially realized in ice cream form. Basically the Snozberries taste like Snozberries. Perfectly pure concentrated Snozberries. It's all good, Baby baby. And if you don't know, now you know.

BEST. ICE CREAM. EVER. omg I can't even rave more about this place! I am definitely team Froyo but Bi-Rite is my exception. Whenever I go, I want to sample EVERY flavor. I always try one or two that I was on the fence with, but always end up getting persuaded to get it. For example, I didn't think I would like the roasted banana, but it was so good I had to get a cup of it. Usually I keep it simple and go for dark chocolate and something else, but their unique flavors HAVE to be tried. It's so creamy and smooth. I have had many of their flavors, such as salted caramel, chocolate, mint chip, roasted banana, honey lavender, and cookies and cream. One of my favorites had to be the ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles). I tried this one unexpectedly and fell in love. I never really thought there was a different with brands of ice cream; I thought they were all the same, until I ate here. My friend and I tried the two other big-name ice cream places in SF, but they didn't do the trick. I will only eat ice cream if it's from bi-rite. No more Safeway brand cartons for birthdays, either. It is worth the price and the wait. $3.50 for a single scoop (which is really two scoops) is the perfect amount for a craving.

Salted Caramel Ice Cream! And if you are going to eat it there, the whipped cream is heavenly, so get a Sundae. Service is super awesome. I was inline waiting for these two girls trying every single flavor they have before buying one scoop each. Yet, they are sill so patient and helpful. They also have punch cards so you can get free ice cream later.

I had the biggest and longest craving for ice cream. Told my girlfriend to take me to an ice cream place after dinner... and HOORAY, I LOVE THIS PLACE!! They let you try as many flavors as you'd like. Be considerate for the long line behind you! I love how they give you metal spoons to try different flavors! I ended up getting the salted caramel and orange cardamom. 2 scoops for $3.50! My flavors kind of clashed, but I still enjoyed both while sitting on an old school desk looking table/chair. Used their restroom and got a hold of the whisk key! Also, got to spy on the girl making ice cream in the back! Eek, maybe I shouldn't have spied on her because I saw how much heavy cream was put in that pot! WHO CARES! This place is no place to frown upon the ingredients put into their ice cream! I like how they make all their goodies in the back. My gf knows I'll probably come more often than her, so I got to keep the frequent stamp card :)

So it's my fav time of year.....PUMPKIN TIME!  And it was time to try Bi-Rite's pumpkin At their suggestion, I paired it w/ a scoop of the Brown Sugar & man-oh-man was this just sinfully delish! Thick swirls of brown sugar caramel-toffee-like-thingy & ginger bits to all pair up w/ the creamy light flavored pumpkin. Have to say I think the pumpkin at Mitchells is still my all time fav but this Brown Sugar-Pumpkin combo has me still craving it even weeks later The BF got the Banana & Salted Caramel & he was in heaven.  It was all I could do to part w/ even 1 taste of my combo but I did eventually relinquish & I think he liked mine better - although he wouldn't admit it.   But I could see the look in his wanting eyes.....wanting that Pumpkin & Brown Sugar!  We'll just see what he orders at our next visit.....

Eeehh, not bad....not worth waiting 30 minutes in line but not bad.  If San Francisco had warm summer nights then standing in line for icecream might be fun.  I tried the cookies and cream and mint chip.  The mint chip was almost icy, not good.  The cookies and cream was creamier but still tasted lite. Buy a pint for a much better value and no wait!

This place definitely lives up to the hype and the long line out the door, down the street, and around the corner is justified.  Don't be intimidated by the line; it moves rather quickly. Salted Caramel seems to be one of the most popular and rightfully so and it is DELISH!  I was also able to try out the Roasted Banana, Ginger, and the Brown Sugar to which all are yum. I also like that this place gives you real spoons to sample. Closes at 11pm Fri and Sat night so make sure you stop by for some dessert after dinner.

Wow this place is one the best ice cream I've ever eaten!!! I've heard of this place from many friends and saw that it was top 3 in america online so I just had to come by and try it. Luckily for me it was seasonal time so I got to try their balsamic strawberry. Who would have though to put those flavors together?! It's definitely very unique. Not a fan of balsamic but this one was extremely tasty. Also had the chance to try the brown butter pecan which was amazinggggggg!!! The pecan flavor has a really nice scent to it which smells like they were freshly made. I would definitely come back here many more times but parking is a pain to find too. Next time I'll try their sundaes and maybe get a birthday cake or pie for someone

Waited in line for 25 minutes - they have an organized queue stretching across the block for the typical long lines they get. While in line, I was beginning to wonder if the wait was worth it, or if all the hype was justified... ...until I tried their ice cream. I got a regular (two scoops, reasonably priced at $3.50); one scoop was the ricanelas (cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodles!) and the other was cookies and cream. The ricanelas was unworldly - it was perfect bliss, with the pieces of snickerdoodles highlighting the tastefulness of the cinnamon. The cookies and cream, likewise, was delicious. My friends tried the lavender, salted caramel, strawberry, and more, and all reported similar levels of deliciousness. So yes, worth the wait - the line moves fast, and you'll get some fantastic ice cream at the end!

Why 5 stars?  Because it's still the best ice cream I've ever had in my life.   ---   ---   --- Yes, yes, yes and yes.  Oh, also yes.   You cannot go to San Francisco without a visit to Bi Rite.  It makes sense that it's the most reviewed establishment on Yelp.  What Yelper wouldn't want to go to the Mecca of local business?   Taking the advice of the more than 4,400 reviews, I went with Salted Caramel.  I'm not sure if this is their goal, but it tastes like a Werther's Original in ice cream form.  Absolutely.  Amazing. I also had a blueberry soda, because I was thirsty.  I commend Bi Rite for having a selection of off-beat sodas for me to choose from.  I was thirsty, and one can only drink so much Coke. I did not wait in line more than ten minutes.  I'm not sure how long the lines can get, but there is no wait too long for Bi Rite.  The world would be a happier place if everyone was able to experience the good ole' B.R.C.

The absolute divine nature of the ice cream here has been clearly Yelped about 4410 times before me, so I'm not going to hack at it again.  Bi-Rite.  Try it.  On to more useful information . . . If I could give you some novel advice here it would be to do what I do and bust out an order I like to call the "Party Hat."  Get three scoops of your choosing (plenty of info regarding the best flavors in other reviews below) in a bowl and then put some brownie pieces on that ish.  BUUUT, also order a delicious sugar cone and stick that sucker on top so that your ice cream bowl looks like it's wearing a big ol' hat.  Ice cream cone without the mildly '"first world problems" stress of having to eat all the ice cream before it melts onto your hands.  Party hat.  Party hat in your mouth.  Try it.

This sweet review is dedicated to Timmy S. Knowing i was coming up to SF, i asked many of my Yelp friends for help and suggestions.  Hands down this place received the most recommendations! Life will never be the same... I am not a sweet nor a dessrtaholic. But, i had to try it for myself. The staff is so friendly, full of energy and VERY patient.  We could not make up our minds for the life of us... We made our own sundae http://www.yelp.com/biz_… which consisted of a scoop of toasted coconut. mint  chocolate chip and chocolate coconut . Topped with hot fudge, whipped cream and macadamia nuts. I must say this was THE best sundae I ever had! The depth of each of the flavors were just perfection!  The creaminess just takes you to ice cream heaven!

Evidently, they are famous for the Salted Caramel... I LOVE salted caramel, but was not a fan of this ice cream at all. Instead, I LOVEEEEEED Ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles). It was soooo good. The ice cream is very soft and creamy and delicious.  It was a delicious cinnamon ice cream with little bits of snickerdoodle cookie in it. Very unique and yummy. The staff is very nice and they dont care if you want to try several flavors (as I did). GO HERE.

A creamery that has a line out the door as long as a night club line????!!!! Either something is seriously wrong or seriously right! Lucky for me, something was seriously right. The line was looooong (about 30 ppl in front of me) but it went by quickly. A menu was passed up and down the line and there were a variety of options to choose from. I got a "single scoop" which is actually 2 small scoops of ice cream of different flavors if you want. I listened to fellow Yelper Evonne L.'s  recommendations and went for two of her top flavors: ginger and earl grey. It was DELICIOUS. I was torn because she also said salted caramel and roasted banana were amazing as well but I couldn't stuff down any more food than I had that night. The GINGER was such a pleasant surprise. It was perfectly creamy, slightly sweet, and had a flavorful kick to it. I loved it!   Would definitely wait in line again to try more!

Line is insane, always, no matter the time, no matter the day. But definitely WORTH the wait!! Price is decent for ice cream quality. Their best flavors are salted caramel, chocolate, and cookies a cream!!! SOOOO GOOD, fresh and super tasty!!! DOWNFALL: selection of ice creams is VERY LIMITED!! they have the same 5 flavors over and over and I just wish they had more of a selection or variety depending on the season... I know they expanded the store recently, they could use some of that space to also extend the ice cream counter and selection.

Birite is a small local creamery located in the mission. It's staple is the salted caramel which is a hit with everyone. I sampled a few of their ice creams and all were pretty delicious. I ended up ordering the malted vanilla w/peanut brittle and almonds. Really good. The prices were very reasonable. I would say this spot can get very busy as I was there on a Wednesday at 230pm and there was a line about 5-10min long. If you are in the mission looking for dessert don't hesitate to stop here

Maybe my high expectations as being one of the 7x7 big eats made me think I was going to be mind blown when I had their ice cream. Hmm... not so much. I tried many flavors including the salted caramel but nothing that's making me salivate right now thinking about it. I got malted vanilla which had chunks of peanut brittle and milk chocolate pieces. I like how the pieces were cut finely so it didnt affect the smoothness of the ice cream. The roasted banana was pretty good too but my boyfriend ended up going with earl gray (he's not much of a sweets person). Earl gray was a nice compliment to my malted vanilla because it wasn't as sweet. They DO take card here so that's a plus! There is a nice park across the street that we walked around while we ate our ice cream. The line can look daunting but it moves pretty fast. I would come back though if I was in the area to try one of their sundaes or even their ice cream cakes. I cant help but compare it to ICIs in Berkeley and ICIs has to win because of their chocolate covered cone in the inside. Noms. P.S. Parking can be difficult!

I just had to see for myself what the hype was all about. Best ice cream in the world? So many people have claimed this title, but who actually deserves it?! My friend and I got there at 5:30 pm on a Friday. It was our lucky day because we found parking right in front of Bi-Rite- 2 free hours after 5PM! On top of that, there was no line! I've heard so many raves about their "salted caramel" ice cream. I was hesitant because I never was fond of it when I tried it. I ordered the small size (two mini but good size scoops total) of Earl Grey Tea and the Salted Caramel for $3.50. Boy oh boy, I am wrong. The salted caramel ice cream is to die for! It is not to caramel-saucy and not too sweet. I don't understand but it is just so good! The Earl Grey Tea was good, but I had the Salted Caramel first so the taste overpowered the early grey. They have such unique flavors that I can't wait to come back!

Like everybody else, we came here because of the hype.  And like everybody else, we waited in a long line to get our ice cream.  But unlike everybody else, we don't think this is the BEST ICE CREAM EVER!   We tried a variety of flavors; salted caramel, mint chip, roasted banana, and malted vanilla,  All of the flavors were good, and the quality was obviously very high - all of the flavors were very creamy and rich.  But, this place may not be for you if you prefer classic flavors over these trendy new flavors, Like I said, it's not the best ice cream ever, but It's still good and worth trying.  Personally, I like classic flavors more, so you're more likely to find me at Mitchell's!

Delicious ice cream in interesting flavors, and really friendly staff. But for five bucks and change, I guess I expected more than two golf ball sized scoops. Must be the Mission-Hipster premium. The soft serve window is a different story - the cones are at least average sized, and cost considerably less. I'll stick with the soft serve... not 'cause my middle-aged metabolism needs enormous quantities of ice cream, but because I don't like the feeling of being chumped.

This was a a great treat to have after wandering the city on a warm sunny day. Had a scoop each of the orange cardamom and earl grey ice creams. A little tea-like theme, but it was really good. I did try the salted caramel, but that stuff was intense and sweeter than I was hoping (I wanted more salt). Had a bite of my friend's tangerine sorbet which was fresh and light, reminding me a little of my favorite sorbet place in DC - Pitango. The line was long and around the corner, but with all the people watching you're doing, the wait is bearable.

We walked a few miles to make it to this hot spot.  So of course rewarded ourselves with several scoops. I had the salted caramel and vanilla with homemade fudge sauce!  AMAZING. We also brought home of the burnt caramel sauce and it also super tasty. This is a must in SF!

If I lived next to Bi-Rite Creamery, I'm almost certain I'd be on my way to diabetic concerns. Luckily I'm a bit further away than "just down the street" from this sweet sensation. If you're a fro yo fan, and you like salted caramel, go to Bi-Rite on a Sunday or Monday, in which their fro yo lines offer the ever-popular flavor, in yogurt form. If you're in the mood for a little something extra, go for the "Lazy Sundae" on Sundays - salted caramel fro yos with chocolate sauce and graham cracker bits. It's definitely enough for two, and a good bang for your buck at $5. Willing to hold out and bear the over-thirty-minute wait? Go the ice cream route. Or navigate the system and check out the fro yo line, or buy a pint of the good stuff - honey lavender, earl gray, or salted caramel - whatever flavor you choose to savor.

Mmmmmm. I would stand in line in the rain again, any day. Bi-rite is just that good. The females ordered 3 flavors each so I was able to sample 12 different flavors and they were all great! Some must try's: salted caramel, Earl grey, and honey lavender. A word to the wise: don't be intimidated by the line. It moves rather quickly. Your patience will be handsomely rewarded. Trust. No frills. Just really good ice cream.

Ok ok first off yes it was delicious. But it wasn't so hot. I think the hype helps it a bit. The people at ther service counter were all awesome though. They were always ready to help and give a taste and take your time, which I know some might not like considering the line can get fairly long but you really do need to try out the flavors to appreciate what you would like. Ok for the ice cream, its rich and creamy and delicious. And though I am just not a dessert or sweet kind of guy it was very delicious but personally I really enjoyed Humphry Slocombe a great deal more. As in surprised I could ask for it again. And I have also tried the   Penny Ice Creamery so ive given them all a good whirl and still I preferred Humphry for my calories.

The crazy ice-cream line says it all. Flavors to die for. Stop thinking, just get in line, you won't regret it. Is it a hipster thing? Not at all, just don't listen to them. Once you're in line, get your instinct working. What flavors do you want? What's good? Here's the hint: ALL THE FLAVORS ARE AMAZING! It just depends on what mood you're in and what are you craving most! With me, I'll go with the medium triple flavors of : Salted Caramel, Roasted Banana and Honey Lavender. Sometimes even Salted Caramel x 3, because often times I felt like I needed just a little more of the salted caramel. I'll continue this soon. Ima get myself some ice cream.

Just to let you know, I did NOT want to try this place... mostly because this place seems waaaaayy too overhyped and because of my love for Fenton's (felt like I was cheating on my favorite Oakland creamery).   But my girl dragged me here... and I'm glad she did.  I was a little hesitant at first because everyone knows parking is a BITCH in this area and this place is supposed to have Disneyland-like lines.   But as soon as I laid my taste buds upon that soft, creamy, single size... I hopped up on the bandwagon like a 2010 SF Giants fan!  I chose a flavor mix of Roasted Banana and Brown Sugar... crazy good.   Yessir, I am a Bi-Rite fan and will be back in that line soon...

I'm updating my review to 4 stars!! It took me some time to get used to the flavors here. I can admit, I may have not gotten the best flavors when I first came here. I learned to sample the ice cream & to choose the ones closest to "normal." I really really like this place! Mitchell's is still my #1 & the Joe's in Richmond District, but BiRite is also up there. I like how they have places to sit outside. It's always nice to people watch & eat your ice cream. I think I'll stop by tomorrow to get my fix. =)

Tip #1: My friend and I learned this lesson. If you are going to get a pint, you do not need to wait in line. Walk straight into the store and go to the register. My friend and I waited 15-20 minutes in line. When we got inside, we decided it'd be more worth it to just get a pint. That was when we saw the sign about waiting. We got the Malt, Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate flavor. I could taste each single element in the ice cream at different times but it didn't really come together as a single flavor to me. It just felt like I was eating those three different things and if that was the case, I'd really rather have a box of peanut brittle in my hand than tiny pieces of it in ice cream. The ice cream however was really creamy. You could tell that the quality was good. And even as someone who doesn't like ice cream, the creaminess was pretty addicting. I found myself eating more than I normally would, which is only about a taste or two.

Did you know there was a bi-rite MARKET!! totally missed the creamery cuz i saw Bi-Rite and i was like oo theres teh ice cream shop...so moded It was pretty busy when i got there on the nice sunny Sunday, yes the rare occasion that it is nice and sunny in SF....the line moves pretty quick so no need to wait forever. Everyone raves about the Salted Caramel but i got me cookies and cream and honey lavender. I also tasted the Brown Sugar with ginger and something else, and that one was really good cuz you get the brown sugar but not overwhelmingly and i did not taste the ginger AT ALL, which i like =) The honey lavender was a little overpowering on the lavender part....kinda to the point of not liking it, so no honey lavender for me next time...but i love cookies and cream and this one was just right.!  Not too heavy on the cream and just the right ratio of cookies =)

FOUR STARS?  Yes, sorry I can't give it more, blame my lactose intolerance.  Though I give them four stars since they do have some good non-lactose options!  I tried some of their ice cream as well, and it's pretty good, but I just can't rate it fairly. I only went once, but I've been warned of some large crowds, but the night I came here, it was all clear.  So... aim for the weekday evening visits I guess!

I don't get what the big hoop-la is about. The flavors sounded very interesting and unique and I wanted to sample some having no idea what they would taste like but couldn't becuase it was busy and people were pushing around you so I managed to squeeze in a sample of balsamic strawberry, tasted like plain strawberry. So I got a scoop of salted carmel and honey lavender or something like that. The ice cream tastes fine, nothing to write home about of to make the drive out to get it again. And it was too fluffy for my taste and melted wayyyy too fast. And it was cold outside that day. In all honesty a block and half and it was melted.

Lord have mercy that was some damn good ice cream! I wasn't sure what to expect but upon walking toward the place seeing the velvet rope outside I knew I was in for a treat. An ice cream place that gets a line like a club? Must be good right? Hell yes! I had the Salted Caramel and the Brown Sugar with burned Caramel swirls. I was in Caramel heaven. Seriously delicious ice cream and great service too. Although I didn't try any samples you can pretty much get samples of anything you want. The place is a little small inside, so the line outside makes a little more sense but even if it was huge I'd still assume there would be a line out the door. It's that good!

I think the 4000+ reviews speak for themselves.  I'm just adding to the noise. Bi-Rite has wonderfully unique flavors, most of which taste as delicious (or even more so) than they sound. My favorite was definitely the Ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles).  I'm a big fan of cinnamon, so go figure. Brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl was also very tasty.  The caramel added a nice texture to it. Pumpkin was only ok.  I've had better pumpkin-flavored ice cream. Salted caramel was good, but tasted a little burnt to me.  I think that's what they're going for, and it didn't bother me much.  I wouldn't have minded eating a whole scoop of it, for sure. I wasn't a fan of honey lavendar, though.  Tasted kind of like soap.  Maybe my ice cream taste buds just aren't sophisticated enough. Overall, excellent ice cream - definitely worth a visit (or more).

I honestly don't get the hype of this place. Went here for dessert the other day. It was raining so the store was completely dead. The workers were super friendly and willing to let us sample whatever flavors we wanted. Sampled the Salted Caramel and wasn't too impressed. Had a hint of a smokey flavor which I liked, other than that it was just "meh" could have used a tad more salt and more predominant caramel flavor.  I felt like Humphry Slocombe had a better Salted Caramel than this place. I ended up getting the Malted Vanilla (which came with peanut brittle) and the Roasted Banana. The Roasted Banana was my favorite out of all the flavors I tried, however like all the other Ice Creams I tried the flavor didn't really POP. Definitely could have used more bananas. Don't get me wrong it was pretty good, but nothing I'd go out of the way for (so far my favorite Ice Cream place seems to be ICI). Would be interested in trying the Sams Sundae if in the area though (= (Ps. The Hot Fudge is not Hot, but still good =p )

Who doesn't like ice cream? But...have you ever had gourmet ice cream? The flavors here are unique, hand crafted and organic where possible. Many of their ingredients are also sourced from local farms and businesses, so you can feel good about eating lots of this stuff. The service was super friendly and patient allowing you to sample anything. I tried a few of the flavors, but at the recommendation of many decided to go with a scoop of the salted caramel. It had a bitter, salty, and sweet taste all at once. Delicious! I also had a scoop of the brown butter pecan which was a little creamier, sweeter but just as you'd expect butter and pecans to taste - incredible! There's usually one hell of a line around the block but at 8pm on a Monday night in the middle of winter, there were only 5 people ahead of me. You can only pray for parking around here so good luck! So worth the drive and the wait at anytime!

Bi-Rite Creamery is one of the best ice cream places in the bay - hands down, everything lived up to the hype for me.  Ice cream texture and flavors are as good as Ici in Berkeley.  Although Ici has better cones, Bi-Rite is cheaper, offering two flavors for the price of one serving. We didn't wait in line for very long and almost all of the flavors were still in stock (take that, Humphry Slocombe!).  I ordered a scoop of honey lavender and ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles).  My sister ordered salted caramel and toasted coconut.  Everything was amaaaaaaaaze.  The ice cream texture is rich, creamy, and reminds you exactly why ice cream is infinitely better than frozen yogurt.  The flavors are beautifully subtle - the honey lavender was one of the best variations of a floral flavor that I've ever had. I am only sad that I didn't try Bi-Rite sooner.  I can't wait to return to try their sundaes.

The ladies behind the counter were nice as well~ Ice cream was definitely not over-frozen, but just right! I also got to try a bit of the Earl Gray ice cream, and it was pretty amazing. Even if you are not getting it as your scoop, at least try it!

The ice cream here is of very good quality, and the staff is pretty nice about giving you samples (they should really switch to plastic spoons..when I went they were using metal ones. it slows the line down). Overall, I'm impressed with their unique selection of flavors - although they are on the girly side. I got the ricanelas, which is a snickerdoodle flavored Ice Cream. Delicious! Good thing there was no wait when I went, because I think I'd be let down if I waited more than 20mins. Maybe I'm saying this because I had this right after I had Ike's... Anyway, would I come again? I'd check it out if i were in the area, because no doubt the ice cream is top notch, but would only go in if there was a small line...i would recommend the same if you're not an ice cream fanatic.

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory? NOOOO.... It's..... CHENA AND THE ICE CREAM FACTORY! It was every kid's dream to enter the one and only Bi-Rite Creamery. Bi-Rite: A place where magical ice cream exists. You definitely can't try the flavors they have here anywhere else. Hence, the magic of it. Of course, being the big eater I am, I got the triple scoop in a cup. Salted Caramel: 2 stars. I am not going to say this is WAY over hyped because analogous to one's taste in guys, everyone has their own taste in ice cream. I definitely did not like this flavor because it was awfully bitter and tasted like overly burnt butterscotch. BUT that's just me. I like sweet ice cream. However, many people do like this flavor so you should taste it first and see if you like it! White Chocolate Raspberry: 4.5 stars. Just the right kinda guy-- i mean ice cream for me. It's what it sounds like, Raspberry and White chocolate. absolutely delicious. Brown Sugar: 4 stars. What more can I say? Tastes like brown sugar! It can be compared to Haagen Dazs' Dulce De Leche if you have tried that before. Pretty good, and sweet like I like it! Ricanelas: 3 stars. I personally don't like cinnamon, so it was not the flavor for me! However, my friend LOVED it because she likes cinnamon, so if you are one of them cinnamon lovers, TRY IT! My total came out to $6.25 I have yet to try the cookies and cream, mint chocolate chip, and coffee toffee, but my friends had it and they LOVED it. So I think you cant go wrong here. Just pick what you like and it will be delicious. They let you sample, so just choose whatever your heart desires! I heard about this place's long lines, so I did what I did best: come at awkward times! I came on Tuesday around 2:45pm. It was a 10 minutes wait, but much better than the "hourly" wait! Parking is quite difficult! It's mostly street parking, so if you are lucky, you will find a spot. If not, circle around. TRY THIS IF YOU EVER CAN TO EXPERIENCE THE MYSTICAL BI-RITE CREAMERY.

Great, creamy ice cream! I don't know how/why it took me so many years to discover it, but finally, I can say, I've tried it!  Fortunately, for going on a Monday afternoon around 5pm, I didn't have to wait in line for more than 20 minutes. Although I know their Salted Caramel flavor is what their known for, I decided to try their Toasted Coconut and Meyer Lemon.  Both were great flavors, and who would have thought that the two would make a good combination together. Since I didn't have the Salted Caramel in the store, I did take a pint home.  For the future, I would recommend bringing a cooler if you're going to have a long drive home.  Salted Caramel, in general, is a softer ice cream and doesn't freeze solid, so by the time I got home, an hour later, it was quite soft.  It re-froze well, but we weren't able to enjoy it at it's peak consistency that night. I can't wait to try all of their other flavors!

I waited in line for 30 minutes, and I was not left disappointed. I got the Dainty Gentleman, which was perfection - honey lavender ice cream drizzled with blood orange olive oil, sea salt, and hot fudge. I would've never thought to combine these ingredients together, but it was truly amazing, the best ice cream I've had to date. We also picked up a quart of the salted caramel, just because it was so highly rated on yelp. It was a sinfully delicious treat to have at home, and made me wish we had some of their hot fudge to drizzle on top ourselves. The lines suck, but the end result is so worth it!

Bi-Rite Creamery, where have you been all of my life? It's rare to find a cuisine void in Chicago, but two recent vacations shined a light on the fact that Chicago is seriously lacking in the artisan ice cream market. Sure, we have a few homemade ice cream places and the gelato trend is booming, but we lack the small-batch inventive ice cream flavors I've encountered elsewhere. I didn't need to read any Yelp reviews to know Bi-Rite Creamery was special; on my first attempt at ice cream, the lines for regular and soft serve were bananas; stretching down the street and around the corner! Not having the time or patience to brave the line, we decided to return on a weekday (pro move - almost no waiting). The sizing is a little unusual, but promotes maximum flavor tasting. A single gets you 1-2 flavors, a double 2-3, and a triple 3-4 flavors. Despite this, it's still really hard to narrow down your choices - everything sounds good and they provide a few staff combos to really throw your brain into a tizzy. On my first visit, I ordered a double - brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl and malted vanilla with peanut brittle and chocolate. It was fabulous, I gobbled it up like it was the last supper. The flavors complimented each other nicely, but my clear favorite was the brown sugar - sweet, but not overly so and so creamy! My friend got a double with coffee toffee and the famed salted caramel. While delicious, decadent and reminiscent of caramel corn, I'm not sure I could handle a whole scoop of salted caramel. Once I was bitten by the Bi-Rite bug, I plotted my return before heading home, I was haunted by all of those untasted flavors. A little obsessed, I actually jogged from my hotel to Bi-Rite and back. Since I was working on my fitness, I didn't feel guilty going with a triple - honey lavender, ginger, and maple walnut. Again, the ice cream didn't disappoint; rich and dreamy, I devoured it. This time, my favorite was the ginger, closely followed by the maple walnut. If you're visiting SF, plan a visit to Bi-Rite Creamery - you won't be disappointed. If you're a local and haven't tried it yet, go...now!

I've lived in SF my whole life, but have never gone here until the other day. I wish I found this place earlier! I got their salted caramel and early grey ice cream. Everyone raves about their salted caramel, but I feel like it's nothing extraordinary. But don't get me wrong, it was good. I also took a pint of salted caramel home for my family, and they all loved it. I personally liked the earl grey a lot better! It wasn't too strong, but you could taste the early grey. I wish I bought a pint of this one too! Do get ready to wait in a line no matter what day you go. I went on a random weekday and there was a long line to wait in. Although I did beat the crowd by just a few minute. Parking is also not the best in that area. Might take some time to find parking. =/

Hours after running a half marathon and burning 1400 calories, I decided to reward myself with ice cream at Bi-Rite Creamery.  My cousin wasn't as enthusiastic but was game after she found out they had a vegan flavor called chocolate coconut.  So we hopped on the bus from Union Square and headed down to the Mission district in search of this famous ice cream place.  You see, Bi-Rite has the distinction of being the most reviewed business on Yelp.  It was also featured on Food Network's The Best Thing I Ever Ate.  I'm sure there are countless articles and news clippings I can dredge up but the point is, they serve up some delicious ice cream and are always busy.   We walk by and there's a huge line.  We decided to get a drink at the nearby bar and have dinner before rounding back to get dessert.  By the time we head back, the line was just as long as it was when we had walked by earlier.  There's a slew of flavors.  Most of the flavors are gourmet like balsamic strawberry, salted caramel, pumpkin, or honey lavender.  There are the lactose free flavors like chocolate coconut and melon sorbet.  But then there are the sundaes.  Sam's sundae was particularly interesting to me because it was the sundae that was featured on the Food Network.  It features chocolate ice cream, bergamot olive oil, Maldon sea salt & whipped cream.  But I decided to taste a few flavors before making up my mind.  The cool thing is they give you metal spoons for tasting and wash them for reuse.  Way to go!   I tried the balsamic strawberry, pumpkin and honey lavender flavors.  I was sold on honey lavender and ordered the Dainty Gentleman sundae: 2 scoops honey lavender ice cream, blood orange olive oil, Maldon sea salt, and hot fudge.  The spoons and containers are eco-friendly!  Let me just tell you, this sundae will change your life!  It was a flavor explosion and was so delicious I didn't mind eating the ENTIRE thing.  The combination of chocolate & sea salt with the citrusy olive oil along with the honey lavender ice cream was AMAZING.  You will just have to go try it or create your own.  Bi-Rite is simply delicious ice cream and I'm so happy I was able to try it.

Bi-Rite Creamery is a Must when you're in SF. They've got so many reviews, they really don't need mine, but I'll put in my 2 cents anyways. Some of the flavors sound funky as hell ("Honey Lavender? Why would I want to eat a flower? Balsamic Strawberry? I want ice cream, not a salad."), but in actuality, the funkier the name, the more flavorful and delicious the ice cream. So go ahead, be ballsy, and pick an unexpected one. They're all amazing in their own right. You can't go wrong! While I have yet to try them all (I'm workin on it), some of my favs (besides the aforementioned HL and BS) are: Salted Caramel, Toasted Coconut, Ginger, and Coffee Toffee. Annnd now I'm drooling. :-P...

It's a cold night in San Francisco (when is it not a cold night in SF?) and I had heard so much about Bi-Rite that I was determined to try it, regardless of the fact that I had the shivers already.   There was a line outside when we arrived and I was told that the line was particularly short for Bi-Rite.  I had a hard time choosing flavors. So many were unique: lavendar honey, cinnamon with cookies, creme fraiche, etc.  I felt a little rushed ordering because of the herd of people behind me, but I ended up trying the creme fraiche and cinnamon with snickerdoodles. It is definitely some solid ice cream.  They had toppings and sundaes and I didn't realize that until after I had ordered, but next time I'll definitely try one!

This place is absolutely amazing, I've only walked by here a few times and even looked in to see the flavors they offered (which tend to be unique and sometimes exotic). There is almost always a line and I always looked over this place cause it's usually when I'm on the way to Tartine or Benny Gold. It wasn't until this place was mentioned on Top 10 places in US on Yelp that I decided it was finally time to try it out. It was a cold Monday so there wasn't a line but there were still people in and out buying ice cream. My friend and I shared a single scoop of honey lavender and orange cardamon. The ice cream is amazingly smooth and the flavors are absolutely delicious. There's no point in even trying to explain how it tastes besides that it must be a sin to have tasted something so good. We even sampled the earl grey which tasted exactly like we expected, not some artificial flavor you sometimes get from other shops. Even though we shared the single scoop, we were both extremely satisfied and felt we had enough. Though we wouldn't mind to get some more. This place definitely lives up to its hype and for a single scoop (which is basically two scoops because the kids is only a single scoop) for 3.50, I think I can say this is the best place for ice cream. I've had Ici's, Mitchell's, Fentons, and Smitten. Bi-Rite beats them all overall for taste, price, value and selection (that doesn't mean those place are bad either!). Put this on your must try list, you won't regret it. 4000+ reviews at 4.5 stars says it all. Note: I also had Cool Haus in Los Angeles but I felt it wasn't fair to compare them due to location difference as well as Cool Haus making their selling point in ice cream sandwiches out of a truck.

Wow that is good ice cream, and not a bad price, 3 scopes for $5 I would recommend Coffee Toffee, Salty Caramel!! Best of all we chanced across it with a line of only 10 people, sometimes it is half way around the world!! I LOVE ICE CREAM :)

I would drink tea every day for the rest of my life if it was actually Bi-Rite's Earl Grey ice cream. Then again, I would eat anything from Bi-Rite every day, for the rest of my life. Actually, after standing in line for 20 minutes and scarfing down our ice creams on a bench outside the shop, everyone I was with seriously considered getting back in line and doing it all over again. It was that awesome. All of it. It doesn't really matter what you order, it only matters that you order. You will not regret it.

Wow this place is popular! Loooong line out the door.  Right next door is where Bi-Rite sells their frozen yogurt and other baked goods.  Also quite a line.   Tried the salted caramel and honey lavender.  The salted caramel had a very strong taste.  It was personally a little too sweet and overindulgent for me, but I can see why it's so popular.  The honey lavender tasted slightly weird at first, but the taste grows on you after awhile.  I love how they sell their various ice cream flavors in pints & quarts to take home.  The shop itself is also cute and the servers are patient in helping you figure out what flavor you'd like.  I'd go back to try other flavors and the fro-yo next door.

The line was long but it went by really fast and we didn't have to wait too long. The salted caramel was everything that I hoped and wished for. It was the BEST ice cream that I've ever tasted. I will wait in line a lot longer for that! Anyone going there has to try this. The balsamic strawberry was good but didn't have much of the balsamic taste. I would've prefer more. The roast banana was like eating a roasted banana. Good but not great though. A bit too sweet for my taste. The toasted coconut was really good. That I will wait for too. The toffee coffee was yummy with the bits of toffee. Kinda wished it came w/ bits of coffee beans too. Didn't have any toppings on my ice cream. Wanted the original tastes. But they do offer quite a few choices. I will definitely be waiting in line again.

After a spoonful of the malted vanilla, I forgot I stood in line for over 20 minutes.   After my next spoonful of the salted caramel, I forgot what ice cream tasted like. After having another spoonful of coffee toffee, I forgot I was on earth.   Yes, I got three scoops, I need to take my inner fat child to therapy now!

Bi-Rite Creamery is definitely the spot to check out if one is seeking a bold and intense ice cream flavors. Came here with a friend and we both tried the salted caramel and strawberry vinegarette. Let's just say we both truly enjoyed it. It was definitely different from the other ice creams because of its richness in flavors. Trust me when I say the wait is worth it because after Bi-Rite other ice creams just taste alright. Definitely looking forward to coming back and trying out other flavors. I highly recommend this place.

Having only been here on a Tuesday, I had the fortune of skipping the weekend hour lines. My friend and I were both not fans of salted caramel so we had the Ricanelas and the peanut butter one (forgot what it was called). The Ricanelas was the best tasting ice cream I have ever had. However, I would have the $ rating at at least $$, because $3 for a small scoop of ice cream isn't cheap.

I have recently revisited Bi-Rite, Humphrey Slocombe, and Mitchell's and I feel I must update my previous 4-star review of Bi-Rite ice cream to 5 stars.  Bi-Rite's scoops are slightly larger than Humphrey Slocombe's, and they allow you to get two flavors in a Single, unlike Mitchell's.  Not to mention that Bi-Rite's sea salt caramel is hands down my favorite ice cream in SF.   They also have excellent customer service.  I brought an out of town guest there and the girl behind the counter waited patiently while she sampled one flavor.  I said my favorite flavor was the sea salt caramel and without asking, the girl offered her a sample of that too.  When she still couldn't make up her mind, the girl said you're welcome to try more!  Finally, after 3 samples, a decision was made.

It's good - balsamic strawberry is delicious, the earl grey - your taste buds will be happy, but I continue to have a love hate relationship with this place. I can't argue that the ice cream isn't good, but with the hassle the incremental goodness goes down. Is it worth going out of my way to find parking in the mission, then wait in a line that's snaked around the corner and then down the street, and then wonder if I have a parking ticket on my car by the time I get my ice cream? possibly not...

came here a couple weekends ago, very nice sunny Saturday afternoon in SF. saw a big line that stretched around the corner of the building, but heck, it was hot, so it was time for ice cream. didn't mind the wait bc i was in good company and there was some event where they were playing some music and trying to sell some pies from some nearby store so it was entertaining. got the salted caramel sundae, shared w/ 2 friends, very delicious flavors!!! SO GOOD~!!! just try it! i never had salted caramel flavored ice cream and i have to say it was BOMB!!!

Every time we've passed Bi-Rite, my boyfriend always tried to tell me the history and how great it was, pointing out the line that is forever present outside even in the winter. I never paid much attention, because I mean, how different could Bi-Rite possibly be from any other ice cream place I've ever been to? I was wrong. Best ice cream EVER. I need to try all the flavors, because just when I think I've had the best, the next one tops it. They have seasonal flavors, vegan options, ice cream sandwiches, cakes, pies, popsicles, sundaes, and the shelves are lined with gourmet fudge, caramel, cookies and cocoa that would make great gifts! I can't wait to come her win the summer. It will be the perfect cold treat on a hot day (or any day, really.)

Can I please give this place at least an extra star or two? I haven't been in a while, but Bi-Rite Creamery is absolutely, hands-down my FAVORITE place in the entire universe. The long lines that you see stretching down the block should give you a hint as to how amazing this place is. The honey lavender and salted caramel flavors make my heart sing. Even just the thought of them makes me choke up and do a quick Orbitz search for one of those mistake fares you hear about sometimes. It's not cheap, but for what you get, it is the best value anywhere. No trip, I repeat, NO TRIP to San Francisco is complete without parking your fanny in line and getting some ice cream from Bi-Rite.

You know when people talk something up so much and then you go try it out for yourself and it just isn't that good? This was definitely not one of those times! The range of ice creams and the imagination involved in the flavours is unbelievable! I tried the salted caramel, chocolate coconut, banana and earl grey and it was the best ice cream to have ever graced my taste buds.

Salted caramel is DELICIOUS DELICIOUS DELICIOUS.  When i got to Bi Rite, there was NO line (YAY!!!)  I figured there usually is a line because they had ropes out side of the store (kind of like at the clubs :P).  The place is really small and quaint.  Cute place and it looks family owned.   For a single scoop i believe it was 3.75?  Somewhere around there.  But totally worth it.  The salted caramel was my favorite.  It  tasted like caramel popcorn!  And it wasn't overly sweet.  Definitely could see myself eating a whole tub of this baby.   We also got the ricanelas!  This was definitely interesting but in a good way! workers were really nice great customer service and great ice cream!!  I will definitely be coming back to try other flavors!!

My husb chose to introduce me to Bi-Rite since he was convinced, after 3 of 3 fantastic experiences, that I would love it. He chose a day that we were in the Mission, a cold and blustery day where most people were probably slurping ramen somewhere in Japantown. That means: a short line at Bi-Rite. He wanted Bi Rite to start off on a good note with me, since I. Hate. Waiting. In. Lines. Unfortunately for him, I found the ice cream underwhelming. Now: there's good flavor selection and plenty of pros to this cute ice cream shop: - clear signs of what is gluten free, vegan (there's a coconut based vegan ice cream - our day was chocolate coconut - as well as a sorbet option) - lots of gourmet flavors (salted caramel: can't go wrong; and of course, something with lavender and/ or cardamom) - free tastes before commitment - lots of sizes available: kiddy, single, double, and $7 sundaes if you're like me and enjoy your ice cream complicated - a relatively fast-moving line - small area to eat indoors, with a big water fountain and a restroom So why I won't be returning - I found the ice cream... not special. It wasn't creamy or memorable. The flavors were good but didn't stand out. Texture was mediocre. Maybe I got wind of a bad ice cream batch. I dunno. Plus, the baked goods were far better to look at than to eat. I had a sweet & salty peanut cookie that was crispy and bland. Neither sweet nor salty. More like a biscuit. At least it was cheap (75 cents). Well, it was worth a shot. And it's still cheaper than Ici, 'though not by much.

LOVE THIS PLACE! Can't believe I never reviewed it before :) I was back in San Francisco for a few days last week and I was so pleased to be able to do one of my absolute favourite things - get some birite ice-cream and enjoy every luscious mouthful in beautiful Dolores Park. (I miss you San Francisco!) I had my two favourites, salted caramel & brown sugar ice cream and my third scoop was roasted coconut. The staff here are always absolutely lovely and super friendly.

My boyfriend surprised me by taking me here for some ice cream. We got there at a good time, because soon after the line doubled behind me. The ice cream was definitely worth it. Best salted caramel that I've ever had. I had the home made almond toffee on top and it was the perfect combination. My boyfriend ordered cookies and cream with hot fudge sauce. His was good, but mine was better. After he finished his scoop, he stared at my bowl with sad eyes until I finally felt bad and let him have the last few bites. The only thing I regret is not getting a bigger size. Kids size scoop is not enough.Oh, and If you are looking for a place to eat your ice cream, there is a beautiful park right next to the store!

4209 reviews.....not much more to add!! Their ice cream is awesome. People are friendly and they let you sample the flavors with a smile! Ice cream is very flavorful. Loved the Roasted Banana, Malted Vanilla with Brown Sugar. Not a big fan of the most popular Salted Carmel... it was too rich for me. But all the other flavors I tried were awesome!! The place smelled so good from all the some they were baking. And the price was very reasonable... $3.25 for a single which is two flavor scoops. Just go!

The salted caramel is the BEST here.  Not too salty.  Not too sweet.   I wasn't as impressed with their other flavors.  I sampled the honey lavender, coffee, and ginger.  All three were just a-okay.   Parking is hard to find here, so come on a weekday.

I think this place is a bit overhyped. I was lucky to find parking right in front of the store on one of my trips here (of course after having to circle the block about 10 times) AND the line was short - about a 5 minute wait.  But on most occasions, there's a line wrapped around the building unless you get lucky like me! I got the salted caramel on a cone which tasted eh, funky. But don't get me wrong - it's not that bad! They're cool with giving out samples which is always a plus! Their scoop is literally half the size of a typical ice cream scoop. This place is super tiny with very limited seating.  They have outdoor seating as well and a park directly across the street which is nice to hang out at on a sunny day. The staff is very friendly and patient with indecisive customers like myself. I would definitely make a trip back here if I'm ever venturing in the area!

I love Bi-Rite. So much. I would recommend the salted caramel (ALL TIME FAVE.. people are not lying when they say that its hella good) and the toasted vanilla. I would skip the Honey Lavender... the flavor is what I would imagine a candle to taste like, lol... There is usually a line but it moves quickly! And the people that work here are super friendly. Tons of street parking outside.

Had the Earl grey ice cream scoop. I loved that it tastes just like tea, I sampled the lavender and felt like it tasted too much like flowers. Too high a quality for my taste buds. Thought it was cool that they let you sample everything on spoons, go slightly environmentally friendly! Very friendly staff, I would definitely go back or recommend it to a friend.

I'm not a big fan of flower-favored ice cream because it makes me feel like I'm eating potpourri, but Bi-Rite makes a wicked honey lavender ice cream that balances both! The initial taste gives you the sweet lavender, and then the light honey aspect hits you near the end of your first bite! The salted caramel is too rich for me. Their cookies n cream flavor was a bit disappointing -- I'm a HUGE cookies and cream fanatic, so I would've preferred more oreos/crunch to it, and less cream. I also liked their malted vanilla though -- it has a nice crunch with the brittle! Tip: The junior/kid size is ONE scoop= one flavor, their normal size is TWO scoops!

This is my favorite ice cream place in sf, with Humphrey Slocomb being a close second. The ice cream texture is perfect, not as dense as Smitten ice cream, and not as smothering as gelato. When one digs in, you could easily get a perfect spoonful with a flaky texture (the side almost looks like the side of a volcanic divide). Coffee toffee and mint chip flavors are fantastic!

I've considered Bi-Rite like a celebrity to me. My palms were sweaty and my tummy had butterflies the night we decided to finally go try it. Wow. I get it. I totally get it. Here are some of my favorites: Burned Bananas - I wish the filling of banana cream pies could taste like this German chocolate - Exactly what I need for a chocolate fix Orange Cardamom - Something that my mom would make, strong cardamom taste with a hint of orange. Divine and genius Salted Caramel - what they are known for. Delicious, but I definitely couldn't do a whole scoop of it I can't wait to go back and try the rest!!!

Finally got around to trying this ice cream everyone talks about! In my book, it's really a 4 star, but it saved my SF trip from being a disaster after a super disappointing meal, so I bumped it up to 5. Came here on Sunday to try to get it, but the line was ridiculously long so I opted to make the experience more dramatic by prolonging the wait. Came here again at 6pm on a Thursday night, and yay not a single person in line! Weekdays are magical for these popular places. Sampled the salted caramel I keep reading about, but the taste was a bit too intense for me. Shared a single scoop with the Earl Grey and the Honey Lavender with the bf for $3.50. A bit pricey considering the dinky size of the scoops, but I guess for unique flavors and the ultra smooth texture, it's worth it? The Earl Grey was delicious! At first I couldn't taste it, but then I realized that they had JUST the right amount of tea flavor. The flavor is ridiculously light, but it's strong enough for you to taste. I wish boba places could make their Earl Grey Milk Tea's as smooth as Bi Rite makes their ice cream. Sigh. A girl can hope. The Honey Lavender was pretty good. I probably wouldn't get it next time, but I just wanted to try different flavors since it was my first visit, and probably only for a while. I guess I'm not much of a fan of lavender, because I know I had Lavender Milk Tea once and wasn't too impressed. (Sorry for comparing everything to boba, but that's the only thing I have to go on.) Walked across the street to Dolores Park afterwards to eat our dessert. I like the ice cream+park combo. You get to walk off some of the calories you're ingesting. Pints are $7, which if you think about it is an extremely great deal since that only gets you 2 single scoops. The shop is extra small, but the servers are extra nice. I'll definitely come back whenever I'm craving some Earl Grey!

Absolutely the best ice cream ever. Hands down. Bi-rite's ice cream is creamy and smooth, encompassing flavors for both an adult and child's palette; and, I guess, any adult that wants to be a kid again. I go to school in Pittsburgh, and there is a pretty decent ice cream place there. All of my friends rave about that ice cream, and I guess I pay lip service to that. But I will take Bi-rite's ice cream to my grave.

This place has been on my to go to list ever since I moved to the city.  I've seen pictures and checkins from friends, so I finally went. Cute, quaint little creamery.  Reminds me a lot of Ici Ice Cream in Berkeley.  Got the kiddie malted vanilla ice with toffee almond bits.  YUMMMMMMM to the toffee.  The ice cream didn't really do it for me.  Maybe I should have tried more flavors but I definitely was in LOVE with their toffee!!! It wasn't too hard and had this soft/brittle texture.  Yum.  Not sure if I'd go back for the ice cream but I'll definitely be back for the toffee!!!

One year and two visits later, I figured it was time to finally write this - never mind that I only took a bite the second time around though! I'll keep this (relatively) short though, given how many people have written about Bi-Rite already. Their flavors, while fairly traditional (with the likes of chocolate, vanilla, butter pecan, salted caramel), are very good: strong, but not overly so, and quite tasty. Rich and very creamy, their ice cream is somewhat reminiscent of frozen custard. Not inherently a bad thing, but one must be in the mood for something like this. Lines at night tend can be intimidating, but, as long as people aren't taste-testing every flavor, it actually moves fairly quickly. Alternatively, show up earlier in the day when there's almost no line - nothing wrong with a bit (or a lot) of ice cream in the middle of the day! The venue itself is accessible, but requires a bit of finagling to get in and out of, due to the single queue pole that essentially cuts the width of the entrance door in half. $3.20 or so will land you a single, with two scoops (of different flavors, if you so choose). Personally, I'm more likely to go to Humphry than Bi-Rite, but this is mostly due to the fact that they have more unique flavors than Bi-Rite does, and is also a bit lighter (so one can eat more!)

I came here at the suggestion of a friend who love, loves, LOVES this place above all other ice cream places.  I have to say, the ice cream was good, but I didn't particularily like the amount of sea salt and fudge and blood orange olive oil that my Dainty Gentleman came with.  It ended up drowning out the flavor of the honey lavender ice cream for me.  That said though, I would come back, just to keep all their other ice cream flavors.

The perfect Sunday: get ice-cream from Bi-Rite and go to Dolores Park to people watch & soak up some sun. What separates Bi-Rite from most other creameries is the unique flavor choices.   Yes, the ice-cream is creamy, rich & delicious... but when I first came here, I was completely taken back by the choices.  Roasted coconut, salted caramel, coffee toffee, earl grey... the flavor selection can be tricky because the majority of it is unconventional.  Regardless of what flavor you decide, you won't be disappointed - each flavor has a dynamic complexity that will surprise & impress.

Great flavors - every single one I've tried. But I particularly like the Balsamic Strawberry and the Salted Caramel. The line sometimes looks long, but it moves faster than you'd think. And it's worth every moment of the wait. Don't waste your time trying to narrow your selection down to one flavor - you'll probably even have trouble narrowing it down to 3! Just try every flavor that sounds interesting, because you'll love them all.

YUM!!! We haven't been back b/c the long line on a cold evening took away any desire to come back... but LUCKY us... Driving by around 2pm on Tuesday afternoon... WHAT? NO LINE... Have to stop! Where? There are DO NOT BLOCK DRIVEWAY signs everywhere... How about pause and wait? We just ate a big lunch, so let the kids go get there ice cream... but could not pass on just a little sample of theirs.. Salted Caramel.... yum yum... The strawberry... Wow... It reminded me of the rich ice cream we had as kids... Don't know if it was the little dab on the spoon but it sure tasted good.

Delicious icecream and odd flavors.  No afternoon on a sunny day in Delores is complete without a few scoops.  I tried three! (dark chocolate, coffee toffee, and salted caramel). while all three were stellar, the shining star goes to the salted caramel. YUMmmmmmMms Price: (kinda high) $5.00. If you buy a pint for like $7, it is more cost effective.  If you share it with a friend, you will only have to pay like 3.50 each for half a pint. PLUS no waiting in the super long line if you're just buying pints.

SALTED CARAMEL! I'm a plain type of girl. I usually like chocolate ice cream, but at Bi-Rite, my hands down favorite is salted caramel. It's the perfect blend of yumminess. On a nice day, especially since Dolores park is right across the street, expect to wait in a long line. The line looks long and scary, but it goes by quickly. Everytime I come here, I always sample at least 2 other flavors just to see can I find a new favorite, but I haven't yet.

My last two-day trip to SF I came here twice. With all the yummy food in the Bay Area do I need to explain myself?! Don't be discouraged if the line wraps around the building, for a small place the line actually moves at a decent speed. I think I've tried almost every flavor here but my favorites are: Toffee Coffee Roasted Banana Brown Sugar Ricanelas Brown Butter Pecan Toasted Coconut Olive Oil For $3.25 a "scoop" you can actually try at least two different flavors if you wanted. I've also tried the Sam's Sundae and that's freakin' fantastic also! Note to self: They have restrooms available...don't need to go to the cafe across the street and buy something sucky there just to use their restrooms. -_- As seen on TV: The Best Thing I Ever Ate - Food Network Episode: Sugar Rush

Been here twice.  Had a good experience twice.  I first came with some friends after dinner and the line was seriously around the corner!  To top that, it was freezing cold!!  What were we thinking to have ice cream on a winter night??  It was worth it, though. I took my friend's advise and ordered the Honey Lavender.  I'd say it's more of a girly choice.  Every time I think of lavender, I think of how my mom would light up her lavender scent candles for bed.  I had some samples, which was so nice of the staff to let me do that, and decided on that flavor.   I usually get some sort of coffee/mocha flavors, but I wanted to try a flavor I couldn't get elsewhere.  It was good, but I wouldn't say it's the best. The second time I came was also after another dinner date, but this time, I was a bit more greedy - I got two flavors.  I decided to try the Salted Caramel along with the Lavender.  Salted Caramel is THE flavor to get at Bi-Rite. It literally tasted like salted caramel, but the flavors balanced out when eating along with the honey lavender.  This is the perfect combo for me!

On a hot, sunny day, I decided to follow the masses, and try out this place. I love ice cream, and others seem to love bi-rite so... why not. The line was long, but hey...it's always that way. The soft-serve line was very short but it's soft serve. The menu of selections was quite large and they give you a menu to peruse while standing somewhere near the corner of the block. I got the salted caramel and the toasted almond. I will say...I liked it.  I didn't love it as I had hoped to. It was okay. I also wish they knew more about which were not gluten-free as the girl that helped me didn't know so i went with the safe bets. All-in-all...if there is not a line here in the future...sure. I'll come back. However, it wasn't worth the wait on an average day.

Move over Mitchell's ice cream, Bi-Rite has become my new favorite place to get ice cream. We were here on a Thursday night and believe it or not, there was a line right up to the corner of the block.  But don't let that intimidate you because the line does move fairly fast.  Bi-Rite is very unique because they have different flavors you wouldn't find anywhere else.  The staff here are quite nice. Defintely will be back!

My first taste of the Bi-Rite Creamery consisted of a scoop of honey lavender, ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles), brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl, and creme fraiche.  These 4 scoops cost $6.25, which was served in a paper bowl. Although there was nothing fancy about these unusual flavors, they were quite distinct and original.  It wasn't like eating a Ben & Jerry's ice cream, where a bunch of incompatible things were combined; nor was it like any generic grocery store brand ice cream, where the taste tends to be more sugary than flavorful.  Bi-Rite had flavor.  Of the 4 flavors that I tried, I think ricanelas was the best.  On the other hand, honey lavender tasted more exotic. Although their ice cream selection tastes good, the serving size and price were more or less fair.  For this reason, I docked 1 star.

I really should be ashamed of the number of times I visited Bi-Rite in three days I was in the Bay over break.  But, as with most matters concerning ice cream, I am shameless. As much as I enjoyed the malted vanilla and brown sugar variations, I think my all-time favorite has to be the float with black cherry soda and ginger ice cream.  It's out of this world and worth every minute in line and penny in change.   Simply phenomenal.

Craving Bi-Rite brings out the wild child in me cuz I'm lactose intolerant.  If you see me in line here, you better believe I also parked illegally and headed to a tattoo parlor afterwards. What am I supposed to say that everyone and their mamajamas haven't already.  It's hellabellasmellaforillathrillafrommanila good.  I word searched that one and I think I'm safe that it hasn't been duplicated. I took an out of town friend here, and although he only orders "chocolate" at every ice cream joint we go to, I'm going to say that he agreed that Bi-Rite was truly, a San Francisco experience.   For $6.50, I always go for the "create your own sundae" which includes 2 scoops of ice cream, 1 topping, 1 sauce, and whipped cream.  I always choose some kind of whacky nut for my topping and burnt caramel for my sauce.  For flavors, you can't go wrong w/either Salted Caramel, Balsamic Strawberry, Roasted Banana, or Olive Oil.   For tattoos - Sailor, Tribal, Chinese/Japanese characters, and Smile Now Cry Later are not good choices.  Especially in 1 big tattoo.

Holy sh!t the line is long! But so damn worth the wait. It's usually wrapped around the corner so if you're standing right there, the wait is about 20 minutes. Salted caramel is wonderful if you love caramel. I LIKE it not love it so I enjoyed this one the least. Roasted banana was my 2nd favorite. Toffee coffee is the winner!! Try eating the toffee coffee and roasted banana together, holy sh!t!! I had no idea ice cream could taste this damn good. Poor me.

Where else is spending $84 on ice cream (in one visit ) justified? The ice cream is simply delicious, but my one true love is the chocolate chip / vanilla ice cream sandwich. Not only is the vanilla ice cream buttery perfection, but the cookies are fresh, crispy and filled with chocolatey goodness. I can eat 3 in one sitting, followed by a soft serve cone of balsamic strawberry. While I'm not crazy about every flavor (Salted Caramel and Honey Lavender to name a few), there's definitely more than enough appetizing favors to choose from. Usually I just stockpile the pints and sandwiches from the soft serve window to avoid the line.

So the first few times I came here I was pretty impressed and everything I had hit the spot, but today when I came in I was looking for something refreshing to help cool me down for the weather. I had their salted caramel and toasted coconut. Both for some reason tasted super sweet to me. I wanted something fruity, but unfortunately they didn't have anything on the menu :( I came just in time though there was no line, but as we were eating the line slowly accumulated down the street. There is also a park across the street that you can go enjoy your sweet treat at. Parking is also a pain in the butt here.

Absolutely amazing. Bi-Rite definitely lived up to its hype and I am so glad I finally was able to make it here. One of the yummiest places on earth! My friends and I were spending the day in San Francisco, and of course we had to take advantage of the gorgeous weather and grab a scoop of ice cream. We had lunch at Pizzeria Delphina earlier, and walked two blocks in order to get here. Luckily, my friends and I were able to get our ice cream just before the line got long, so we were able to get in and out within 10 minutes or so. I could not decide which flavor I wanted to get: honey lavender, chocolate almond swirl, the flavors all seemed so delicious, so much to the point that I was salivating (which may sound a little odd). I ended up choosing a single scoop of chocolate almond swirl and salted caramel (side note: for single scoops you can combine two flavors if you would like and for double scoops you can combine up to three). The two flavors complemented each other extremely well; the salted caramel was definitely something new for my taste palette, and I really liked it. The ice cream was absolutely amazing; every single bite had the perfect balance of salt and sweet, nothing was too overbearing, etc. It was so good that no words could describe it except that you have to go there! There is not that much seating around the shop, so my friends and I decided to walk around Dolores Park before heading back to Union Square. This ice cream shop is, like I said for the hundredth time, absolutely delicious. I would definitely come here every week if I lived closer; this place should definitely be on your food bucket list!

I got the seasonal pumpkin ice cream last night and it is DELICIOUS!  I'm a fan of malted vanilla and balsamic strawberry.  where do they come up with these ideas???  I come here probably once every few months and they seriously have the best ice cream I've ever had.  you can tell this is true for a large portion of the SF population as the lines are ridiculously long.  BUT, it's worth the wait.   They also have a second line for soft serve if you prefer soft serve over ice cream.  sometimes i don't want to wait in the lines for individual scoops so ill walk in and buy a pint to bring home on those days i prefer to just be in pjs and veg in front of the TV!   If you want to avoid the lines it's better to hit up a week night and EARLY... like before dinner...haha

Had the Salted Caramel and Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl. You know the food is awesome when it reminds you of other things you've eaten before!!! The nutty, dark caramel flavor reminded me of carmel popcorn when I was a kid. Hands down best ice cream I ever had. The Brown Sugar and Ginger Caramel was awesome too. Could definitely taste the strands of ginger caramel and it tastes exactly as you think it would. Do yourself a favor and stop by Bi-Rite Creamery when you're in SF!

Why did I not write a review? OH GOD WHY DID YOU CREATE CALORIES AND FAT AND WHY AM I SO VAIN. Normally I can't finish a single serving because ice creams tend to be too sweet and rich. I don't seem to have that problem here. Huh. This place was the place that got me into earl gray ice cream. I swung by it today by chance because I was in the Castro, and to my joy, they had it! AWESOME! Best earl gray ice cream EVER. I also tried their salted caramel (yums, tasted a little like slightly burnt caramel and that was cool), the snicker doodle thingey ( don't remember the name, but it was super sweet) and I love their sundae with the caramelized banana and the berry compote. Every time I come here, there is a line. Today was an especially unseasonably warm day, so I'm not sure if I was supposed to be surprised. Come on, I was able to walk around at night without a jacket... that is almost unheard of. Servers are super cool and friendly.

So I was here last week during my San Fran vacation. Back when I was still in L.A. I looked up top rated places and with OVER 4,000 REVIEWS... I had to check this place out. Never seen anything with over 2500 reviews. So it's called "Bi-Rite", a play on the word bi, as in bi-sexual I guess since its in the Castro/gay district of San Francisco. The line outside when we got there at 6pm was surprisingly long... (about a 10min wait) ...which wasn't too bad. --------------------------------------------- I got "the triple", which was my choice of 3 large scoops of ice cream or 4 normal sized scoops. I went the variety route and choose 4 scoops. I tried the SALTED CARAMEL flavor first which was the most popular flavor here on Yelp. I was originally hesitant (salted ice cream) but IT BLEW MY MIND!!! It was so frickin' good. I asked the scooper what the most popular flavors were cause 2 of the ones I wanted were out of season/stock. She recommended "Earl Grey", which was nasty (think Earl Grey tea). I also tried Almond Fudge Swirl, which was okay and Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and it was "meh." ----------------------------------------------- All-in-all the SALTED CARAMEL was absolutely amazing... the other flavors, not so much. Would love to try 2-3 flavors that I thought sounded good but were out of season. It's decent not worth the 4500+ reviews.....

After ages hearing about Bi-Rite Creamery, I couldn't stand it anymore, I need to try Bi-Rite! I need to find out what's the hype all about.  The line was there but it moved fairly quickly especially when you can't really figure out what flavors you wanted. No one seems to like to get the soft serve ice creams from BiRite, so that's just an instant warning right there. Bi-Rite has some interesting arrange of flavors Olive Oil, Balsamic Strawberry and Peach Ginger. With the clerk giving us a few metal spoons to sample the ice cream. I went with a brown sugar and salted caramel single serving ice cream. Maybe I had a weird sweet tooth, but I definitely like the Peach Ginger flavor. The Peach Ginger has a little bite to it that seems so fitting for the ice cream. Though, I'm not a big ice cream fan, I definitely can see the appeal for Bi-Rite. I will definitely need to try all those other raved about ice creams in the city also to get a better idea on why SF is coming such an Ice Cream friendly city. ----- + Pro: Overhyped? Maybe, but soo damn good! - Con (1/2): Lines can get long. - Con (2/2): My friends said, "Good luck finding parking!" I was definitely lucky :P (-b ^_^)-b Overall: Delicious ice cream that might even pleases some non-ice cream fans.

How to achieve Nirvana in SF: 1) Wait in line for a silly amount of time on a sunny Sunday in September 2) Order the Trifecta (malted vanilla, brown sugar, salted caramel) 3) Walk over to Dolores Park and people watch hippies as they play with their dogs, hula hoops, and sell "special" brownies (Apparently sunny days are reason enough to throw park parties.  This SoCal girl is amused.)   4) Repeat.

On a Saturday night at  9:30pm, this line was longer than the club! After a delicious dinner at  ChouChou, we skipped out on dessert to visit Bi-Rite. This was bookmarked on my list forever so I was excited. So there are two lines when you get there. One is for the soft ice cream which is simialr to yogurt, no thanks. That line is too short to be true so scoot over!  The other line is the line you want to get in. Its intimidating but it moves fast. There is also a menu that circulates down the line which is awesome. I decided to get the berry sundae with a scoop of  salted caramel ice cream! I love anything ginger flavored and I heard salty caramel was a must get here and what Bi -Rite is known for. Instead of two scoops of ginger I had one scoop of salted caramel and it was the perfect combination. The flavor of the ginger is a bit mild and the salty caramel balances well with my choices because it was pure delicious. It can get a bit salty after too many bites but its still so good. Oh yea, and its called the berry sundae because there are blackberries smothered on top. Yum! Overall, I love this place and cant wait to try the other flavors!

I try to stop by every time I dine in the Mission.  I've tried Humphrey Slocombe, but I think Bi-Rite is the best.  Bi-rite serves the most delicious and creamiest ice cream I've ever tasted.

This isn't ice cream. It's cold and creamy like ice cream usually is, but the folks at Bi-Rite Creamery must be sacrificing small animals by the dozen in order to tease out the magical melange of flavors offered here. I went with the Dainty Gentleman sundae. Two scoops of Lavender ice cream drizzled with Blood Orange Olive Oil, Hot Fudge, and finished with a pinch of Sea Salt. This combination lead to an incredibly complex and intriguing experience that left me speechless. After waiting 45 minutes in line, I was EXTREMELY skeptical as to the caliber of ice cream and would have knocked off a couple of stars had I received anything short of exemplary. For once, my skepticism proved to be ill-found.

This is the most reviewed business on Yelp! And for good reason-- The ice cream creations are delicious, and the flavor selections (both ice cream & toppings) are marvelous. I obviously couldn't pick just one, so we "Made Our Own Sundae" ($6.50) with: --1 scoop of Coffee Toffee (Wow.) --1 scoop of Ricaneles (cinnamon ice cream with chunks of snickerdoodle cookies. Wow.) --Brownie Pieces, Whipped Cream & Caramel (Wow.) Wowowow. Locals tell me there is a never a time there isn't a line out the door and around the corner, but if you have some time to spare, IT'S WORTH IT. ...And if you have some calories to spare, I suggest first going to their Soft-Serve Window (the line for soft-serve is much shorter), and picking up a Salted Caramel Cone to enjoy while you wait on line for the Creamery! ...Not that I did that or anything...

When I lived in Berkeley, my roommate and I would make trips to SF just to get some of this ice cream. Yes, it's that good. Ricanelas is my favorite. Smooth ice cream with snickerdoodle cookie bits mixed in? Heck yes. I like that you can get two different flavors with the small size. Plus, their staff are always so friendly and accommodating, who wouldn't want to come back? If you haven't tried Bi-Rite ice cream yet, your taste buds are missing out.

I am stuck between whether I like Bi-Rite better or Mitchell's. They both of pretty unconventional flavors added onto the regular ones. I tried a few of them but I felt bad making the others in line wait for me to try soooo I went ahead with Earl Grey and Mint Chip! I usually never get a cone but I guess I was just in the mood for it! Anywho, the staff/employees are reaallly nice and they let you try all the flavors you want. If you have a subconscious, then you'll just try a few. Haha. It's a tight place with not much room but you will definitely not miss it because they have a line that goes down and around the block!

After stopping for lunch at Ike's Place and coffee at Philz Coffee, my friends and I were super stuffed. But! I still wanted to check out Bi-Rite - famous for their gourmet ice cream flavors and featured on Best Thing I Ever Ate. (They say girls have a second stomach for dessert and I am one of those girls!) HONEY LAVENDER: I sampled the Honey Lavender and found it too floral for me. SALTED CARAMEL: Instead, I opted for a scoop of Salted Caramel. I had heard that it was one of their most popular flavors. It was really rich and creamy, but I actually did not like the burnt caramel flavor. Although I didn't particularly like the flavors I tried this time, I'd still go back to sample some of their other flavors. Hopefully, next time I won't be so stuffed so I can try more flavors!

I moved here in October of last year, and for months, whenever good dessert places come up in conversation, so does BiRite Creamery. Whenever I'd be in Dolores Park, I'd see a line outside of the store. And now, finally, I know why. The ice cream is crazy good, that's why. But not just that, the staff is nice. Like, they're really excited about ice cream. Super nice folk. When my friends and I got to the front of the line (which didn't take too long, all things considered), we asked to try a few flavors. I tried the banana--yum!--and the honey lavender--YUM. I went with a small portion of honey lavender, and I may never be able to eat another flavor of ice cream ever again. There is limited indoor seating and a few benches outside, and, well, Dolores Park to sit in right across the street. This is a great spot for a refreshing, sweet treat!

The price is rite! I have had loads of great ice-cream, primarily in Europe and Bi-Rite lives up to the hype because the flavours are rich without being sugary and it's cheap cheap cheap! 3.50 for two flavours = huzzah! I had the roasted banana and salted caramel. Bliss.

Bi-Rite has always been on my radar but recently a friend insisted that try it on a recent trip to the Bay Area so I did. Boy oh boy am I glad! I don't think there's anything I can add to the existing 4201 reviews (I'm 4202, yay!) on here except AMEN to all the other 5 star reviews. PEOPLE, IT'S TRUE! READ NO FURTHER.

Ohh yes, ohh yes, ohh yes I DIH-id, friends ^_^... I went on a Mission [District] to find treacherous street parking. I happily & patiently endured the Disneyland/X2/XS line that zipped a bit more quickly than expected. I sampled like trying on a bunch of cute clothes to find the "right one"--besides the incessantly talked-about Salted Caramel =P. I paid my $3.25--err, $7.50--for 2 orders (1 for Lei B :D) of these duo diet evildoers, http://www.yelp.com/biz_…. And after all this & with good Yelp buddies (Roll Call: Lei, Janice S, Daniel L, Hube N, Jonathan W, Tammy C, Jason G, Wanugee N), aaaahh :]...I sure was in that hard-to-barge Foodie Garden of Eden.  Easy to scoop (based on what the composed, laidback staff had to exercise their biceps for); easy to spoon--LITERALLY o_O--& easy to entice the sweet tooth... 4 stars for: Coffee Toffee; Balsamic Strawberry; Cookies & Cream; Roasted Banana; Salted Caramel 4.5 stars for: Ricanellas; Olive Oil (for REAL); Brown Sugar w/ Ginger Caramel Swirl 5 stars for this One: the slightly effervescent & sensuous Honey Lavender. Wahoo! Another year-long bookmark cleared!!

Such a long line just for ice cream....but I guess it was worth it. They had a lot of strange flavors like basil and olive oil, but for some reason when I got to the front I forgot to ask to try the weird flavors and got the balsamic strawberry and chocolate coconut instead. The two flavors were both pretty good except the chocolate coconut just tasted like chocolate but I guess it was cool cuz it was vegan. The guy who scooped my ice cream was also really cute and nice!!

OMG!  This place was amazing.  We sampled the salted caramel and we were simple transformed. That was the best ice cream I have ever had in my life.  It was decadent and complex and we  have already purchased the   'Sweet Cream and Sugar Cones' cookbook that they published earlier this year.  I have never seen an ice cream place that was so popular.   People were lined up around the corner waiting to buy this amazing treat.  So worth the wait.  Get your ice cream and walk over to Delores park and hike to the top and just sit and enjoy life!  What a great time.  We came here as one of the stops with Avital tours --- don't think about it - just go!

If you are NOT an ice cream lover like I am, then Bi-Rite will definitely change you.  I'm not sure what it is about this place, but for some reason, I always crave their ice cream now. My friends introduced this place to me when I was up in SF a few years ago.  They told me that I HAD to try it.  After refusing, they forced a bite onto me and I was hooked since. I recommend the salted carmel, the roasted banana, the peanut butter chocolate swirl, and the cookies and cream.   The best part is, if you don't want to wait in their long line...go to their fridge and grab a few pints to take home.  It's just as good without the long wait. So if bi-rite can make an addict out of me, it will definitely make one out of you. Be WARNED!!!  Haha.

I'm lactose intolerant and I forgot my lactase enzyme pills the day I came here. Oh well, any pain is worth it for me when it comes to ice cream, and this was no exception. I told my friend, "This place better be the sh*t and worth the 15 minute walk!", and I can safely say that it was worth it.  We waited in line for about five minutes and I opted for a small brown sugar with ginger and a scoop of toasted coconut, which was reasonably priced for under $4. I enjoyed them. A lot on the sweet side, and I could definitely taste the full-fatness of the cream, so it was purely decadent. Worth the extra 4 mile run I have to do to burn it off.

There's 4000 other reviews for Bi-Rite and I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that they're all saying the same thing: Bi-Rite is one of the best ice-cream places out there, if not the best in the City. Pure bliss. Utter delight. Buttery softness. Am I waxing enough poetry for you?? Grab a cone and walk over to the always vibrant Dolores Park and you have the ingredients to the making of that perfect stroll through the park. 5 stars - one star for each of the drool puddles that has formed since the writing of this review.

Bi-Rite is known for their salted caramel, but I found it a little too overwhelming after a couple bites. I tend to enjoy the more subtle flavors in earl gray, strawberry balsamic, and honey lavender. My friends have also enjoyed the roasted banana so I'll have to get that next time. Compared to the other ice creameries, Bi-Rite is creamier but it also melted faster. Tip: Parking can be hard to find and depending on the time, there will be long lines. Wear a jacket in SF!

If I waited a couple more days to write this review, I could be reviewer number 4,000 to write a Yelp review for this place! Woohoo! Why are there 4,000 reviews of this place, instead of for the local Rite-Aid with their $1 scoops of ice cream or your local strip mall's Baskin and Robbins? Here are your top 10 answers: 10. It's right across the street from Dolores Park, where post-Mary Jane indulgers are getting a munchies jones, and this will do. 9. It's right across the street from the Muni train stop, where the riders from DTSF FiDi, frustrated by cubiclization syndrome, need a sugar rush to feel good about themselves. 8. It's near all the Mission District dive bars, and after doing a dive bar crawl, Yelpers crawl over here to settle their boiling stomachs and try to stop the sky from spinning. 7. El Farolito is too heavy a meal right now, and is reserved for 2 am after bar/club meals only. 6. Newbie San Francisco Yelpers think that if they eat and review: A) Burma Superstar B) Ike's Sandwiches C) Any restaurant serving Fois Gras D) Bi-Rite Creamery then they will become Elite within two weeks! 5. Because You Scream, I Scream, We all Scream for Ice Cream! 4. Because a higher percentage of SF Yelpers were weened on breast milk than anywhere in the US, and this is the next best thing to sucking a teat 3. Because 50% of active Yelpers are Asian Women, and we all know that they all want to act, think, dress, eat, and review alike 2 Because single, on-line daters can rave about this place to their date, then agree to meet them here for their first Real World meeting, then scan them in-line and flake out if they don't like what they see 1. Because SF Yelpers are foodie snobs, and spoiled adult children who were over-indulged with ice cream and other sugary snacks, so what better way to combine Ice Cream and Gourmet Food flavors, than at Bi-Rite, where you can get them combined in one?

Bi-Rite still has some of the best ice cream you can find in SF and the entire Bay Area.  Just yesterday went for a holiday outing here and had to give their seasonal candy cane ice cream a try as it was a first for me.  Definitely a novel idea and it has a lot of potential but just not something that you want to eat a lot of past the first few spoon fulls.  It would have been fun if they had some candy cane bits in there.   What blew me away was their toasted coconut flavor.  I'm a huge coconut ice cream fan and it's hard for me to not be pleased with any kind of coconut ice cream, but toasted coconut opened up an entire new world to coconut enthusiasts.  Even my girlfriend who HATES coconut has to succumb to the awesomeness.    The toasted coconut flakes really did make this an exceptional Bi-Rite staple ice cream along with the salted caramel which everyone knows how amazing that is already. On a recent outing, a buddy of mine wanted to bring some pints to a potluck so without knowing how much the pints cost, he said to the cashier "just give me 7 pints."  The cashier girl said "what flavors?"  He responded, "whatever's good."  We got a nice 7 pack variety of Bi-Rite and it was a classic moment for everyone, especially my friend who realized how expensive the total came out to after all was said and done.  At least he came to the potluck looking like a Bi-Rite baller.

I just had a mouthgasm ! Salted Caramel gets my vote to be included in the food group pyramid !  Anyway thank you fellow yelpers ( almost 5 thousand of you ) for recommending this nirvana of an ice cream shop ! So in my reviewing system it's actually a 4 1/2 star place - not enough seating room + the server with the hoodie 1/2 unzipped and a jungle of chest hair lurking makes this place 1/2 star less than perfect , however it makes for a great date place - take her for a stroll if no seating .

Sweet Ice Cream with unique flavors. I'm not a fan of caramel but I accidentally ordered the Salted Caramel (don't ask) and I must admit, it was delicious.  The flavor was unlike any ice cream I've ever tasted before. I'm a simple ice cream guy, usually going for rocky road, chocolate, and oreo cookie.  However, because I waited in that line for half an hour, I felt spontaneous and thought I'd try something out of the ordinary for me. I left delighted.

***Bi-Rite Creamery is a very popular (as well as nationally known) gourmet ice cream shop; while all of my visits have not been superb, their ice cream is good and this is definitely a must-stop if you are an ice cream fan and find yourself in San Francisco*** I remember first finding out about Bi-Rite Creamery through Yelp.  I later saw it mentioned in a national magazine.  Of the places in Los Angeles that get national recognition (Pizzeria Mozza, Father's Office, The Bazaar), I would say that they are all worth trying.  I feel the same about Bi-Rite Creamery. The ice cream is good at Bi-Rite.  Their ice cream has a pleasing texture and some of the flavors are tasty.  My experiences here have been inconsistent though, but I think this is a given with the temperamental nature of ice cream and the flavors/ingredients used.  None of the experiences have really been bad, but the textures and flavors have been more pleasing on some visits than others. The salted caramel was not that good on this visit.  I am not sure if this was the case on previous visits, but the salted caramel had the flavor of burnt caramel.  Yelper Clara K. had mentioned this to me and it was very noticeable on this visit.  The texture was pretty good, but it was a little broken and not as smooth, creamy and dense as my last visit.  If you look at my previous photo of this flavor, you will notice a very clear difference in the texture. Their cinnamon ice cream had a much nicer flavor.  The cinnamon flavor was good and the ice cream had pieces of snickerdoodle cookies in it.  While the snickerdoodles were definitely noticeable in the ice cream and provided a considerable crunch, the addition of them was not too obtrusive. Service was quick.  If you go during the day on a weekday, you can really avoid the lines and feel more comfortable about sampling a lot of their flavors. The prices were good.  Though the scoops were small, I thought the ice cream was reasonably priced for gourmet ice cream (gourmet ice cream shops in LA, including ones not as good as Bi-Rite, seem to be more expensive). I like the ice cream at Bi-Rite Creamery and have stopped there on my last three trips to San Francisco.  While I like the ice cream, I would say I prefer Pasadena's Carmela.  Their ice cream is creamier and denser.  The flavors are also more distinct and satisfying.  In addition, while the service at Bi-Rite Creamery is fine, the service at Carmela is much more personable.  Still, I would say Bi-Rite Creamery is a must-stop if you are in San Francisco.  Their ice cream can be very good and it could likely become one of your favorites. Parking is difficult here, but I was able to find a space east of Bi-Rite Creamery and nearby Tartine.

I usually come here around the night time after dinner for a little desert, so I'm used to the norm of seeing a great deal of people waiting in line for Ice cream, which is the only terrible part about this place, but despite all that, it's a must see! I always come in for the Salted Caramel and Roasted Banana, and they are simply amazing together. I usually try out different flavors for a third scoop, because let's face it, I'm fat on the inside and I need my fill of food. For everyone who is looking for a sweet spot for some unique ice cream flavors, I'd definitely recommend it!

What's new to say about a business that holds one of the, if not THE, largest number of reviews on Yelp? - The last time I got ice cream I regretted getting two scoops because it was too much. So this time I got the kids-size scoop of salted caramel and regretted it about halfway through because it was just not enough. It was too awesome. - Salted caramel is closer to "Caramel with a burnt kick that tastes a lot like a Werther's Original". - Did I mention how good that salted caramel was? Because it was so, so very ditch-your-commitments-to-grab-some good. Yes. Yes, please. YES PLZ even. Stop by.

I came here two days in a row. What more do I have to say?!?!?!?! Just joking. My friend Abe told me to check out Bi-Rite about a month ago when I bragged about tasting one of the best ice cream in the whole wide world at a place in LA. Being the huge yelper that I am, I looked up Bi-Rite and decided it was worthy of begging my bestie to take me there. We went there on a Saturday afternoon and there was a small line as we drove past it. Don't let this sight get the best of you. It moves at a decent pace so take a breather and enjoy the crisp San Francisco air as you wait in line. On the first day, I ordered a scoop of the salted caramel and brown butter pecan. I didn't enjoyed the salted caramel too much. The flavors weren't really there for me. It reminded me of toffee instead. The brown butter pecan was AMAZING. I wished the bottom scoop was the brown butter pecan so I could have the best flavor last. Whomp whomp whomp. Total sad face. The next day I made my bestie take me to Defina for dinner because I knew Bi-Rite was across the street. After having a delicious dinner, I dragged his sorry butt to get some sweets with me. I ordered the honey lavender and malt vanilla. Both flavors were soooooooo delicious!!! I had to eat them simultaneously to keep my taste buds happy. Bi-Rite, you make me so happy, yet I am so glad I live in SoCal and Hawaii because I can't get you all the time and thus, won't be a walking fatso. (Yes, this is how I think so I don't have to feel bad about not getting to eat some of the best things the BEST COAST (aka the West Coast) has to offer me.)

Hi. My name is Lauren S. and I am just your typical unemployed 20 something. Boy if there are two things in this city I like, it's gotta be Bi-rite ice cream and Ike's sandwiches. Let me tell you why. 1. I love ice cream. Seriously, I've probably gained 10 lbs this week alone just by eating/sobbing into a lot of ice cream (hey don't ask why, mind your own DAMN BUSINESS). It's not pretty, but it's okay because I still am. Also MK told me it's probably just water weight because I'm about to hit that time of the month when I find out that I'm not pregnant and likely to stay that way. But I digress. My point is if there's one thing I have come to really know well in my 20 something years on earth, it's ice cream, and Bi-Rite is tits as we all know. 2. I love sandwiches. The more shit and mayonnaise you can pile on the better, which nobody does better than Ike's. I haven't been here since I turned my back on vegetarianism (which Jillian and Sean M. should probably do, too, because come on guys, you think a cow wouldn't put your ass on a bun if it could get its grubby hooves on you? Yeah, cows do not give a fuck so just return the favor). I'm sure they have good non-vegetarian options as well, which I may try just as soon as I can find an hour of my life to squander while waiting for a goddamn sandwich. Hey since I just mentioned two places in one review I think yelp HQ will be cool with me posting this on two different pages, right? Love ya HQ, never change. Just kilt two birds with one stone, BAM.

There trifecta (a scoop of each: salted caramel, brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl, and malted vanilla with peanut brittle and chocolate) is my absolute favorite! I have to admit though, the peanut brittle gets a bit hard on the teeth, but all the flavors are so amazing together. The waffle is good too, but I'm normally love waffle cones, so I may be bias.

Walking the neighboring streets while savoring my ice cream with my local pal Rosie, I had a momentary flash of brilliance in the form of a fierce desire to become an ice cream maker...because... "ice cream makes people happy" i cried to my friend "and I want to make people happy"... This is some of the most amazing ice cream that I have had outside of Italy. Can you say "honey lavender"? Or "roasted banana"? OR even "salted caramel"?  I tasted the flavors and since I didn't know when I'd be back to San Fran....I went for it and got all 3 scoops! This is seriously the most creamy ice cream that I have ever had and the flavors are both familiar and unusual. The salted caramel is not like any of the "pseudo caramel" flavors of the moment. It was rich and salty and luscious with that sort of smokey bite to it that carmelization brings. The roasted banana and salted carmel together was like the perfect bananas foster. The honey lavender was the most unusual. It starts out tasting a bit floral on the tongue but then changes into something sumptuous and undescribable. Best get yourself to Bi-Rite and try it yourself!

The group, including Daniel L, Jon W. Fia R, and a few others, decided it was an ice cream day, and the weather suggested it was one as well, so, after checking out the Japantown street fair, we headed to Bi-Rite.  We were greeted with a long line that wrapped around the corner of the block, so that was a pretty good sign that this place is pretty good.  I've actually been here before at night, when the line wasn't so long, so I had a taste of Bi-rite, and wasn't disappointed. This time around, I'm still a satisfied customer.  I got two scoops of the Coffee-toffee flavored ice cream, which was absolutely delicious.  I was never crazy about toffee, and the only reason I chose that flavor was because I was craving coffee at the time.  I never knew toffee could ever taste so good.  Each piece from each bite I took was heavenly.  The consistency of the ice cream was just right, not icey, not too creamy, good coffee flavor, and the toffee pieces were chewy, sweet, plentiful, and were like pieces of caramel. Another thing I like about this creamery is, their variety of flavors.  That day, they offered olive oil, basil, and other unique flavored ice cream you wouldn't expect from your typical ice cream parlor, but this isn't your typical ice cream parlor.  The place is located right next to Mission Dolores park, so if you're in the mood for a nice walk or you simply want to lay down and enjoy the weather, the park is right across the street. Well worth the wait.  I'll be back

Since I basically live for ice cream it was a no-brainer that I was coming here. I wanted to come so bad that we actually took a cab out of our way to get some ice cream. I would do it again. I tried a handful of flavors and they were all pretty delicious. I bought a double scoop of salted caramel and ricanelas (cinnamon and snickerdoodle). Salted caramel is one of my favorite flavors out there and this one was very good. It did taste a little burnt like other reviews have mentioned but I kind of liked it like that. It's not overly sweet. I do prefer the salted caramel from some places closer to me but this one did not disappoint. However, I loved the ricanelas more. It was such a yummy combo of cinnamon and doodle that I couldn't get enough. Yum, happy Tai belly. Both SN (dining partner deluxe) and I noted that there was a bit of a funky aftertaste. It sort of lingered in the top of your mouth. Hmm. odd. Regardless I would still definitely come back for some more of their delicious and unique ice cream offerings!

Bi-Rite serves delicious ice cream, and fortunately I love ice cream too much. If you come during a down-time, they're generous with their samples.  I can understand why people will feel rushed during a busier hour, though. Both times, I've had Salted Caramel and Ricanelas.  Nothing against the other flavors, I just enjoy these two a lot.  Ricanelas in particular, because they remind of CHURROS.  Cinnamon and sugar is a delicious combination.  However, whatever kind you choose will sure to be bursting with flavor.   A double scoop runs around $5 dollars, and you can choose up to three flavors. The place is situated near a park and a high school, and there tends to be parking just a block down. Bi-Rite is delicious!  There's a lot of delicious ice cream/dessert places to get in SF, however, so take your pick!

I tried their balsamic strawberry, malted vanilla, cinnamon with snickerdoodle, and the heavily popular salted caramel. The balsamic strawberry was very good, very unique. The same goes for malted vanilla and cinnamon snickerdoodle. I would say my favorite flavor was the cinnamon snickerdoodle. The salted caramel was good but not my favorite. Was on par with the salted caramel from an ice cream store down in Brentwood. The salted caramel's flavor was strong, but almost too strong for the tongue. Overall very good place to get ice cream and i would not mind coming back here for more if in town...

Simply phenomenal ice cream. Fresh and flavorful, the ice cream really excels in its texture, it's just never wrong. I've been through my flavor phases, first salted caramel, then the balsamic strawberry, then roasted banana and toasted coconut, and now on to the brown sugar with ginger swirl. Pro-tip: If you've never been, sure, wait in the line, but if you know what you're doing, go inside, grab a pint, and skip the line. Their popsicles are also great, although I've never seen the pineapple mint that haunts me.

Taking my brother to Bi-Rite was the equivalent of my 3rd grader class nerd self taking my parents to Open House at school -- there is nothing better on earth than showing my shit off! I've been to Bi-Rite a number of times -- I credit my beautiful fellow foodie partner in crime Angie B. for this fateful introduction -- and I have been blown away each and every time. The first time I tried (and subsequently purchased a pint to-go of) salted caramel, my life was altered forever.  Not only is it neatly salty, but the ice cream flavor tastes JUST LIKE you bit off a fresh piece of old-fashioned caramel.  So real, so good. Bro opted for chocolate coconut and roasted banana (which also made my eyes roll into the back of my head -- it tasted EXACTLY like a fresh banana thrown into a roaster would taste like), and I of course fell for the coffee toffee and had to have my other standby, balsamic strawberry.  I think I prefer the balsamic strawberry up at Molly Moon's in Seattle, to be honest, but Bi-Rite does it quite well also. The workers were nice but efficient, so standing in the shortest of lines was like nothing.  Generous scoops, enthusiastic line-goers, and plenty of cute dog-watching was a hearty bonus.  Thanks for always bringing the happy my way, Bi-Rite -- see you again soon! REVIEW NUMBER 400 GOES TO MY FAAAVORITE INSTITUTION IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA!!!  I HEART YOU BI-RITE :)

SALTED CARAMEL!  It would be better to have a spoon that scoops and not a useless wooden tongue presser that the doc uses!  Kinda expensive but worth it.

Yeah, right.... The ice cream here is good but is a bit cursed by Yelpers hype, line went around the corner... I've tried a double scoop of Chocolate with Balsamic Strawberry. Pretty good, balsamic subtle but interesting. Wifey had the Honey Lavender with Salted Caramel; not to shabby... Parking around the Mission is tough, but particularly tough around this area; maybe I should have considered taking the Muni or BART... Tastes ok but I like Carmela in Altadena better (they have a Blackberry Malbec sorbet right now to die for...)

(See pics) Yes worth the line waiting but the wait was actually not slow at all. With all the different cuisines I have had, I always like trying new tastes and that includes ice cream flavors. The olive oil was very subtle (but not oily at all) and was cute tasting with the smoothness to it. The basil was quite refreshing and different as usually I think of both as cooking ingredients. Good job for the inventive tastes and introduced me to savory ice-cream!!

I remember it being a gloomy day.  Wandering around SF has its perks. One of them is walking up the wrong street and finding the right place. What can you say about how awesome Bi-Rite is that hasn't been said? Can I give it a 1-star just to get some attention? Maybe. But as a business owner myself, I know that's just plain wrong. Bi-Rite in SF is good, great, and amazing all at once. The store is small, the lines can be long, but you know you made the right decision. Portion sizes aren't big, but the ice cream is rich and filling. If you're a foodie, Bi-Rite is one of those meccas for ice cream. Enjoyyyyy! :)

So...I've been here a few times. Every time I went, I've stood in line, sampled different flavors, and opted for my go-to order: a small cup of honey lavender and balsamic strawberry. (The salted caramel is just too rich in my opinion.) However, Saturday was different. 1. There was no line. Like, at all. (I KNOW! Craziness.) 2. Since there was no pressure, I took my time and sampled three flavors. I was about to order when the guy who was helping me asked the fateful question, "Do you want to try something fun?" ...Hell yeah I want to try something fun! 3. He spooned a little honey lavender ice cream (ftw!) then went to the back counter and did some magic. After 10 seconds he handed me a spoon that looked something like a Jackson Pollock piece. 4. The result was an explosion in my mouth. Literally. Never tasted anything like it. I felt like a kid in a candy shop that tried Everlasting Gobstoppers for the first time, but this was INFINITELY better because we all know those probably taste horrible while whatever was on the spoon was epic. EPIC. 5. Thus, I was introduced to The Dainty Gent. (More than just dainty if you ask me...) *ahem, clears throat* May I present to you...Bi-Rite's honey lavender ice cream drizzled in blood orange infused hot fudge, extra virgin olive oil, and sprinkled with a touch of sea salt. You may think I'm nuts. (Olive oil? Who would've thought?) But I let my friend try a bite, thence she made a fast beeline down the street and asked the guy at the counter, "Hi, my friend was just here...Can I have something fun?"

Came here on a lovely Friday evening with a friend who is a die hard fan of this place, so of course I was expecting amazing things. It was a chilly, foggy San Francisco summer evening, and yes, there was still a line! Must mean it's that good, right? I ordered a small, which is apparently two scoops and most people seem to mix it up with two flavors, but I chose to branch out and go for the Basil ice cream. Since I wasn't sure what other flavor might go with my selection, I chose to stick with having both of my scoops be the same. The texture is definitely something to write home about. It's so creamy and smooth, and probably the most memorable part about the ice cream. The basil was an interesting choice for an ice cream flavor. I had eaten tomato and basil pasta right before, so this reminded me a lot of the spaghetti sauce and was a nice compliment. Located right across from Delores Park, it made for a nice walk after ordering. Definitely a place I'll visit again.

I was in the Bay area visiting family and my cousin said that we had to try either Mitchell's OR Bi-Rite Creamery....we were closer to Bi-Rite....WAHOO - I am soo glad we came here! After a challenging time finding parking on a Saturday evening, the line was around the corner. I would guess over 100 peeps waiting for this wonderful ice cream shop. (So worth the wait!!) While in line, from my iPhone, I was able to read through less than a fraction of the 3000+ Five Yelp Star reviews. But the decision was easy - a scoop of the Salted Caramel Ice Cream was a must! I went a tad further than a few of the reviews that I was able to read....I ordered the "Trifecta".... The Trifecta is one scoop each of three different flavors, the Salted Caramel, a Malted Vanilla with peanut butter brittle and small milk chocolate bites, and a Brown Sugar with a ginger caramel swirl. (See my iPhone photo) I am not good at explaining heavenly tastes, but much like wine and food are paired together....the flavors that all three were smooth, rich and a creamy goodness in each bite. You don't inhale this ice cream, you savor each spoonful and appreciate each taste for each of their complimentary flavors. The sweet and salty conundrum is apparent in every scoop....you will learn with each bite why SWEET and SALTY compliment each other...OMG...I am hungry for Bi-Rite's Creamery "Trifecta". I LUV IT....Five Yelp Stars....I am screaming for Bi-Rite Creamery!! ;-p

Ice cream shops and I are friends.  Especially gourmet, fresh made ice cream.  I become very zen when it is near.  Knowing the purity of sugar, milk, and special flavors are about to dance on my tongue and sing to my stomach and taste buds.   This place is a double bonus because I have always found parking quickly, the neighborhood is nice to stroll while devouring my special treat.  I love the market! Their flavors are inventive and traditional and delicious.  I am in love with their banana-don't be fooled by the simplicity! Worth the wait, worth a couple trips around the block if needed for a parking spot, worth the excursion on a warm evening. Love this place!!

After recently visiting my brother, he took me to this ice cream place.  I'm a huge ice cream fan and I can honestly say, hands down, the best ice cream I have ever tasted in my life!  The crew here were so nice.  They pretty much gave me samples of ever flavor in the store which made my decision so hard.  I settled on salt caramel (the best) mixed with a snicker doodle ice cream.  The prices are good, the amount you get is perfect and judging by the line that wraps around the block for this stuff, you know it's good!

This place is worth the hype!

Do not be turned away by the long line. Be like me and complain the whole time, but there is wonderful, ice creamy gold at the end of the rainbow. I've been wanting to try this place out for quite a while now, and finally got around to it a couple weeks ago with Xandra. I got the salted caramel and the Ricanelas. With the perfect balance of sweet and salty, you really can't go wrong with the salted caramel. And the Ricanelas... Think of snickerdoodles. While I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, I know that whenever I'm near Dolores Park, I will probably pay a visit.

I know there's been a rage with going to big ice cream sundae places like Fentons and Leatherby's but I think if you want some yummy ice cream and nothing too crazy bi-rite is the best!  I can honestly say it's my favorite of the places I've been to just because the flavors are rich and the ice cream is super creamy.  I love ricanelas, coffee toffee, malted vanilla, brown sugar -- and today, I tried the olive oil and though it really does taste like it, it's pretty darn good!   The only issue I really see here is the parking.  Drove around almost half an hour (and at night) and finally found some parking a few blocks down.  The line may seem long but it goes by pretty quite when you're chatting with a friend.   If you haven't tried this place yet, I highly recommend because it's worth going to!

When i first came to this place, i saw a line and thought it was long already, then i looked behind me and there was another line and a line after that. I was thinking "Screw this, let's leave", but something told me i had to try this place out. So i stood in line for over 20 minutes and finally reached inside and got to order. I ordered the famous salty caramel and the toffee coffee and my bf ordered a scoop of banana and another scoop of coconut. I didn't quite like the flavors he chose, nor the coffee flavor, but on the other hand, i LOVED the salty caramel! Best ice cream flavor and so worth the wait! I highly recommend trying this place even if the line intimidates you. It truly is quality ice cream!

You know how most ice cream places will tout a certain flavor (i.e., "key lime pie," "vanilla custard," "mixed berry") and then give you something that only tastes vaguely like the real thing, all synthetic and pumped full of Red #40 coloring? Bi-Rite is one of the very few creameries I've been to where the flavors taste exactly like what you get, and that's what makes their ice cream extraordinary. I had the salted caramel, which tastes like the caramelized crust of a creme brulee, and the brown sugar with ginger swirl, which had warm, round flavors. They charge $3.50 for a single which contains "2 little scoops" - but don't be deceived by the word "little," these are little scoops with magnificent flavor! I also love the old school wooden spoons they give you - how else can you better enjoy natural flavors with a natural, compostable spoon? :) Friendly service and phenomenal ice cream. Writing this review makes my stomach ache for more!!

My second favorite was lavender.

This probably my favorite ice cream place in San Francisco. It would be pretty hard top this place. Birite has unique flavors that you just don't find anywhere else. Salted carmel, balsamic strawberry, brown sugar with a ginger sugar swirl, roasted banana. They change their flavors from time to time which makes me want to come back even more. Their sundaes are really delicious as well, but it is huge and rich. So, I suggest sharing it with other people. Parking around here can be tricky, but if you go to the side streets in the area, you should be able to find parking. Lastly, don't be discouraged when you see the line. There will always be a line there no matter what time or what day it is. Honestly, the ice cream is totally worth the wait!

I'll get to the point since there are already 4,000+ reviews: --Very good ice cream.  Some flavors are better than others.  The lavender is excellent. --Very mediocre baked goods.  My brownie was dry and lacked any fudgey flavor.  The cookies look burnt and are way too crispy. --Sundae was skimpy on the sauces. --They compost.  Bi-Rite earns some angel points for that.

This place is completely over-hyped. It has an amazing reputation, but every time I go, I keep trying to convince myself that I will eventually grow to like its flavors. The problem for me is that their ice cream is slightly salty and icy, compared to the typical creamy ice cream you would find at other stores. A lot of people actually enjoy that, so if that's what you're looking for, go for it.

BiRite- I love you like a fat kid loves cake. and ice cream, and sundaes and cheetos and more cake! Seriously, salt should be on everything sweet because that combination is genius. Bi-Rite creamery is very well known in the City as one of the best ice cream shops and it's a legit claim. They offer a variety of unique ice cream flavors that are made with really good ingredients. Where else can you find salted caramel and ricanelas? They also make them in ice cream sandwiches or in sundaes, as well as cakes!! Just next door they have the a tiny window where you can pick up soft serve, cookies and baked good if you don't want to brave the line, usually around the corner but so worth it. You can also just skip ahead of the line and buy a pint of their ice creams to enjoy at home.  Midnight munchies worthy!

Are you kidding me Bi-Rite Creamery? Are you for real? Pretty sure they use hints of magical spice to make ice cream THIS good. I mean come on. If you disagree with me I don't think I want to know you (that might be a bit dramatic, but so what). This place had a line out the door. I waited 15 minutes to get to the front. Worth it? You bet your sweet ace it was! The people at the front were handing spoon-fulls of this and that, left and right, allowing us to try multiple flavors before ordering. I ended up trying the basil and olive oil flavors. The basil tasted like basil. Maybe somewhat like a margherita pizza. Which was fine, but not really my favorite when it comes to ice cream. However, the olive oil was phenomenal. I know it sounds super weird, but you have to trust me on this one. I ended up with a scoop of balsamic strawberry and salted caramel. I wasn't crazy about the salted caramel like everyone else is, apparently, but I was completely obsessed with the balsamic strawberry. The balsamic tangyness really brought out the sweet strawberry flavor. Salted caramel tasted like salted caramel. It was delicious, but I'm not a huge caramel fan. I ordered it mainly because everyone raves about it. I think next time I'll order the strawberry again, and this time pair it nicely with a scoop of olive oil. MmmmmMMmmmmm! P.S. You can purchase your birthday cake here, or pints of their famous flavors. You can also purchase their many delicious varieties of hot fudge in a jar. I'm crazy about this place!

4.5 stars! Venture outside-the-box or be more daring and go for the vegan chocolate coconut ice cream and/or the orange cardamom! Both flavors go well together. The orange cardamom had a wonderful exotic aroma to it.  It reminds me of an Indian dessert.  The ingredients that they use in their ice cream really shine through, such that your palate and senses can actually distinguish them.  They are also not overpowered by the rich, sweet taste of sugar and milk that typically forms the base of regular ice cream.   I was disappointed they didn't have the olive oil drizzled over sea salt dark chocolate ice cream that I had seen once featured on the FoodNetwork.  However, all their other flavors are just as unique and good. The next time I visit, I hope to also try the balsamic strawberry, if available.

Made my own sundae and it was underwhelming, almost bad. The pumpkin ice cream didn't taste like pumpkin. The caramel sauce didn't taste like caramel. The ginger cookies were very gingery though. The egg nog and brandy  ice cream was pretty good. People who sit inside Bi-Rite need to LEAVE shortly after they've finished eating. Our table folks were nice to do so! We did the same. It was weird seeing a Googler literally jump onto my seat though and put a scarf, then bag, on the surrounding seats.

While the hubby is a pho-snob, I consider my area of expertise to be desserts - in particular ice cream.  So when I heard about this place, I begged and begged and BEGGED to go.  But having two little kiddos and working (nowhere near the city) doesn't make it easy to make a trip out just to eat some ice cream.  So when we got some vacation time, I decided FOOD TOUR!  And finally made our way here!  And I must say, it was worth the wait! For starters, upon entering the shop you feel like you stepped into a mom-and-pop creamery in Lake Tahoe.  The little display at the front and the rustic mini-tables add to the charm (though I'm sure people waiting in line forever wish there was more seating).   Next, you are confronted with a dairy case with dry-erase markered flavors written on it.  And oh, the choices!  After perusing the selection and doubting, second guessing, and negotiating with my kids to get them to select flavors I wanted to try (evil, I know), we finally settled on: Salted Caramel Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle Strawberry with Balsamic White Chocolate Raspberry Swirl My favorite of the four was the Salted Caramel.  Amazing flavor, not too sweet and such creamy texture.  The malted vanilla was also awesome.  In the strawberry, the addition of the balsamic really cuts the sweetness and gives it a pleasant tang.  The white chocolate rasp was the most "ho hum" of the flavors (my kid is not very food-adventurous) but also delicious. Definitely worth the drive if you don't live in the area!

MMMMMMMM!!!!!! You know, for having SO much business (line down the block) and a pretty big menu, this place moves and operates really really well.   Salted Caramel ice cream.  Wow.  Just, wow.   Get the sundaes.  I mean, you're there to have a treat, so have one.  The first time we went, (we were on vacation and only in town for 2 days) I made my own sundae with a scoop of salted caramel, a scoop of creme fraiche, almond toffee, hot fudge, and brownie pieces.  DAMN.  Pat had the sam sundae, of course, since he's italian and loves olive oil.  It was great!  I think even less olive oil would be ok since there was a good amount left over at the end.  Very generous in general, they are.   The next time we were there, a few days later, I had the berry sundae with salted caramel instead of ginger because they were out, and you know, I think I can stop trying things.  If I ever go back, that's what I'm getting.   Most importantly, their customer service was excellent.  They were patient even looking out at a line that just won't stop.  They let us sample whatever we wanted with grace and a good attitude.  They seem happy to be there, and all in all it was a great experience.  Why bother with crappy Humphrey Slocombe when you can have Bi-Rite?  Their flavors are way more creative and are made better, and the ambiance is better.  Way to go!

This place earns its reputation as among the best ice cream in town. Scratch that, the best ice cream in the state and perhaps in the country/world. Bi-Rite blends aspects most other ice cream places wish they had: 1) The balance between classic flavors and "trendy" ones. You can come here and get a great vanilla, or instead decide on something a little more adventurous. 2) Standout flavors that are consistent winners. Ricanelas is easy to gloss over when you're evaluating the menu, but you absolutely have to try it. I don't even like snickerdoodles that much but combining them with cinnamon ice cream makes for a frozen treat that is truly delightful. 3) Proximity to a park. Underrated I think in terms of aspects that make an ice cream place likable, but being able to stroll out to the park is a huge benefit. 4) Generosity with samples. It would be easy for a place this popular with a line this long to be stingy about sampling, but Bi-Rite lets you sample around, gives you real spoons (Interested in how many of those they go through per day) and still manages to keep the line going. OK, so the line is usually ginormous, but if you are willing to eat ice cream at 10 in the morning or when it is very cold outside (and we all know who of us we are), it can be avoided. Either way, if you're stopping for ice cream in San Francisco, you must start at this place.

Loooove it!   This is ice cream Mecca!   So we tried it because of the episode "Best Thing I Ever Ate!" Dessert from foodnetwork.  OMG, there's a line!  But, I am a patient guy, so we waited....line does move pretty quick!     Our turn came finally, and they gave us these  metal spoons for every flavor we want to try.  I love their conscious effort to go GREEN!   I tried almost all the flavor and loved it all!    I bought the salted caramel, every bite is goooood! Best ice cream I have ever tried!   Better than the gelato ice cream  that tried like a crazy guy with no tomorrow in Rome!   Will come back!  If you live in the Bay area ( or visiting) and is not afraid of sugary sweetness, you should try this!

This place is by far my favorite ice cream place so far. My trip would not be complete if I hadn't stop by Bi-Rite for their ice cream. Every time I'm here though, I'm torn between what flavors to get because they're all super yummy!!! Honey Lavender is always a must for me and other flavors like Salted Caramel, Earl Grey, and Roasted Banana are tasty as well. Can't wait to come back for some more ice cream! Oh and they have stamp cards for buy 10 get 1 scoop for free. The workers there don't point these out but there should be a stamp card at the register.

I happened to be at my cousin's place and was taking the dog for walk when I stumbled upon Bi-Rite. I was way too excited! I've been meaning to try this place for a long time, but parking has always deterred me from coming into this area. The shop was pretty empty when I went and there was no line so I got pretty lucky. I was told that the line wraps around the block sometimes. Love the samples- they give you a lot on the spoon! The flavors are really unique- not just your average vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry. Brown sugar, candy cane, coconut, ginger.. most flavors reflected Christmas! Love it. Tried the salted caramel, honey lavender, and malted vanilla. I wish I got to sample more. Stuck with a a scoop of salted caramel and honey lavender (which surprisingly, does NOT taste like soap). Salted caramel is REAL good and I wish I got double scoops of it. Didn't disappoint! I'll be back to try everything else :)

It's delicious, homemade ice cream in a variety of mindblowingly creative and ridonculously scrumptious flavors. Yes, you have to wait in a long line to get a scoop, but something about waiting in line for ice cream makes you feel all giddy inside. (Note: If you want a homemade fruit popsicle, you do not have to wait in said line, and if you are okay with soft serve, the line is generally shorter. However, you're here, and unless you live in SF, you may as well go big and creamy!) With a "single" scoop you get more than enough ice cream and two flavors. I couldn't resist a cone, but if I did it again I would cup it because it was hot. My scoops were melting so quickly that I had to shove it all in my mouth before it ended up in a sad pool on the sidewalk. As a result, I wasn't able to appreciate the culinary nuances of salted caramel versus brown sugar with some nifty gingery swirl. The most my tongue was able to process was "cold, salty, sweet, gingery, good!" A little birdie told us next time we should try the honey lavender. Who knew birds had such refined taste buds?

Honestly. Bi-Rite *IS* one of the most San Franciscan things to do..... Take a hot SF summer day + Bi-Rite's 3 scoop in a cup for $5.  Can't go wrong with their Salted Caramel, Roasted Banana, and Honey Lavender. + Lounging @ Dolores Park across the street with all SF uniqueness going on. = Super chill and THE way to spend an weekend afternoon. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) If  you want to take a pint home, I like how they have a walk up window. They have all the flavors and it's $7.   (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) I like how they package the ice cream a super heavy duty paper bag so your ice cream doesn't melt on the way home. \ (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) Tourist approved

Don't know if anything too new can be written about Bi-Rite with 4,000+ reviews on Yelp, but it is simply delicious. Whenever it is a nice day out in SF and I'm in the City or if I have visitors who have some sweet tooth, I make sure to come by. The line is indeed always pretty long on the weekends whenever I'm here, but if you are here with friends and people are walking by, you have plenty of people-watching to do and topics to discuss. My go-to combination is salted caramel and roasted banana. NOM!

Despite all the hype I've heard about Bi-Rite, this place did not disappoint!! This was so nice on a warm day. I tried the balsamic strawberry and it was so yummy. I had to get the salted caramel since it's so highly recommended. Had it with the toasted coconut...it had actual pieces of coconut and the texture was perfect! Saddest part was when I looked down in my cup and there was nothing left.

One of my favorite places to get ice cream and I always have to come here every time I go to SF. This place has all sorts of weird flavors but its "signature" is the salted caramel. Correct me if I'm wrong but I think this was one of the first places that started this flavor and now you can basically get this flavor anywhere. I love how this place is also very environmentally friendly and this place serves your ice cream in com-posable utensil and cups. F.Y.I. This place can get very crowded at night pass 8pm and on weekends.

It's great! I've only been there a couple times and have had the required Salted Caramel Ice Cream.   I'd recommend it. If it's a nice sunny day, then it's a definite.  Go there, walk around the Mission, go to Dolores Park or just sit at the bench outside. If you are on vacation, it's worth the trip and you'll probably also discover something new and exciting outside of Union Square and the Golden Gate Bridge! Also, I think they have to charge extra if you say you are going to eat in.  So...don't forget to say, "to-go!"

Salted caramel... the standard that all other ice cream should be judged against. The long line is part of the experience and makes that first bite a reward for all your zen like patience. Yes, you can forgo the line and buy a carton, but the salted caramel just didn't taste as good at home... too mushy.

I was born with somewhat of an aversion to sweet flavors; consequently, I always cringe whenever I eat cake, ice cream, pies, etc. The Earl Grey flavor here, however, was just the right amount of sweet and decadence for my sweet-sensitive tongue to handle; the salted caramel did sound and taste intriguing at first, but made my eyes turn super Asian instead. Will come back to steal all available tubs of Earl Grey in the near future.

Context: we went on a Sunday during the mission street fair so I imagine it was busier than usual. We went about 4pm. Atmosphere: the line was as long as Aline at a Disney attraction wrapping down the street and around the corner, corralled by stanchions to keep you out of the way of pedestrians. We brought our kindles and read the ny times while we waited for at least an hour.  There are several options though. You can wait in a much smaller line and just get soft serve or go inside. Inside the little shop when you finally get in to order, there are some condiments like fudge and caramel for sale and pints in the fridge and a selection of ice cream cakes. They also sell cookies from the counter. Service: servers were patient and accommodating as we tried a couple of favors. Given the line, you would expect harried or rushed servers, but they seemed to take it in stride. Food: the ice cream is good and unusual but is it worth an hour and a half line? Not so much but that is up to personal opinion. But we did take the ice cream to Dolores park which is just a cross the street so that was nice. The ice cream is incredibly rich, dense and smooth with very little air. Servings are small but they are very accommodating in letting you have multiple favors per serving. We had salted caramel and it was excellent and we had some kind of malted flavor with peanut brittle. The caramel is very intense. We also had the brown sugar ginger which was our least favorite but they were all good.

Bi-Rite Creamery is amazing! Lots of different flavors of ice cream that you can play around with, or a menu full of colorful creations already created by the staff. It's not just limited to ice cream either, they also give an array of baked goods. The wait can be a bit hectic but it's worth the wait for this place.

Not a fan. Honey lavender was very mild and not in a "sophisticated, subtle" way... just in an uninteresting way. Out of Ricanelas so my wife got another flavor, ordered a "single" but received a "kid's size." Really? These are your size creations... at least stick to your own created verbiage. I guess salted caramel is supposed to be great but I'm not willing to wait in an absurdly long line again for it.

I tried cookies and cream and maple walnut- both were delicious! They are known for their salted caramel but it was liked by 4/7 people (the 4 were girls, the 3 that did not were guys). All in all, great ice cream spot but I think I prefer other ice cream spots in LA over Bi-Rite.

At the risk of being dumped by my bf or snubbed by a mob of incredulous hipsters, I have to admit that I just don't get all the fuss.  Maybe if you love salted caramel ice cream... but I don't.  And I think it's a little too sweet for me (have tried a few flavors). BiRite serves delicious ice cream, so I would go back if I were in the hood and craving some ice cream.  But I wouldn't go out of my way and wouldn't be caught dead lining up out-the-door-around-the-corner-down-Dolores for it.

Came here the same day as Pride at 9pm or so after having Mexican for dinner with a friend! Woohoo! Who knows how we managed to have such a heavy dinner, and still had room for dessert? OH DUH. Because it's ice cream we're talking about here. The streets were blocked off because of Pride, but I knew we had to make it to Bi-Rite! Was graced with parking half a block away. As we walked over, the streets reeked of alcohol, urine, and god knows what, though it did not disrupt our appetite for the creamy goodness of Bi-Rite Creamery. Not a very long line just quite yet, but it was getting there. A random passerby-er asked if we were getting salted caramel and the crowd in line said "OF COURSE!" Had the single size ($3.25) of infamous salted caramel and malted vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate.  Friend had the same! Salted caramel almost tastes like toffee to me, with a little burntish taste. It was good! And paired with the malted vanilla was nice, because I enjoyed the surprise of texture from the peanut brittle and milk chocolate. Yeah, do yourself a favor and get the salted caramel. It really is what it's hyped up to be.

So there has to be something to the 4000+ reviews for this place, right? Came here on 11/11/11 just before 11 and the line was out the door. Good sign, right? Had a menu passed down to us as we waited to enter. Arriving at the counter we were welcomed to try different flavors. I ended up getting the afternoon sundae (roasted banana ice cream with graham crackers and whipped cream), while my friends got salted caramel, coffee toffee, and white chocolate with raspberry swirl. The roasted banana ice cream was off the charts delicious. It wasn't one of those syrup-flavored, heavily sweetened deals - the flavor was fragrant and activated all my senses. The graham cracker crumbles were very light, as was the whipped cream. A+ effort. The salted caramel was awesome,  too. My favorite candy of all time is caramel, and the sweetness of it is opposed by a salty finish, leaving you with a sense that you're eating caramel popcorn without the stupid kernels getting stuck in your teeth. Coffee toffee was another thumbs up. A rich and floral coffee aroma accented by toffee chunks. The white chocolate with raspberry swirl was exactly as advertised. Nothing outrageous, but still good. Great ice cream. Horrible parking, but it's San Francisco, so what can ya do? *wanna read a side story?* As I drove around the block to find near impossible parking, I came across an Acura MDX-driving douchebag who had obviously circled the block one too many times. He decided that he was going to force his way into a space which fit a Civic. After pushing the car behind him back half a foot and the car in front a half foot, he was good to go. EPIC TRIP TO SF TONIGHT!

DESSERT: 1.) Strawberry balsamic - yummieee fit my craving that night 2.) Salted caramel - good tasty interesting. Other times I loove this, but tonight I was in a more tart fruity mood 3.) Basil - very interesting. Tastes like italian meal in spoonful. Odd. Lol. Service Pink hair girl... starts with an a, "like he street name" they say but I didn't know what that street was lol Maybe it was Arguello. Yea? Anyway usually at ice cream stores I fel bad asking for s many samples but she let me sample a lot, more than I intended to. But it made me upgrade to two flavors instead of jus one. And now I'll instead of only one flavor on my to come back for, I'm down o come back for the strwberry balsamic... or the chocolate coconut one ATMOSPHERE: Very small shop.

Bi-Rite is conveniently located at a street corner near Dolores Park. Hot days mean the line could extend past the building corner, but don't be discourage because the ice cream is that good. I'm just going to highlight some flavors that stood out. Salted Caramel - A fan favorite and is a growing taste trend across the city. Honey Lavender - Smells like lavender, which in turn reminds me of soap. However, it doesn't taste like soap, so I definitely enjoyed it. Sam's Sundae - I believe my sundae was beyond salty, so I couldn't enjoy this as I wish I could. The interior is small, but I never hang around inside. I rather eat my ice cream outside, by the park or on the go. I definitely recommend this place to others, but a word to the wise is to try new flavors before you commit to buying a scoop. There are plenty of flavors to get lost in, and it just means you will have to come back and try different flavors.

I have no idea why I hated on Bi-Rite a year ago. Bi-Rite, will you ever forgive me? I don't know what I'd do without the salted caramel! This time around, I gave the salted caramel another try, along with the olive oil. Both me and Kevin L. got the same thing. We agreed that the combination of salted caramel and olive oil really brought out the fruitiness of the salted caramel. DELISH!!! The flavors were great by themselves too. _Salted Caramel: What can I say that would add to this discussion. If you're a fan of salted caramel, you'll love this. The salt is there but not overpowering; it merely serves to highlight the sweet, roasted and buttery caramel flavor. YUM! It's a favorite for a reason! (Side note- I think I might have hated on it previously because I didn't think it was complex enough.. maybe the batch I had lacked salt? OR I was just being weird.) _Olive Oil: Very subtlely flavored, it tastes rich and olive oil-like. Again, it doesn't overwhelm. It's fruity and maybe even a little floral. I suspect it'd be great with some sea salt sprinkled on top, which would bring out the flavors more. Also, I wonder how this would've tasted with the Basil ice cream? Probably awesome!! Like pesto in ice cream form.. who could say no to that ;) Grab a cone and head over to Dolores... only danger is trying to keep the ice cream from melting all over the place. But it's definitely worth it!

I used to buy pints from the Bi-Rite store across the street to avoid the long lines here, but now I realize it is better to get individual scoops here. When I buy a pint, I end up eating the carton in like a day, but getting small scoops here is much better for portion control! All the flavors are delicious. I just had a scoop of their basil ice cream today, and it was diviiiiiiine!

Somehow Bi-Rite fell of my radar of places to review. Not that it needs anymore, it already has made quite a name for itself. What else can be said about near perfection? Not a whole lot. If I lived any closer to Bi-Rite, i'd need a lipid panel. Stat. Location is key, it's right off of Dolores Park, making it perfect to grab and go eat on the grass on a nice day. Flavors are adventurous but they don't get too out there like Humphry Slocombe (good or bad), my favorites are Honey Lavender, Ricanella's, Salted Caramel, and who would've thought, Olive Oil ice cream could taste so good? Writing about them has just made me salivate and I think I'm past due for a visit. Time to whip out the old stamp card!

After a delicious dinner at Pizzeria Delfina, my friend and I had some time to kill before heading downtown for a concert, so we wandered the Mission and not-so-coincidentally wandered over to Bi-Rite Creamery for dessert. We managed to get here right before the after-dinner rush--there were only a couple of people in line ahead of us. As the night wore on, the hungry hipsters started lining up for their ice cream fix. As so often happens to me in the gourmet ice cream shops that are popping up all over the city, I was overwhelmed with the number of choices. Tasting a couple, each and every one would have made a delicious scoop. Which one do you choose when you want them all? Our server was so patient as we made our way sampling about a half dozen flavors--yes, we were one of those customers--before making our final selections. I finally settled on a double scoop with brown sugar and salted caramel. (How can you not order the salted caramel? It's practically a national treasure!) The ice cream was so smooth and creamy. The salted caramel had that rich taste of buttery caramel, with a hint of salt to excite the palate. The brown sugar was sweet, but not overwhelmingly so, with a hint of dark molasses. Yes, it was a definite sugar rush, but just what I needed as an early evening pick-me-up.

Please forgive me for the following review. This ice cream is alright. *ducks onslaught of machine gun fire* I know that you guys LOVE this ice cream! Me? I liked it a lot. Perhaps it had been built up too much in my mind? Picture this: I'm sitting around a family table in Tiburon. I've just cooked supper of bacon wrapped tenderloin with a Malbec,honey thyme reduction. We've just opened a bottle of Alsatian ice wine for dessert when I'm asked, "So Mary, what do you have planned other than hanging out with us on this trip?" Without hesitation, I blurt out, "Bi Rite! I have to try Bi Rite ice cream!" (I have always been overly enthusiastic) I scan my mind to reread all the treasured reviews from on-point authors with impeccable taste. Who LOVE Bi Rite ice cream. I nod to myself for my good decision to make this trip, other than spending time with my family, ALL about Bi Rite. "Isn't that the hipster San Francisco Ice Cream place?" I am asked, and I acknowledge with a proud nod of being in-the-know thanks to all of you fabulous Yelp authors, my other familia.:-) I text friends to let them know of my incredible date with destiny. Text: Going to try Bi Rite! *Note the power of Yelp reviews in my life. It's me and Charlie (My GPS) against the world (San Francisco drivers, sheesh!) looking for street parking on 18th. I walked into Bi Rite market first without confirming the street number. Charlie is always right, always listen to him! A great market, with Bi Rite ice cream available for sale by the pint, but something is wrong, where are the free samples? The adorable family selling organic cherries in front of the market, sold me some cherries and pointed me in the right direction, across the street. Bi Rite is a cool little ice cream shop. A line has formed of well-dressed patrons anxious to buy. I do a double take of my outfit. I didn't know this was a formal occasion or I would have worn more than chap stick, flip flops, n jeans. Eager to sample the legendary stuff, I tried balsamic strawberry, salted caramel, lavender-honey and ginger. I went with salted caramel and lavender-honey. The salted caramel was good and had a darker color with a more burnt taste than I am used to, but salted caramel is a flavor that I can  usually take or leave. The lavender-honey was my favorite, it had a great aftertaste. The texture of this ice cream was not quite as good as my local ice cream shop (Carmela) that accomplishes the same flavor to me. In Bi Rite's version, I came across a tiny ice cube or two. As a person who has sensitive teeth, I hate that! The ginger was strong, it reminded me of the cookie which I miss from childhood. The balsamic strawberry sounded cooler than it tasted to me and left an unpleasant aftertaste. The price tag on this ice cream was a little high, but that is to be expected from gourmet ice cream. Perhaps it is unfair for me to judge this beloved ice cream shop so harshly when I am not a huge fan of sweets to begin with. When it comes to ice cream, I prefer the most bizarre flavors, the most tart fruits, and even worse! I prefer tart yogurt to ice cream most of the time. In honer of my favorite review, of the mecca of reviews I have read for Bi Rite ice Cream, I'll give you my favorite ice cream/ frozen yogurt/gelato/sorbet list in order of preference. #1 Rosemary ice cream, Mama's, Barcelona, Spain. #2 Tomat de arbol gelato, (tomato) Bergerac, Quito, Ecuador. #3 Cherimoya gelato, Marco Polo, San Francisco, CA. #4 Lemongrass and Thai Basil ice cream, Bridges, Danville, CA #5 Lychee sorbet, Joe's, Venice CA #6 Passion fruit-mango frozen yogurt, Nubi, San Gabriel, CA #7 Lemon basil sorbet, Carmela, Pasadena, CA #8 Saffron ice cream, Scoops, Hollywood, CA Orange blossom, rosewater and pistachio ice cream, The Good Food Market, Pasadena, CA #9 Lavender honey ice cream, Bi Rite, San Francisco, CA In closing, I admit that I really do like Bi Rite ice cream. It's just not my favorite. Maybe I have weird taste? Maybe I have bad taste? Don't hate me! *dodges rounds of bullets from the angry mob who disagrees with me* I'm sorry? *waves white flag*

Some say I am too easy with my ratings, but this 4 star is well deserved! A simple ice cream shop may not seem like much, but trust me... this is a great stop! I am a huge fan of anywhere with great service and this place tops my list and one of the best! The workers are very friendly and very patient! There was a bit of a line, yet the workers tried to be very patient and hurried at the same time! The worker to helped me out answered all my questions and even suggested different combinations, depending on the types of flavors I liked. I asked to taste their Salted Caramel, Coffee Toffee, and Mint Chip. All three were quite amazing! I would have ordered a pint, but because I was on a trip, I had no place to store it. I ordered a single size of Salted Caramel and Coffee Toffee, which is a GREAT combination for anybody who loves their ice cream sweet! I started with the Coffee Toffee, which is a simple Jamaican coffee ice cream with nuts and caramel chunks inside. It was a great tasting ice cream, and the crunch that came with the nuts and caramel was a great add-on! Next, everyone's favorite; the Salted Caramel. I've tried other Salted Caramel and I'd put this on about 3rd on my list! Their concentration of flavor explodes into one's mouth, but not enough! It's hard to describe unless you try it yourself. The ice cream's initial taste is very good, but fades a bit too fast. Other cie cream kind of lingers in your mouth to allow you to enjoy the taste til the next bite, but at Birite's, their ice cream forces you to shove bite after bite! Word of advice, unless you're a VERY good parallel parker, let someone's who is drive! It's all street parking and the people here are very stingy with their parking. As I was eating my ice cream, I saw one woman love tap both cars in front and in back SEVERAL times before actually parking her car. So please.... if you can't parallel park, let the better drivers drive.

I love Bi-rite Creamery. That is definitely an understatement. Sometimes you read their flavors and you go "WTF?" but when you give it a try, it's actually quite delicious! Last time I tried a pomegranate sorbet and the famous salted caramel. I loved both of them. The sorbet was refreshing and tarty, while the salted caramel was creamy and rich. I brought my friend there today because she's never been... she is now a fan! :) Today, I tried the orange sorbet and the cookies and cream. The orange sorbet was definitely not like any other orange sorbet I have tried. The orange sorbet had a combination of the bitterness you would get from the skin of an orange while retaining the sweet and tangy flavor you would get from biting into a juicy orange. It was weird. I wish I could say that I loved it, but it was a little too bitter for my liking. On the other hand, the cookies and cream ice cream was delicious. I am a sucker for cookies and cream and this is definitely one of the yummiest ones I've tried. It was full of crunchy cookies and rich in the milk/cream flavor. Definitely a must have again! My friend tried the orange something and the earl gray ice cream. Mmmm, who would've thought of using earl gray tea in their ice cream? It is absolutely delicious. The flavor was light, yet it was just the right amount. I would definitely get a serving of earl gray for myself next time. The staff is amazingly friendly. They are more than welcome to spoon you a sample of your choice(s)! If you go during the day (especially if it's a sunny day and/or the weekend) expect to wait in a line. The line may look intimidating, but it moves rather quickly.

We all know about the awesomesauceness of Bi-Rite, I mean, just look at the reviews. The ratings. The lines. Its all real. But do you know about the national treasure that is their ice cream cake? I would have never found it if my hubby hadn't randomly requested such a calorie bomb for this ?0th birthday last week, a mere three days before the said event. The next morning, I took to Google and Twitter, thinking Humphry-Slocombe and Bi-Rite would be my first choices before I went the *gasp* Baskin-Robbins route. And praise the Lord Bi-Rite answered me almost immediately. I called after a morning meeting and was able to select from one of the three cakes they had in stock for pickup later that evening--malted vanilla with milk chocolate and peanut brittle. WHAT? Its three days since we cut the cake. Its still in my freezer. I've had to add an extra mile onto my runs to work it off because there is no possible way for me not to eat some of it. I think I had some for breakfast this morning.  If you have an occasion calling for ice cream cake (or just decide to make one up) you won't be disappointed. See you on the trails...

Favorites:  Ricanelas, Cookies & Cream, and Salted Caramel.  Each time I go to Bi-Rite and get at least one of those flavors, I'm satisfied with a nice cup of FRESH creamy ice cream!   Ricanelas:  Cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodle chunks. Cookies & Cream:  Vanilla Ice Cream with Oreo chunks Salted Caramel:  Caramel flavored ice cream with a hint of salt to enhance flavor It got one less star because it's such a pain to find parking, and a few times I have gotten skimpy portions.

Oh. Em. Gee. Heaven has arrived on top of a cone. I absolutely love the flavors at Bi-Rite because they are so bold and vibrant. I've had tastes of Earl Grey, Coffee Toffee, Honey Lavender, Mint Chip and Honey Tangerine, all of which make you stop and say "wow, that really does taste like...." HOWEVER, the BEST combination you could possibly dream of making will be found in the marriage of Roasted Banana and Salted Caramel. The banana has the flecks of banana in it and is so true to flavor. The complex caramel has that beautiful rich almost-burnt flavor that good caramel should have. Your taste buds will be confused into blissful oblivion as you savor their delectable love child. It's like bananas foster on steroids. When there's lines, it can be a bit tedious as you wait impatiently for those lame people in front of you to sample every flavor. But keep your cool! This ice cream is worth waiting for.

Ahh Bi-Rite! True to all the hype! Rich, creamy, and true to their flavors! I came here for a pre-dinner dessert with Lucy W. I was prepared for the long line, but it moved rather quickly. Since my friend and I were just visiting the Bay area and figured it would be a long while before we came back, we decided to split 3 scoops so that we could get a whole bunch of flavors. After sampling more than half their flavors (the staff here is very friendly), we got some generous scoops of lavender honey, strawberry balsamic, and pumpkin. While the strawberry balsamic and pumpkin were lip-smacking and smooth, my friend and I both agreed that lavender honey was the favorite. It tastes like a purple meadow out of some feel-good country movie, with the wonderful fragrance of lavender and the sweet flavor of honey. Besides the unparalleled quality of ice cream, I love Bi-Rite because of their local feel and their proximity to other wonderful eateries (Tartine Bakery and Pizzeria Delfina are on the same block), making a really fatty indulgent evening ridiculously easy. **Tip: Parking here is awful, as it is in most parts of San Francisco. We found parking near the park a few blocks west.

This place still serves the best ice cream in San Francisco. I had to come here during my one visit to the city during my trip. They had their fall menu out and I got a 2 scoops of brown butter pecan and maple walnut in a single cup. All very delicious and creamy. My friend also got the brown butter pecan and candy cane. She really liked the butter pecan as well. I was tempted to get their famous salted caramel, but I had it so many times that I wanted to try something new. Until next time...

Yes, it lives up to it's hype. It's right across the street from Dolores Park, perfect for sunny days. Especially sunny week days when everyone is working and there is no line. The Honey Lavender  and Salty Caramel are soooo good. The Cookies and Cream is good, but not hands down amazing. There is a wide range of interesting flavors, and I need to try them all! They also have sundae options....oh my god. Yes please! Will I be back? Of course.

Waited in line for about 45 minutes to get the salted caramel ice cream. It was definitely worth the wait on a hot day. I am not a big ice cream guy but I do admit the ice cream was very good. It was way better than a Baskin Robbins. Slightly better than Cold Stone ( which is pretty good as well) They let you sample the flavors, so you can taste it before actually buying it. The lines can get long I am assuming. It's really nice because there is a park nearby and you can grab ice cream and just chill. If I lived in the city I would probably go occasionally when the weather is nice.

Bi-Rite reminds me why I love ice cream so much, when it's done right, boy is it incredible. I got 2 (hefty) scoops in a cone for around $3 & after taking my first lick I wished I had gotten 3 scoops! I had the the honey lavender, which doesn't taste like soap at all! It's the perfect amount of fragrant & sweet. And I had the malted vanilla with peanut brittle & milk chocolate pieces, great combo. Both flavors perfectly creamy & delish. Parking of course is Darwinian in the mission (survival of the fittest!), but totally worth battling for ice cream!

I love Birite! Parking will always be difficult and there will always be a line, but everything is totally worth it once you take that first lick! The line goes by pretty quickly because the workers are very efficient and friendly. They have all sorts of flavors: Honey Lavender, Salted Caramel, Roasted Coconut etc. They also have basic flavors for ridiculous people like myself. :) They allow you to pick two flavors for the smallest cup. I've tried the Salted Caramel, Honey Lavender, Mint Chip, Vanilla, Cookies and Cream, Toasted Coconut, Roasted Banana, and my absolute favorite.. Ricanelas! There's enough flavoring in each scoop and the consistency of the ice cream is thick and creamy. My least favorite would have to be the Salted Caramel, though. For some reason, it had more of the salty than the sweet. As previously stated, Ricanelas would have to be my absolute favorite! The ice cream was not too sweet and had enough snickerdoodle cookies mixed in. Staff is pretty friendly as well and prices are reasonable for two flavors. I'll definitely be back!

This place gets so packed. Even on chilly, foggy Bay Area weather when it's past good little children's bedtimes there always seems to be a line extending around the corner! It's not surprising considering how good their ice cream is and how nice the employees are. They have such interesting flavors, like: basil, roasted banana, balsamic strawberry, that at first you cringe at the implications of such an invention. But then you summon up the courage to try them and you realize that whoever decided salted caramel would taste good as a frozen, milky treat was a genius! Personally, I always get the honey lavender and ricanelas combination. The flavors compliment each other well, and if not for that fact that ice cream makes me fat I would've bought the bring-home tubs they sell in their freezer. Bi-Rite is the prefect end to a hearty sandwich from Ike's Place. It just completes the whole meal.

Wow, does anywhere have as many reviews as this place?! I've been here 3 times now and am thankful that it's not around the corner from my apartment or I would be here all the time! BiRite has fabulously unique flavors; it's a truly an artisanal ice cream spot. I've tried the salted carmel, balsamic strawberry, brown butter pecan, brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl, and some kind of s'mores sundae if I remember correctly. Everything was intensely flavored and scrumptious! Depending on when you go, you should expect to wait in line. They churn people in and out quickly, though, so even if the line is to the corner, it doesn't take too long to get up to the counter

Salted caramel - need I say more? Even though I love the fact that you can get more than one flavor in a cup, I always end up wishing it was ALL salted caramel. Although having a smidge of another flavor on the side does help me appreciate how delicious the salted caramel is over and over and over. My only complaint is - I've purchased a pint a couple of times now - once from the ice cream shop and once from the market. Both times, the consistency was strange. The whole middle of the pint was melty. I still drank it up, but it was a sort of a bummer considering how much of a luxury it is.

Finally got a chance to try out the ice cream here! With 3900+ reviews, you know it's serious stuff. It was my first time there, but it wasn't hard to find because of the line of people spilling out the door. The line was a little long, but at least it moved quickly. I got a scoop of the Salted Caramel and Honey Lavender on a cone. Both were really good, so I'm glad I got to try a couple of these not so run-of-the-mill flavors. They also have some yummy looking cookies and syrups for sale. If you're in a hurry and don't have time to wait, there are pre-packed pints to all ready to go. There is some seating inside the store, and benches outside to sit on and enjoy your ice cream. The scoops are a bit small, but it's about all quality, not quantity. Parking's a pain, so be prepared to search for a spot and then walk over. Will be back to try some other flavors!

The verdict is in...  I'm still torn between Bi-Rite Creamery and Humphrey Slocombe's.  Honestly, it's all about their signature ice creams.  I am still a big fan of Humphrey's Secret Breakfast (so, they tip the scale for me at 4-1/2 stars, if there were such a thing)... Nevertheless, this is a review of Bi-Rite, and the experience was great.  After waiting about 10 minutes in line, I ordered two double portions of salted caramel (sweet n' savory) / honey lavendar (mellow and aromatic), roasted banana (awesome banana flavor) / toasted coconut (great texture).  All were good, but my wife and I really liked the toasted coconut (we will be back to pick up a pre-packed pint).

In SF we're quite lucky to be able to head over to Bi-Rites soft-serve window with NO LINE, then soft-serve in hand - head over to the real LONG LINE for their ice cream! ;) Salted Caramel may still be #1 in my book, but there are other close contenders! Ricanelas with bits of Snickerdoodle cookies - I love Ricanelas but this should just be named Snickerdoodle cause it totally captured the flavor of it. Roasted Banana - I love anything made with real bananas - not artificial, and this is another one to add to the list. So deliciously light and creamy! Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl - I only like ginger when it's muted, cause it's so strong to begin with. In this flavor, it's perfect cause the sweetness of the brown sugar balances it quite well! Honey Lavender - It's confirmed - honey makes everything better! I don't like floral flavors in anything I eat, but these flavors both taste so natural. ... One day, I have to just skip that soft-serve window so I'll have room for their sundaes that look ohhh, sooo goood =)

Their salted caramel ice cream was the best ice cream ever invented. every single lick is breaks my heart because i know eventually that this delicious creation will come to an end. i dont even mind waiting in line because the wait isn't too bad. and if i'm in a hurry, i buy it by the pint, so i can enjoy my bi-rite from the comfort of my own home. their brown sugar is pretty good too for those not a fan of caramel. but i seriously wouldn't comprehend why anyone wouldn't enjoy this satisfying treat.

Ya dude, the hype is NOT over the top. Got in line around 4:45, which did extend around the corner from the shop. It really only took about 15-20 mins though, and mind you it was a sunny Saturday afternoon. Worth the wait -- and if you're in good company, who cares? Didn't get the salted caramel like everyone said, I've had so many and sometimes its just too sweet for me still. But I got the malted vanilla with brittle and the toasted coconut. Oh my LANTA the toasted coconut was pretty delicious. My friend and I walked over to Dolores to eat our ice cream while the rest of the park goers lit up and played with their dogs. Will definitely return, even on the weekend. Maybe, especially on the weekend.

The biggest attraction to this place is that they offer fun and exotic flavors like basil, lavender, and snickerdoodle! HOWEVER, the quality of the ice cream is mostly a matter of preference...if you like ice cream that is light and icy, and not too sweet then this is the place for you! If you are more like me, and you like your ice cream to have some substance (i.e. heavy, rich and creamy) well, I've tried at least 6 different flavors here and none of them offer that. Also, I like my ice cream to be almost frozen hard, and the texture at Bi-rite is more like what you'd expect a thick milkshake to be. TIP: Eat your ice cream fast! I noticed that the ice cream often melts and falls apart in the cone before you can finish it. Also, be prepared to wait in line for at LEAST half an hour.

After strolling around Noe Valley & the Mission I had to stop by Bi-Rite on our way past Dolores. Honestly, I feel like I'm in a slightly grungier Zooey Deschanel movie when I'm in the neighborhood and I can't get enough! Also couldn't get enough of the Earl Grey Tea and Roasted Banana. Every flavor here is very robust, especially the Coffee Toffee and Salted Caramel which makes those two good for sharing even if I wouldn't order it again just for myself.

Really enjoyable ice cream experience despite the lines outside while we were there. The ice cream sandwich we had was the chocolate cookie with mint ice cream that was really refreshing. The cookies were good and the ice cream had solid real mint flavor. We also split a coffee/salted caramel dish and both flavors were right on point. Loved the take out window for quicker service especially with how many people were in line. Absolutely no issues with Bi-Rite and I would definitely go back.

We showed up here on the Friday night after Thanksgiving, and the line was well out the door and down the (cold, cold, cold!) street. This was my first clue that this was the place to go for some great ice cream. I had the S'mores sundae. Chocolate ice cream, graham cracker bits, caramel, and a fluffy cloud of meringue that was toasted with a blowtorch right before my very eyes. It was incredibly good, and my three ice-cream-enjoying comrades all commented, after tasting my s'mores sundae, that they wished they had gotten one instead of what they ordered (although all of theirs were delicious, too). The price of the sundae was $7 flat, and I got so much that, even after sharing, I had leftovers in our hotel room freezer the next day. Yep, I ate them.

I'm not even putting in 2 cents since 1/4000 reviews is about .02 cents, but here goes anyway... Great people, good ice cream. The only issue is that its just not very creamy - a bit icy, but their flavors are great: -Salted caramel - Tasty but insanely sweet -Mint chip - Average -Honey Lavender - Subtle, not overpowering, and delicious - one of the best "weird" flavors I've had -Almond Swirl - Really almondy, very good -Roasted Banana - Tastes exactly like a roasted banana -Chocolate coconut - You can really taste the toasted coconutiness, yum -Brown butter pecan - An average butter pecan -Malted vanilla w/ peanut brittle & choco - Tastes like a candy bar -Dark Chocolate - Good basic dark chocolate -Ricanelas (cinnamon & snickerdoodles) - Subtle, surprisingly not too sweet -Brown Sugar Ginger Caramel Swirl - Very very sweet Save yourself the wait in what looks like a line to a club, and go to the Bi-Rite store across the street that sells quarts of ~10 of their most popular flavors. You can eat the whole quart, you know you can...

Bf and I walked right in on a Wednesday afternoon. I tried the Roasted Banana just because I was curious. I already knew what I wanted: SALTED CARAMEL!! It made my dreams come true. So creamy and delicious. One scoop in a cone is all you need. Unless you are bf. In that case, you need the scoop of Salted Caramel in a cone. Then you finish that, get back in line, and get one scoop of Chocolate in a cone. Recommended it to the rest of our family in town, and we would definitely be in trouble if we lived near this place.

The perfect balance of ice and cream - really.  It's indulgent, but not overly creamy.  I had the pumpkin with the brown sugar.  Fantastic! I did get some of their homemade caramels.  I think I got a bad batch as mine were crunchy (because of the sugar crystals).

Oh.My.God. This is perhaps the best ice cream I've ever had. Arriving on a early Monday night, there was no line. Yes, no line up. All these flavours, I needed to quickly narrow down what I wanted. Trying out different flavours-salted caramel, brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl, malted vanila.... Finally, I decided on honey lavender, creme fraiche, and balsamic strawberry, on a sugar cone. This was amazing. Honey lavender was the perfect amount of sweetness, creme fraiche was creamy and sweet, and the balsamic strawberry, a light hint of the balsamic bringing the freshness of the strawberry flavour out. Making me super happy, I seriously wanted to ship some pints home!

BEST ICE CREAM XD i love the salted caramel, it has a very strong and unique flavor. It's their number one flavor. Also love the brown sugar with ginger. the hint of ginger goes very well with it. The one with snickerdoodles is yummy too especially for cinnamon lovers. Coffee toffee is another favorite. I did not like their honey lavender because I don't really like floral foods. I wish this place was closer to me too! Or okay, it's close enough, but parking is such a pain over there. :/  But this place is a MUST GO TO PLACE. I will come here over ghiradelli any day.

LOVE LOVE LOVE...it's worth the line and the crazy parking. But for serious ice cream fiends like us, we purposely make the trek to the City from the Peninsula whenever it rains - so we can get our Bi-Rite fix much faster =) These are intensely and authentically flavored, rich, luscious, dreamy ice creams. Our favorites include Earl Grey, Salted Caramel, Roasted Banana, and Toasted Coconut. Now stop reading. Go to Bi-Rite. Now.

Yummy! I'm not a huge fan of ice cream (I know, the horror, right?) but I did enjoy the salted caramel and pumpkin flavor ^^ I went at an obscure hour of roughly 2:30 pm so there was no line, so quick and attentive service yay! Only downside? Kinda pricey :( Also I like this place better than Ici's in Berkeley since it has more...acceptable flavors, shall we say? Haha like actual flavors that make sense in ice cream, not some weird concoction of walnuts and mint and tea and God knows what else.

Ladies and gentleman, I am the 3,953rd person to stand in that line and write a Yelp review. To wait, determined, and see if it's all worth it. Or if it's all a cruel joke. Like Senior Prom. I did it. I really did. And here's the deal: Ice cream is good in all forms. So, right away, Bi-Rite is positioned to be awesome. But, their flavors are unique and intense. Super creamy and dense. The salted caramel tastes like burnt sugar and salted butter. The basil was incredible. The chocolate was thick and fudgy. Amazing. I'm afraid that my cynical evil twin is wrong about this place, and despite this being somewhat of a Mission tourist destination, it's still totally legit.

This place gets crazy good business. ALL. THE. TIME. I mean c'mon, people are lining out in the cold, freezing rain to buy and eat cold, freezing ice cream? Where's the logic in that? THERE IS NONE! Therefore... this place must be good. Right? Came here last weekend looking to pig out and have some delicious hyped-up ice cream. I chose the salted caramel and balsamic strawberry flavors in a single cup and teammate got cookies n' cream and chocolate. Cookies n' cream totally beat out the salted caramel. The salted caramel tasted more like burnt caramel. :(

In general, it's already really hard to say no to ice cream, but if it's Bi-Rite, it's just that much harder. I will go even if I am about to explode from a filling dinner (which was the case during my last trip to Bi-Rite). The line is usually long, but it goes pretty quickly. It's best if you "tag team" it so that someone gets in line while the other person gets parking, because parking in this area is an absolute nightmare. That's really the only thing that stops me from coming here. Yes, I love all the flavors that people talk about: salted caramel, balsamic strawberry, earl grey,... the list goes on. I "like" the honey lavender, but it wouldn't be my first choice. Some people I know say that it tastes like soap, but I think it's just a taste preference. My biggest piece of advice: Try anything, even if it sounds weird! Last time, I decided to sample their olive oil ice cream. I never expected to like it so much -- enough to actually get a scoop of it! If you're too full, take a container to go!

I finally got to experience Bi-Rite ice cream for the first time last week. I went with a few friends on a Monday afternoon and of course there was a line. I ordered salted caramel (of course) and coffee and they were both delicious. The creaminess and sweetness of their ice cream is perfect. My boyfriend got three flavors: coconut, banana & salted caramel and he liked all of them. I took away one star because after reading the yelp reviews, I REALLY wanted to try the balsamic strawberry but it wasn't on the menu.

I am absolutely positively 100% obsessed with this place. I have not tried a single bad thing here. I've tried: -strawberry balsamic -brown sugar -ricanelas -salted caramel -sundae with chocolate ice cream, verbena infused olive oil and sea salt It is ALL creamy, dreamy chilled perfection in a cup (or cone, if you prefer).

I am normally not a huge fan of ice cream, but I am love this place.  I was urged by a friend to check out this place during my trip to SF.  I am so glad I listened to him. A line outside the door for ice cream?  This must be good.  I tried their salted caramel and lavender ice cream.  It was amazing!  I could really taste the lavender in the ice cream.  The salted caramel was everything it should be:  sweet, salty, creamy...yum!  I definitely recommend trying this place of you're ever in the area.

I always swore I would never line up for anything in my life-- but not in the case of really delicious ice-cream. The line today went around the building.... AHH!! Honey-Lavender - I thought it was going to taste like soap but it didn't. The flavor was very light and balanced. Salty Caramel was delicious & flavorful. Balsamic Strawberry taste like regular strawberry icecream but better, you can't go wrong with that. This place is near Dolores Park & Mission High School. Parking can extremely suck, have fun!

WTF! Over 4000+ Yelp reviews...We've gotta try this place out. Super delicious Balsamic Strawberry and Salted Caramel...flavors!!! You definitely have to visit during the off peak time. Weekdays vs weekends. The line that goes around the block looked like a velvet rope VIP night club line. Oh my... it's just ice cream. The samples were fun, but I felt the pressure to choose quickly from the hungry crowd breathing down my neck behind me. The seating area is very limited and tight. Tip: Bring an Igloo cooler and buy some pints of ice cream "to go" for a late night dessert at home!!! Cheers!!!

It is so worth standing in the insanely long lines for. Hands down best ice cream I've ever eaten. Dear Bi-Rite, please don't ever leave.

Love, LOVE it! Does it get much better than Snickerdoodle ice cream with chunks of snickerdoodle cookies? I got two scoops!

With so many reviews, it seems unnecessary for me to add to it.  BUT i have to show my love for my favorite ice cream store!! They are known for their salted caramel ice cream, but I like their roasted banana, earl grey, and MEYER LEMON.  Meyer Lemon is only around once a year for about 3 weeks (I believe around March or April).  I have not found an ice cream that I've liked better, if you ever go and this flavor is available.  Buy a pint or you will regret it because the next time you're back it probably will not be available anymore.   I've also gotten their Banana split sundae, which they caramelize with a small blow torch, love it! I've also tried their frozen yogurt which they opened next door.  Their yogurt is very  flavorful and not at all diluted by a "yogurty" taste that I find in so many frozen yogurt. This is my go-to recommendation for anyone living/visiting SF.  So please brave the line (taught me patience so that no line for food has phased me since) and the SF cold to get this ice cream.  Parking again around this area is very difficult, but be patient and something always opens up.

A few doors down from the line that stretches to the end of the block is the Bi-Rite Creamery window with no line:  Soft-serve Bi-Rite coming right up!!  J and I were walking down the block moments later, right past the 45 minute line, licking our spoons of their vanilla and balsamic strawberry soft-serve topped with dark chocolate (J) and caramel (me). Even though it's right there for anyone to see, I think this place sort of qualifies as a secret.  I was already walking off my Bi-Rite soft-serve before all of those other people even had theirs.   2 flavors each day, all sorts of toppings, and when I was done my lips (and thighs and hips)  were coated in rich, creamy butter-fat.   $8.50 for 2, each with a topping. They even feature "salted caramel soft-serve on Wednesdays and Sundays.   Why wait, literally?

Wow, this place rocks!!! You know this place has to be amazing if there is a line outside the establishment going on twenty people deep. All this for ice cream!! My favorites at Bi-Rite Creamery are the Toasted Coconut and Balsamic Strawberry. Rich and deep flavors with a fantastic creamy texture. According to some of the regulars we talked to in that long line, the Salted Caramel is very good and popular. Once you get inside they also sell fresh baked cookies bagged up. I took a bag of 6 chocolate chip cookies for my flight to Vegas the next day. The cookies were not too sweet, which I prefer. The cookies also had that complex texture of soft, crispy and chewy throughout that I love! The employees here are very friendly! They don't get annoyed when you ask to sample the many unique flavors they offer. Prices are reasonable. Also, right across the street from Dolores Park which is a great place during nice days out. This place is definitely worth a try!

I finally tried the Haagan-Dazs salted caramel truffle and it was a flunk. Even after Super Taster on http://Chow.com gave it a thumbs up, I found the vanilla cream part uncharacteristically sandy, not smooth. There was salt and sweet but no actual caramel flavor in both the swirls and inside the chocolate truffles. If you want salted caramel in ice cream form, Bi-Rite's salted caramel is as good as it gets!

Really didn't find the ice cream all that spectacular, but still it was a good ice cream.  Flavors change on a daily basis, so the menu is constantly different which is good.  Reasonably priced, good to go if your in the neighborhood.  I don't think I would make a special trip for it, but its a nice place for dessert if you just ate an awesome sandwich up the street at Ike's Place.  Or if you just want some ice cream to eat while you lounge in Delores Park.

I scream for Ice Cream! Though I can't see myself waiting an hour in line for this ice cream...I can definitely see myself waiting a little bit longer in line than I would at some other ice cream joints.  I honestly, didn't think it would be that great but I best believe the hype because it delivered and delivered good... I tried the maple walnut and salted caramel my first time here.  Whew wee...this be some good shit.  The ice cream was smooth and cutting through the ice cream with the spoon felt like I was cutting through some warm butter with a knife.  No forceful stabbing needed here.  Eating the ice cream was just as fun as slicing it with my spoon.  It was soft and not overpowering with sweetness at all.  Just the right flavor combination that it felt refreshing rather than just eating a spoonful of sugar given the flavors I picked.  My friends and I all agreed that this was some pretty bomb ice cream.  One friend actually made us swear not to tell his wife about this place because he knew that she'd make him drive all the way to city weekly to get this ice cream.  So lets hope she doesn't read this review...ever. The staff here was another positive.  They're just so energetic (but not in an annoying way) that one can't help but be put in a good mood when walking in.  I'll definitely have to come back to this place to try all the other flavors they have.  Bi-Rite Creamery...I will see you again!

:o :) :D :'( Were my faces during this awesome experience. I can safely say that this was the best ice cream I've ever had. East coaster stamp of approval. It was pretty late and night and I was surprised by the line that was forming out the door. Don't fret! The service people manage to keep the line moving amazingly fast while dealing with those indecisive people who insist on trying every flavor (that would normally be me but I was too hungry). Happy about the roasted banana. There was such a strong flavor of banana, but not in an off-putting way. Perfectly creamy and the real kicker was when my scoop of roasted banana combined with the salted caramel. The combo is seriously so heavenly you want to stop time and/or move into Bi-Rite ice cream freezer and sleep next to the cartons of ice cream for the rest of your life. Sadface for realizing that I won't be back in SF for a while. But the next time I do i'm taking a taxi straight from the airport to Bi-Rite.

Apparently, I really lucked out because I came here on a Sunday afternoon around 5:30 and only had 2 people in front of me in line. The salted caramel is as good as the Internet says it is, and I liked the coffee ice cream, too. Between Bi-Rite, Humphry Slocombe, Tartine and the abundance of Mexican food in the Mission, I'm not sure what I'd do if I lived there.

I really like that Bi-Rite Creamery makes their own ice cream by hand. They have really interesting flavors that tastes very rich.  It's located right next to Delores park, so you can walk over and enjoy your ice cream in a nice area. My roommate and I tried a few of their flavors: Salted Caramel, Dark Chocolate, Malted Vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate pieces, and Coffee Toffee. Our favorites were the Dark Chocolate and Malted Vanilla. The coffee toffee was interesting, it tasted like I was drinking a cup of iced coffee! Salted Caramel was good but definitely a bit too sweet for my tastes, though others really LOVED it.  A random couple sitting next to use insisted that I try their Salted Caramel with extra caramel sauce on it... can we say sugar rush? Definitely will come back to try their other flavors.

I was complaining that my BF hadn't taken me to the most yelped place in the nation yet. After enough whining, we ended up here on a Saturday night. When yelp tells me it was my second check in at Bi-Rite, the memories start flowing. The familiar setting of Delores Park across the street, the long line that winds around the corner.. oooohhhhhh.. I have been here! Anyway, I sampled a couple of flavors and went with salted caramel and ricanelas. Definitely happy with my choice. I also got to try the honey lavender, which is a clean refreshing flavor. Their ice cream is perfectly creamy and the unique flavors are such a selling point. If long lines and hard to find street parking scare you, then go ahead and go home and be deprived. For the rest of us, see you at Bi-Rite!

Does anyone remember that ridiculously warm day we experienced about two weeks ago? I believe the weekend of October 22nd will be remembered for many reasons- but let's all keep in mind the sweatastic weather we had! After a lovely pic-a-nic lunch in Dolores Park, my girlfriend and I decided to try Bi-Rite Creamery. It was hot, we were hot, and who doesn't love ice cream? Bi-rite seems to have two locations...one of which offers a plethora of flavors, and one of which just offers a few. We looked at the line. We stood in the line. We decided we were in favor of deciding upon one flavor and just spliting a pint. So we did (and we got to skip the line!!!!) We tried the Salted Caramel- which I believe to be Bi-Rite's famous flavor. It was different- but so delicious! It definitely is more sugary than most ice-creams (they even state this on the freezer door) so it's hard to eat a lot of. We ended up donating half the pint to the homeless man on the corner. I would absolutely venture back to Bi-Rite to try more of their ice cream...I'm just not sure I can get over the line.

There are currently (as of this post) over 4400 reviews, so what more can I really say? This ice cream really is worth waiting in line for.  Their gourmet and unexpected creations and combinations really make the calories worth it.  Honey lavender?  Brown butter pecan? The only drawback is that the ice cream must be REALLY very salty, because when you are done you can drink 5902 glasses of water and still feel thirsty.  This is probably not the place for you if you need to avoid sodium or saturated fat.  But then again, what ice cream place isn't?

I think I died and went to heaven. That's really the only way I can describe how good this place is.  I've had some really good homemade ice cream, but never this good.   First and foremost, the portions are pretty generous.  You can order a double, and get 3 flavors.   I ordered 3 flavors: honey lavender, ginger, and salted caramel. Honey lavender is as it sounds.  Herbaly, light, fragrant.  Not overpowering. Ginger was good.  Lots of bite, spicy notes, brings back memories of getting ginger ice cream for dessert at this Japanese restaurant my family used to frequent when I was younger.  But so much better, because it's super creamy. Salted caramel.  Smokey. Dark. Sweet. Savory.  Creamy.  Delicious.  Mind blowing.   I am so glad I made the trip from downtown just to go here. There's not a lot of seating on the inside, but there is also some limited seating outside as well. I can't wait for another excuse to come up and visit.

OK dude. This place lives up to the hype. I think the wait is WELL worth it, and to me, it's not that bad since I usually go with friends anyway. It makes it more delicious and satisfying in the end =) There are a bunch of flavors so no matter what you're feeling, you'll probably have something you want. So far, I've tried salted caramel, honey lavender, and.. the ricanella.. (I think).. I also tried some of my bf's banana split. I have LOVED. They are all not too overpowering and the texture is just right. Not too heavy, but not too light like you got ripped off. Hahaha. I forgot how much it costs. Either way, it is worth it because I feel satisfied in my tummy and on my taste glands.... One thing to note for the sundae or banana split or whatever my BF got. They actually GRILLED the banana and got a li'l crust / shell of caramelization on it which was frickin' perfect.. I want to buy their ice cream cakes one day =)

Luckily my friends had to push back our brunch by 30 minutes which gave me time for a pit stop at Bi Rite! Ice cream followed by bottomless mimosas... I couldn't have planned a better day!! Anyway I judge every ice cream shop by 1 flavor which is mint chocolate chip. This is my favorite flavor and a basic which is why I feel it is an excellent flavor to judge a shop on. Bi Rite did not disappoint with their mint chip!  It was slightly better than the mint chip I had at Joe's in the Inner Richmond. It was just a tad bit better but I didn't have to wait 20 minutes at Joe's! Once inside the store service was quick and friendly. They even asked if I wanted a sample! I didn't expect that considering the long line but I took advantage of the offer! I sampled the almond fudge which was delicious.   To sum up: Long lines but well worth it! Also if it hasn't already been mentioned they are opening up another shop on Divisadero. I'm still deciding which neighborhood to move to in SF but when I heard this NoPa made it to the top of my list :) I'm only half kidding, I really love my ice cream!

We came here on a sunday breezy afternoon, waited in line and finally got my bi-rite fix for the first time.  The ice cream here is a bit pricey. They have a buyer's frequent card.  It's too bad I don't live in the city or i'd get one!  I tried two flavors, cherry chocolate and salty caramel. O.. M ..G... the salty caramel... where have you been all my life??

Since there's been a gajillion reviews written already, I won't even comment on the ice cream (ok, I will, the balsamic strawberry is my favorite).   I will comment instead on some less touted items, namely the soft serve (WAY shorter line, beautifully creamy, 2 flavors, changes daily).  And as of yesterday I am a HUGE fan of their popcicles.  I had the raspberry-- holy crap, its like eating frozen jam.  It was delicious!  I had it because I'm kind of on a diet, but nothing healthy tastes that good so it probably was a wash.  But it was a bargain ($1.95!) and it was amazing.

- Taste: Fantastic - Value: Good for the quality, but its about 3.50 for two scoops. - Service: Staff are very friendly. - Wait: The not fun part.  You can skip the line if you buy prepackage pint/quart.  (Brings friends to share that pint.  It's too tempting eat a pint of Bi-Rite's ice-cream) I had the balsamic strawberry and honey levanda.  Look forward to try other flavors in the future.

This has inspired me to dust off my ice cream maker!  You know the one you bought at a Bed, Bath and Beyond and swore you'd use over and over again, but didn't after the first couple months of said purchase?   This place inspired me because it is honest to goodness real homemade ice cream.  Within the first lick you can tell that it's a creamy dreamy homemade mixture!  I was in pure ice cream heaven! My coconut senses were tingling (you know, like spidey senses) and I ordered the coconut ice cream (they also had a chocolate choice, but I'm a weirdo and not into choco ice cream).  It was pure magic!  Creamy vanilla/coconut base and toasted coconut flakes mixed in.   The "one scoop" is actually two, so be warned if you're stuffed from dinner (of course me) and want something small, it's not.  And if you're greedy and want the mother load (like I usually am), you WILL in fact get the mother load of ice cream! There was a good amount of unique flavors to choose from, so I'd doubt you'd be hard up to find your perfect ice cream combo.  I wouldn't doubt I'd find a good match in many of them.  Although, it's never that hard with me and ice cream.  We're a perfect match and so is this place for me and probably you, fellow ice cream lover!   So now I'll head back to Pittsburgh in search of a place like this or maybe actually use my lonely ice cream maker!

What everyone says is accurate. What more can I add to this!? I wasn't a fan of the honey lavender (I don't like eating ice cream with the after taste of eating my lotion) but it is very great if you love the fragrant of lavender. I instead had the OLIVE OIL. My goodness, this was not what I expected at all. Just try it. However, don't try the Basil, which was what they recommended with the olive oil. The ice cream melted fairly quickly compared to other ice cream's I've had, so that was a bummer. All in all, great eclectic flavors, amazing staff (they gave me samples to every flavor!) and great location. Wait in line,  look at the menu that's passed down to you while you're in line, try as many flavors as possible, and pick one or two or more as quickly as you can so others can join in the goodness too, and make your way to Dolores Park with ice cream in hand! Great itinerary!

I can say going to get an Ice-cream from BiRite is a complete excuse in itself, to travel to San Francisco from the east bay. The last Saturday was a gorgeous sunny weekend day and despite the long lines - a scoop each of Earl Gray, Orange/Cardamom and Honey/Lavender, topped with Olive oil, made it a spring day worth remembering for a long time to come!

I tried this place for the first time a few weeks ago and have been back 3 times. Which is big for me, as I can be lazy and typically hang out around my Hayes Valley surroundings. I've not even been to the fancy part that always has the line and I'm still hooked. I've had the strawberry ice cream (which was sooo good and I usually *loathe* fruit ice cream) as well as the coconut (another thing I thought I hated - this place is making me question everything I previously thought, for real) and chocolate. The girl behind the counter is always super helpful and friendly. And this is just for the little window-hole place, not the proper creamery where you walk in and order fancy things. I'm holding off on going there for as long as possible, as I already go at least once a week with the "plain" stuff.

I love ice cream. Hot days, cold days, rainy days...its a good time for ice cream. Bi-rite's flavors are delicious. Lets just say if I were to only have Salted Carmel ice cream or Coffee Toffee for the rest of my life I'd be fine with that. Lines can get long. There is also a Bi-Rite market a block away that sells the pints if you're just looking to grab and go.

Came here yesterday for the first time with friends after lunch at Delfina. I guess we got really lucky because the line moved so quickly, I didn't even have time to decide what I wanted! There was so many unique flavors like honey lavender, olive oil, earl's grey, coffee toffee, salted caramel...etc etc etc! I ended up getting the oh-so raved about Salted Caramel with the Malted Vanilla. I definitely enjoyed the Salted caramel more than the vanilla but it was a good mixure. I plan to come back often to try all of the other flavors! Yum!

The atmosphere is really cute I got a double scoop, one of their Ricanelas and Coffee Toffee. It was sooooo good. Their coffee ice cream was like drinking a cup of coffee. If i didn't live so far i would have bought a bunch of tubs of ice cream... When i went, the line was not long, but I can see it getting long since the flavors are quite unique. Everyone will be wanting to try it. I tried probably 3/4 of all the flavors they had out. We probably held up the line, but hey, how often will i get to eat here when im from socal! (:

Bi-Rite is a delightful treat not to be missed in San Francisco's Mission District The first creation I tried at Bi-Rite was Sam's Sundae: chocolate ice cream with bergamot olive oil, maldon sea salt, and whipped cream. We saw this treat on Food Network's show, "The Best Thing I Ever Ate." Now, let me be honest.. I LOVE Bi-Rite, but Sam's Sundae is definitely only for the adventurous. It didn't please my palate all that much; I enjoyed the sea salt and chocolate ice cream, but the addition of olive oil was a little too exotic for me. Most of the flavors I've tried at Bi-Rite are funky, fresh, and fun. With flavors ranging from Vanilla, Roasted Banana, Honey Lavender, Balsamic Strawberry, and Mint Chocolate Chip, there's something there for the uber-adventurous and the ultra-safe. My favorites include Creme Fraiche and Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl . Next time you're in San Francisco, grab a scoop of ice cream and head to the sunny, grassy hills of Dolores Park, which is right around the corner.

Soft Serve. Even a runny nose and a persistent cold couldn't keep me away. Something about going into an ice-cream shop that makes me revert back to a 5 year old adamant on having one (or many) no matter what my state may be. And given my persistence, combined with no lines and a brisk wednesday night, with a kind face in the soft serve window, I decided to give the 'twist' a try. The twist is the famous salted caramel and vanilla, twisted. Seeing how I like to optimize the varying choices available, this seemed like the best bet. And for the price they offer it for, it's a pretty decent sized portion! Now I have to be honest - I am not a big fan of their salted caramel. I tried it first at the street food festival and didn't like it and gave it another chance here and didn't particular find a great liking to it either. But it's creamy, soft (it serves the whole soft serve thing well) and rich. As was the vanilla. Not a usual fan of the vanilla, I found it great! I also walked into the actual creamery to see the varying choices and man are there many. The soft serve counter changes their specials everyday so check on their website for what's available, but the creamery offers plenty of choices along with pints of goodness! The sundaes especially looked quite amazing. Overall, I'm sooo happy I don't live that close to this place. Combined with my inertia to do any physical activity with my love for ice cream, my mother would say, can never be a good combination. Great place! Love it :)

My first experience at Bi-Rite I tried the Strawberry Balsamic. I thought it was good, but not "that good" to command the ridiculously long line I see out the door every weekend. Somehow I went back and tried the Salted Caramel, Ricanella, Honey Lavender, and Ginger. OMG! I don't think I've had better ice cream than Bi-Rite's Salted Caramel. Not usually a caramel fan, I was surprised by how much I ended up loving it. The touch of salt in the caramel and the restraint in sweetness makes this a flavor for the grown up taste buds. The other flavors were also very good and way better than Strawberry Balsamic, but I consider them sidekicks to my obvious favorite. If you love bananas in your ice cream, I highly recommend the banana split. They torch the sugar coated halved bananas to make a crispy caramel coating as you order. It is then drizzled with fudge, sprinkled with pecans, and topped with real whipped cream. When the line extends to the corner of 18th and Dolores, you've got about a 20 minute wait until you get to the yummy yum yums!

If an ice cream place has a weird/out of the ordinary flavors...this is how they become big. Bi-Rite is very similar to Penny's Creamery in Santa Cruz (they serve organic and unique flavors as well). The line is super long, but moves fairly quickly. They use real spoons when giving samples. I had to think fast when I was here so I wouldn't hold up the line. I ended up with a cup of Toasted Coconut and Mint Chocolate Chip ice cream. Really creamy and exotic. The toasted coconut had real coconut shavings in them. The mint chocolate chip was very refreshing. Their ice cream is just unexplainable. TRY IT. The service is really friendly and they aren't stingy on the samples. There are a good amount of flavors to choose from, that I guarantee you can't find anywhere else. Balsamic Strawberry? Honey Lavender? What the.... come to Bi-Rite! This is where it's at! Oh yeah, you can even make your own ice cream sandwiches!

Possibly my favorite ice cream of all time! I just came back from a weekend in San Francisco and I'm so glad I got to try Bi-Rite. It took two tries. The first night, we arrived right at closing time and they didn't allow any more people to stand in the long line going out the door. We decided to come back the next day, and I'm so happy that we did. We waited about 20 minutes. - Salted caramel: SOO good!! Definitely a must try. - Honey lavender: Light & not too flowery tasting. - Brown sugar w ginger: Really good. Tastes similar to the salted caramel. - Roasted banana: Very strong banana flavor. I liked this one the least out of the flavors I tried. I LOVED the salted caramel and brown sugar. Seriously SOOO good! I've been craving Bi-Rite ever since I got back home from SF. I want it nowww.

I think with all the reviews and being on the food network for "The Best Thing I've Ever Ate," I don't need to write a long and detailed review. The ratings speak for themselves. I think you can't go wrong with ANY of the flavors but I got the Salted Carmel and Brown Butter Pecan. This place is a must try and the wait is well worth it.

After hearing about all the hype about this place, I had to go try it for myself to see how good it is. Picking a nice sunny day to go was kind of a bad decision. The line for Bi-Rite wrapped around the block and it was a 30 minute wait to get scoops of ice cream. San Francisco rarely gets a nice sunny day around this time... everyone and their mom was in line for ice cream. Everyone who came out from the store were saying it was worth the long wait. In my mind I was picturing myself shaking my fist at the ice cream scoop and saying this better be worth it. After reading reviews on how good the salted caramel and balsamic strawberry are, I chose to get those two flavors in my single bowl. After the first lick of the salted caramel, my taste buds were sent into space. The ice cream scoops were really creamy and the flavor is out of this world good! It took a few seconds for my taste buds to crash land back and slap my mouth out of shock to start nom-ing again. Gone is 60 seconds was what happened to the salt caramel. It didn't even stand a chance. The flavor was initially caramel sweet, then some salty aftertaste. Just a perfect combo. The balsamic strawberry scoop was good, but not out of this world amazing. There's a really powerful strawberry taste that seems to be overpowering sometimes. There's just too much strawberry, which left me wondering where the balsamic vinegar taste went. I'm a big fan of strawberries, but this was just too much for me. I also picked up a Lorina sparking blood orange soda, which was disappointing. The soda has a 2% of blood orange juice content, which made it taste a bit like blood orange, but more of a sugary soda taste. I had better sparking blood orange soda with 40ish% of blood orange juice that tasted more like blood orange. Would I wait 30 minutes again for Bi-Rite? HELL YES! I would wait an hour for this if necessary. Bi-Rite's ice cream is holding my taste buds hostage now and I need to go back to reclaim them.

Fantastic ice cream with Disneyland line-worthy wait times Been here many times. Review on most recent couple trips. SWEETS: Olive oil ice cream Yuuuuuuuuummmmmmm! ^____^ Super smooth, creamy, fragrant. Not over-powering olive oil taste. It's just perfect. Mango sorbet Refreshing, but the mangoes weren't as sweet as I'd like. Brown sugar with caramel Strong burnt caramel taste. A bit more intense than I'd like for a scoop of ice cream. Kid's scoop (1 flavor, 1 cup) $2.50 Midnight coffee chocolate cupcake $2.50 Chocolate cake was so-so moist and chocolatey. I prefer more moist and soft. The frosting was super hard and dense and more sugary than I like. The cocoa nibs added a fun crunch to the cupcake, but overall my boyfriend and I both agree that this cupcake was meh. Kara's Cupcakes and Love at First Bite still top our list. AMBIANCE: Small ice cream palor with quite a long line that makes me think I'm in line at Disneyland, anticipating awesomeness. Bright, cheerful, and kitchen-homely interior. Just further down is their soft serve and bakery take-out window, where I got my cupcake. There's no line there...if you dare forego some wondrous ice cream. SERVICE: Fine VISIT DETAILS: Cupcake as dessert after dinner at LIttle Star Pizza, then afternoon ice cream break in Dolores Park the following day

I LOVEEEE BI-RITE! You guys deserve 10 stars! If i lived in San Francisco, I would come here everyday! The very first time I came here I tried their Earl Grey! They have such exotic flavors. Then I wanted to come back for their Earl Grey, but sadly it was only seasonal. I gave salted caramel and honey lavender a try! They also became my favorite. Now they have a new flavor called Basil. To die for! Every time I'm in the city, I must come here for ice cream. Bi-rite closes at 10 and you see a long line even around 9:50 and it's still freezing outside. Ice cream here is THAT good. Let it rain, let it snow, I will still stand in line for bi-rite!

The line is always long, no matter what time of day, but it moves very quickly.  I like how they use metal spoons if you want to taste.  All of the flavors are good, but I usually end up getting the brownie sundae because it's really really good!  The workers are also super nice and sweet.   There's not a lot of seating inside, but you can enjoy your ice cream at the big park across the street. I love taking my little brother here.  He always gets happy we go here, and when he's happy, I'm happy :)

I've tried most of the ice creameries around SF, and finally got to try Bi-Rite. The place wasn't too packed on a Friday evening, so that's a plus. Found parking right away, always good since there's only meters and street parking around. My favorites are the brown sugar with ginger and caramel. Hard to believe but I don't particularly like ginger, but it's a mild flavor so this I can eat plenty. I tried their coffee flavor, but I like the creamy textures of the Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee of Humphrey's better. Thank goodness for constant sampling and the servers are really nice. I like that they have a to go store front next to the parlor...it makes the grab and go that much quicker if the lines are to be believed around here.

When we drove by, the line looked ridiculous. After finding parking and walking to the store, the line was cut in half. Smooth, the line does move fast, so don't fret.

A long ass line, but worth the wait for the strawberry banana sorbet, and the brown sugar flavors. Tangy and the creamy, and then creamy then tangy.

I effin' love desserts.  I can eat desserts for breakfast, lunch, AND dinner.  Does that sound gross?  Whatevs.  If you were as sweet as me, you'd love desserts this much too.  Jay Kay. IMHO, I prefer the Brown Sugar ("BS") over the Salted Caramel ("SC").  I know SC is all the rave but BS is really the shit.  No bs.  The ginger balances out what could've been overwhelmingly sweet.  But then again, I have no problem with sweets.  As you can tell.  SC on the other hand is saltier than I like my caramel to be.   There are always very long lines, even when SF is at its windiest and coldest.  Thursday night was no exception.  So worth it though.  Of course, as soon as I made my way through the doorway, I snatched a bag of their Toffee Chocolate Chip cookies, which are soooo good.  Not necessary since their single scoop is enough to satisfy any sweet tooth.  Temporarily anyways.

When my friends decided to sell their place a block and a half away from Bi-Rite, it was a good thing I didn't have the $1.5mil to buy it, or else I'd spend every day at Bi-Rite, Delfina, and/or Tartine, and wouldn't be able to fit through the front door.  (Then again, if I had that much money just lying around, I'd also probably be able to afford a personal trainer or lipo. Anyway....) The salted carmel IS really good, but my favorite flavors are ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodle pieces), mint chip, and coffee toffee (Blue Bottle with almond toffee pieces).  The mint chip is super minty and the coffee toffee is super coffee-y, and neither is too sweet (unless you count the toffee bits).  YUM! The chocolate chip toffee cookies are also awesome!  I once bought a bag for myself and one for a friend who I thought I was going to see the next day, but ended up not being able to meet up with her for another couple weeks, so I had to eat her bag of cookies so they wouldn't go bad. Poor, fatty me.

First time I came here on a rare, hot San Francisco day in February and found the line wrapped around the corner! Fast forward to June, I was lucky enough to park a block away. The line was short and I waited less than 20 minutes to try the salted caramel, balsamic strawberry, and ricanelas. Hands down, ricanelas was my favorite flavor! I couldn't get enough! After eating my one scoop, I felt guilty for even getting those other flavors. Overall, I wish they dubbed more snickerdoodle & cinnamon into the ice cream. And that is an understatement. Since I live 100+ away from the creamery, I have to settle for Vanilla bean haagen dazs infused with three tablespoons of ground cinnamon. You're killin me, Bi-Rite.

A little update on more of the flavors I've tried. - Ricanelas - cinnamon with Snickerdoodle, AMAZING and my absolute favorite from this place - Earl Grey - delicious, potent, like Earl Grey punched you in the mouth - chocolate coconut - rich chocolate taste, not much coconut, nothing to write home about, good for the chocolate lover - salted caramel - creamy, rich, caramel had that barely, but almost burnt flavor - brown butter pecan - uber rich, felt fatter just from one taste - honey lavendar - like eating flowers

Have hit up Bi Rite each time on my last 2 Bay area visits. The fist time was before I had given up dairy and I remember ordering the largest brownie sundae available and eating myself into comatose.  It was really really yummy and there was not much of  a line and we easily snagged one of the nifty bench seats around a planter box out front. This visit I was accompanying people who really wanted to try it and some who frequent it often.  I was not excited about watching them eat ice cream and was indifferent to going.  Lo and behold there were a few non dairy options. I had the coconut chocolate which was really good.  Way better than so delicious brand in the store and very good texture and consistency.  I watched everyone else gorge on their sundae's and cones which all looked amazing.   When you develop the gluten/wheat free waffle cone let me know bi rite and I will come a running

The only thing ever upsets me about this place is that there's a line around the corner. But besides that, it's amazing!!!! I love love love the seasonal flavor: Earl Grey. It's amazing. I also love the notorious Salted Caramel, but who doesn't?! Other than the yummies, the staff is always super nice and patient. You technically could probably taste at least 7 flavors before they got mad at you. (I might be exaggerating... I've only tasted 2-3 at a time, but maybe that's because I always pick the right flavors... OR because they're all the right flavors!!) I like this place a lot :)

I think that any flavor that you choose from here won't disappoint but I followed the band wagon and had the Salted Caramel and Lavender Honey as I thought it would be a great combination of sweet and salty (which it was).  I was lucky to go on a Monday before noon and stood in line for only 5-10 minutes.  The cost is about $5 for 2 scoops.

The first thing you will probably notice once you arrive at BiRite is the long line of people waiting to place their order.  If you plan to go on a warm San Francisco day (70 degrees or higher) you'll see this line.  If you go on the weekend you'll see this line.  The line moves pretty fast and even if it didn't the ice cream is worth the wait.  I think BiRite is famously known for their 'Salted Caramel' ice cream which to the ice cream noobie sounds kind of weird.  I'll admit I was skeptical the first time I tried it a few years ago and it even tasted a bit weird the moment it hit my tongue.  After a few more bites I was hooked.  Pure goodness. Today I had their "Ricanelas with bits of Snickerdoodle cookies" which was also delicious! Aside from the salted caramel they offer a number of other interesting flavors as well as mainstream staples like chocolate chip and cookies n' cream.  They've got a small seating area inside with a seating capacity of about 10 people and they have benches just outside the creamery for you to enjoy on a warm day.   If you are not sure what flavors you want, the service staff behind the counter are more than happy to let you try any flavors you want.  Just ask.  If you are really in the mood to indulge, I highly recommend one of their homemade cookies to go along with your ice cream.  I really wish they made fresh cones like Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous in the Dogpatch.  Since they don't I opt for my ice cream in a cup. Highly recommend BiRite.  Great place to take the family (kids and parents) after a meal in San Francisco.

Walked down here from the Castro and Market Street. I went here at 3:30pm, which was not the best idea. My family and I had to wait in line for 20 min. School had just gotten out and their were loads of kids. Overall, ice cream was good and it's an experience to wait in line, worth the wait. Just wish they had more seating.

For people looking to try Bi-Rite for the first time, don't confuse it with the Bi-Rite market down the street! Great service, the people are so nice about letting you try every flavor! Also, I came on a Friday afternoon and there was NO LINE! (even though the Trans March was going on right next door in Dolores Park.) I loved getting to try all the flavors without feeling rushed. I've heard this is great dessert after a meal at Tartine Bakery. The ice cream melted a bit fast for my liking on a moderately sunny day, but otherwise I loved it! The price was also totally acceptable

If you're looking for an imaginative assortment of ice cream flavors with a solid delivery, this is the place. No wonder there was a line circling the block when we first got here! I was craving some mint, so ended up with the mint chip and coffee toffee. IT HIT THE SPOT. Perfect. The coffee was pretty strong, which brought out the sweetness of the toffee even more. The flavors were so organic and fresh! Some other hits among our group were the roasted banana (by far), honey lavender, and salted caramel. Overall, a nice treat on a warm day. And plus, there's a park across the street to lazily sprawl out on and enjoy your ice cream :)

An ice cream shop that has it's own marked line like you're going into a night club means that it's got something special inside. Well Bi-Rite definitely has the recipe. On the edge of Dolores Park it's the perfect place to stop off and cool down. I tried the malted vanilla and the salted caramel. They were both awesome on their own and together as well. The ingredients in each really come through and you can tell that it is high quality ice cream. It is worth the wait, and the line (even if it does take the turn around the corner) doesn't take too long to get through. You definitely will want to take the ice cream to go and walk over to the park or at least walk through the neighborhood. Inside the shop is a bit cramped.

Even though this was my first time here and all I had was a kids cone of Coffee Toffee, I'm willing to rate it pretty high simply because the ice cream was that good. I mean, I've had great ice cream but there were toffee CHUNKS in coffee ice cream... The most annoying thing was the line that wrapped around the corner. I was told that was pretty common so all I can say is... fatties do it right.

This is this BEST ICE CREAM EVER!!!!!!!!! I really never thought ice cream could be this outstanding. They have unique flavors and it's so creamy and full of goodness. We went around 10:40 at night and there was a line but it moved fast and was completely worth it. I had the Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces, and the second scoop (you get 2) was the Ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles).  I want it now.. NOW!!!! try this place, it's soooo gooooooooooood.

Maybe I just came on a day when they didn't have any exciting flavors, but it was just meh. I think I've been spoiled by Sweet Rose Creamery in LA... Bi-Rite's got nothing on Sweet Rose! I got the coffee-toffee and mint chip. It was good, but not really better than Haagen-Dazs or anything.

Bi-Rite's ice cream is by far the best in the city. Their salted caramel flavor is an ice cream miracle. The line may look daunting, but it moves fast. Come here on a sunny day and take your treats to Dolores Park. Their S'mores Pie is also a go-to in my house for birthdays and other festivities - graham cracker crust, gooey caramel, chocolate ice cream and perfectly toasted meringue = heaven! -1 star because their soft serve really doesn't live up to the incredible amazingness that is their regular ice cream. I guess they've raised the bar so high, I expected them to keep it there.

Oh man I don't know where to start!!! Let's just say I frequent SF via a 6 hour drive mainly for the salted caramel and the Sam's sundae...need I say more? Sam's sundae I would say is definitely an acquired taste but nonetheless a unique blend of epic flavors of complimentary sweet and salty oh so good yumminess! Salted caramel is probably the one item that I would recommend as the must try. The scent and flavor of the caramel is so distinct and super delicious I dream about this in my sleep! I've had many so called homemade ice cream that doesn't come close to bi-rite...bi-rite got it right with the unique blend of flavors, texture, and consistency that has made me journey the pilgrimage just to have this! This will be the best ice cream you will ever taste, bar none! It's done...this will go down in my history as one of the best thing I've ever eaten!

GET THE EFF OUT OF MY WAY. my favorite is a "make your own sundae" with malted vanilla, berry compote, and toasted pistachios. your taste buds will never thank you enough. it's incredible. on a related note. wtf on sam's sundae? i get the savory and sweet thing, but too much salt is too much salt. gross. crappy street parking is crappy.

Yum! got the honey lavender and the almond fudge swirl.  the combination was...interesting because the honey lavender overpowered the chocolate but I was more interested in the flavors individually were delicious. I liked the texture of the ice cream too...smooth and creamy. Honey Lavender- smelled like lavender, tasted like lavender.  the texture was good, but nothing especially stood out from other honey lavenders I've had. Almond Fudge Swirl- like what its called, its vanilla ice cream with chocolate swirls and almonds mixed in. Next time I'll be in SF, I want to try more flavors!

I love this place! Honey lavender, salted caramel and toasted coconut are three of my favorites but I have to admit that I haven't tried all of their flavors yet.  Be prepared to wait in a long line before you get to taste these yummy ice creams. The actual store is not that big so good luck on finding a place to sit. Remember to ask for a punch card - I think it's but 10 get 1 free.  They also have the ice creams in pint or quart... so grab one if you want to skip the long line!

Their other flavors of ice cream are pretty good, but they all seem medicore compared to the salted caramel. I always regret it when I get some other flavor along with salted caramel. I wish I just got salted caramel...that's how good it is. The only thing is that the texture changes every time I go! One day it's a perfect consistency to my taste (not too soft, not too firm) and another day it's practically melting. Either way, the deliciousness keeps me coming back for more.

As everyone knows, it's delicious. Of course, if it's even somewhat nice out, I avoid this place as the line gets even crazier than normal. The only real problem is choosing which flavor to get. The salted caramel is actually not my favorite, but I recently tried the basil and it was amazing. I wouldn't have picked it out myself but I'm glad I tried it. Unlike a lot of ice cream connoisseurs (and not surprisingly, since I do not consider myself one), I like soft serve quite a bit, generally more than hard ice cream. But I have to admit their soft serve is fine, but not as good as their hard ice cream. True to my cinnamon-loving nature, I think the rincanelas is the best.

There is not a lot about this place that has not already been said ... I feel like I been all over the city on a quest for good ice cream ... but Bi-Rite keeps me coming back. The line is long at times but if your with a good friend it moves quick. Workers are extremely nice and attentive ... and they give you all the lil spoon samples you can handle .. overall It's always a good experience. BTW the Crème fraiche ice cream they have right now is by far one of the most refreshing things I have ever had ... its great .. try it ... now!!!

On my recent trip to SF, I visited Bi-Rite two days in a row. The first time, I had a single scoop of the white chocolate and raspberry swirl. Heavenly. The second time, I tried the ricanelas -- cinnamon-flavored ice cream with chunks of snickerdoodles. That was absolutely delicious, especially on a sugar cone. Lines weren't too bad the times I went, but I guess I got lucky. I saw lines form pretty quickly after I received my ice cream. My only complaint would be that it is a bit pricey, but I guess the same goes for a lot of ice cream places. I love the inventive ice cream flavors and will definitely come back next time I return to SF.

i've been hearing about good reviews from this place so I thought one of these days, I'll come by and try it out. After late dinner, my friend and I looked for desserts around the area. Yelp told us this place is still open so off we went. there was a long line at 10:30pm (they close at 11). we were lucky to find parking and we waited 10 mins in the line.  luckily it was one of those very few nights in the city when it's not cold to be out. My friend got the vegan choc/coconut and another flavor I can remember. I got brown sugar and strawberry balsamic. First, the ice cream is too sweet, it's a bit gritty...not creamy. the strawberry/balsamic tasted like strawberry jam.. not as I'm expecting it.  Brownsugar was okay. The service was great but the ice cream itself is definitely disappointing. Would rather have Mitchell ice cream...

The ice cream here is great. My cousin and I got here early in the morning to beat the crowd. The salted caramel is good but a bit sweet for me. The honey lavender is tasty too but the lavender is a bit odd for me. I love to smell it, but I don't know about eating it. My favorite was the toasted coconut (I love the texture) and the strawberry balsamic. It sounded very odd at first but it's so yummy. I'd like to try the basil and ginger peach next time. I bought a pint of strawberry balsamic for my bf to taste but for $7.99 a pint, it seemed very steep. I can get a half gallon at Mitchell's for $9 and I honestly like Mitchell's better. The ice cream is creamier there, which I prefer and the prices are more reasonable. Nevertheless, Bi-Rite is a nice treat when my budget and waistline allows for it.

Made my first trip to Bi-Rite yesterday around 5pm, line wrapped around as usual but the wait wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be, considering is was a warm/hot day in the city. Got to the counter in about 15 minutes. Single Scoop for $3.25 (one or two flavors) Malted Vanilla w/ Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate - delicious! not too creamy, loved the slight chewiness from the peanut brittle. great flavor! Chocolate - i love chocolate so of course this was great! I love the idea of passing the menu down throughout the line. Quite an efficient system compared to Mitchell's. I knew what I wanted when I got to the front of the line, which is a plus for me and probably a plus for all the others waiting behind me in line.Also, the line seems to move faster here, and I assume it's because of this menu system. Got lots of love for Mitchell's though. Will be back to try other unique flavors!

OMG.  I finally got to try this place out this past weekend and dude. . . I felt like I died and gone to heaven.  The ever so popular salted caramel lived up to the hype that I've been hearing about this tasty treat.  One of the best tasting ice scream flavors ever. My boyfriend and I walked a long way just to get here on a friday night.  Got there around 10:30PM and it was still super crowded.  I wish we got to try other flavors but we were pretty full from dinner. Next time I'm back in the bay, I'll definitely stop by Bi-Rite and get more salted caramel and try other flavors. YUM!!!!!!!!!!

oh the hype.. not to mention the LINE.. but what's worse is the parking! B -- S -- Good Luck with parking -- Have fun waiting in line -- Prepackaged pints, etc. are available without waiting in line -- Soft serve window = less wait, soft serve, prepackaged ice cream, baked goods and ice cream sandwiches! -- Interesting & unique flavors -- 2 scoops for $4.95, I guess Parking in this area is pretty much nonexistent because of Bi-Rite, Delfina, oh and Dolores Park! 18th and Dolores is basically packed with patrons and cars. I think it took us about 15 minutes to find a spot and that was a lot of circling, etc. Got in line around the corner and took another 15 minutes. I'm not really complaining about it, just letting you know. Fortunately I wasn't in a rush with the GF. We had just came from a lovely dinner at Bacco, so we were full of delicious Italian food and just wanted something sweet. The staff is pretty efficient, it's the customers like me that want to try stuff that make the wait so long lol. It's interesting they use real spoons for the taste testing and those weird wood plank looking spoons when you get your ice cream. Interesting, cheap and effective! Wood is better than plastic I'd assume on the environment. Our Order: -- Double of Salted Caramel & Coffee Toffee: The salted caramel is such a unique and interesting flavor that you keep eating it! I could taste the creamy caramel but the underlying salty taste is always present but not overwhelming. It's such a strange feeling but in a good way and makes sense why people love it so much. The coffee toffee is not for the faint of heart. The coffee is strong like that jungle coffee and the toffee is a crunchy reminder that you're not drinking just a cup of joe. It wasn't mind blowing, but decent. -- Single of Coffee Toffee & Ricanelas: The ricanelas is such an interesting flavor and ice cream. It's very creamy and sugary and the chunks of snickerdoodle put it over the top. I would say that it's probably one of the best flavors out there if you like that kind of thing. Bi-Rite lived up to the hype, but it's NOT necessary for me. I might want to stop by for a pint or an ice cream sandwich but I'm good off waiting 15 mins for a few small scoops. Nevertheless, I'm a fan of this unique and tasty place!

BEST ICE CREAM EVER. My top 3 flavors Salted Caramel: - salty/savory and sweet - has a "cooked" taste to it - like as if you browned caramel on a pan - such a unique flavor you cannot get anywhere else Coffee Toffee: - STRONG flavor - perfect balance of the bitter tinge of espresso, and the sweetness of ice cream - toffee chunks - crunchy and delicious - does not leave a grainy or bitter after-taste Ricanellas: - its reminds me of a snickerdoodle cookie, but in an ice cream form - excellently smooth - nostalgic taste makes you feel happy inside

Good, creamy ice cream.  There may be a line out the door sometimes, but it moves pretty quickly.  There are benches outside for you to enjoy your ice cream, or you could venture over to Dolores Park.  If you're a sun-hater like me, there are tables inside Bi-Rite as well. The Olive Oil flavor may sound disgusting, but it actually tastes surprisingly good.  Try it. My favorite, though, was the Malted Vanilla (with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces) -- SO good. However, it's not amazing enough for me to drive all the way over from Oakland.  Fentons is comparable & so much closer to home.

Tried both the soft serve and the ice cream. Personally, I prefer the soft serve. My favorite part about the experience was the salted caramel (the caramel, not the ice cream) and the brownie they put in the soft serve. The ice cream was good, but not amazing. I prefer my ice cream to be less heavy. It was far too dense for my tastes. The soft serve was better and I thought the balsamic strawberry had a very unique flavor. Pretty delicious. However, this is an ice cream shop. It has a long wait and I was left underwhelmed by the ice cream. The fact that I prefer the caramel and the brownie over the ice cream is a bit of statement in my mind. I'm probably wrong though, I don't know sweets very well.

Oh hell yeah!!! Bi-Rite Creamery is A-mazing. The young lady behind the counter was so friendly and helpful. It was a Thursday morning, about 11am to be exact, and the place was empty, which is a rarity. The friendly lady gave us a million samples...maybe I'm exaggerating a little...maybe it was 6, but that's still a lot considering she didn't have to give us any. All of the flavors that we sampled were delicious, which made it really difficult when trying to decide on which kind to get. Rather than purchasing a pre-made pint, I customized mine. I got a blend of honey lavender and salted caramel. What a fantastic blend of sweet, salty, rich, creamy heaven in a pint! My goodness! Bi-Rite has an array of sizes, from a single scoop, to a half pint, to a pint, to some other larger sizes. I can't remember what they're called. It's about $2 more than a pint of haagen dazs from the grocery store, but you're not going to find these flavors anywhere else (that I'm aware of) so it's worth it. Be warned, that unless you go on a weekday morning, expect to stand in a line out the door and a half mile down the block.

How can I put this delicately to all the big Bi-Rite fans? The ice cream is AIGGGGHHHT. I drove my a$$ across the city to try the much talked about ice cream parlor known as Bi-Rite Creamery. I asked the guy behind the counter which is the most popular flavor here and he told me the salted caramel. I tried my first sample of it and it was disappointing. Maybe because I don't like overly sweeten foods but as a big fan of lavender, I opted for that as my first big cup. Honey Lavender was ...not bad...reminiscent of Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous's smooth quality ice creams.  I don't think it's worth the drive but a great neighborhood pick me up if you're in the area. Another note, they don't do big wedding ice cream cakes in case you're wondering.

Yummy in my tummy. There was a line that wrapped around the outside of the store with about an hour left before closing on a Friday night. The street parking can be a bit tricky but it is well worth the wait. You cannot miss this spot. The line runs so quickly and smoothly (they are really organized and the line moves so quickly). We went on a pretty chilly evening and there were lines at both the creamery and the kiosk right next door. We went in a group and ordered the salted caramel, strawberry balsamic, coffee toffee, toasted coconut, and white chocolate raspberry. All of the flavors were mind blowing. You cannot go wrong with a stop at Bi-rite Creamery.

My bf and I came here last night after we had some Soul Food for dinner. We had to wait in line for a few minutes (15 minutes) but the wait went by fast :) I had no idea that this tiny ice-cream parlor was so popular!! So we finally got inside the place. There was a huge menu displaying all of the ice cream flavors, different kinds of sundaes, etc. All of their sundaes sounded delicious! I settled on a single-serve ice cream cone with two flavors: salted caramel and roasted banana. The salted caramel was divine. I've never tried salted caramel ice cream before and I'm glad I got to try Bi-Rite's! It was light and there was a slight flavor of sea salt, yum. The roasted banana was bananas! SO good! I'm so glad I got that flavor. The flavor wasn't overwhelming and just had the right amount of banana flavor. And there was actual bananas in the ice cream! These two flavors complemented each other VERY nicely and my mouth was in ice-cream heaven. My bf got Brown Sugar and Roasted Banana. He thoroughly enjoyed his ice-cream as well :) We then sat down at one of the tables with some other customers. They weren't that comfortable. Lol :P I noticed that Bi-Rite closes at 10:00 and there was STILL people waiting outside the door! Crazy San Franciscans! The service here is average. Our guy who got our ice cream was wearing a hoodie and had his hood over his head. It was a little unprofessional in my opinion. It's like, I know you're a hipster and all but you're dealing with food products... Be a little more considerate. The other employees seemed to be having fun while working, which is good. The music that was played was a mix of Lady GaGa and other trendy music. This place is small so be prepared to have your order ready so that you won't hold up the line! I can't wait to come back and try their sundaes! Damn, I really wish there was a Bi-Rite Creamery in San Jose... :(

LOVE salted caramel. I could probably eat a whole pint of just this and still want more. I got their salted caramel and balsamic strawberry. The balsamic strawberry pretty much just tastes like strawberry but it's still really good. Ice cream is really smooth and delicious. Wish there was one closer to me.

After much anticipation for Bi-Rite, I finally had the chance this Friday night. The line was luckily NOT out of control and NOT a mile long, and the weather was bearable to withstand whatever line there was. It was clearly meant to be. We ordered a medium size (in which you can choose 3 flavors) to share. The salted caramel (the Yelp favorite!), the malted vanilla with peanut brittle, and chocolate coconut (vegan) were our picks. As usual, Yelpers were right! The salted caramel is most definitely worth ordering!! What a way to reward your taste buds! The malted vanilla was surprising one -- sounded slightly weird, but the sweet and salty flavor once again was a hit! The chocolate coconut was the only one we didn't fully enjoy. The coconut flavor was considerably lacking, and the vegan nature of the ice cream resulted in a slightly more gummy, almost gelato-like consistency. Good experience to taste once, but I'd skip that flavor next time around. I also sampled the honey lavender, because the flavor sounded uber cool. Unfortunately, a little too much floral for me.

I'm not really a big fan of ice cream or sweets in general, but goodness... the stuff they make here at this family-owned & operated little creamery is deliciiouuuussss. I got the mango-coconut-pineapple sorbet and the balsalmic strawberry double scoop in a cone. Definitely one of the better choices I made that day. haha. So good. :) If you come during a hot day, expect to be waiting in a line. It usually goes pretty quickly, especially if not everyone is sampling every flavor they've got. (Although, you can't really blame them.) My friends were joking that if you mixed some of the flavors like the Balsalmic Strawberry and the Basil flavor and the Olive Oil flavor, maybe your ice cream would taste just like a salad. haha. I've got to try that olive oil flavor one day though. p.s. the sweet scents and aromas of cookies and cream will hit you once you walk in. yeah. be prepared to spend monies. haha. (they accept credit cards! sweet!) (my double scoop with a cone cost a little under $5)

Holy molys! Over 4,000 reviews?! Salted caramel - overpowering, way too salty. Honey lavender - way to flowery. And the winner is...roasted banana! -Super-dense consistency -Light & roasty -Just a touch of sweetness -Purrrrfect

YUM^INFINITY! I don't think I could ever get sick of this place. The ice cream is SUBLIMEEEE. It is so rich, flavorful, and creamy. I always get the salted caramel no matter what. The flavor is so happily complex. I definitely didn't know that salt could bring out the best in sweetness until I first came here in college. Bi-rite taught me so much about mixing different flavors I never thought of (balsamic strawberry, brown sugar ginger swirl, sigh...). The line can be ridiculous though. One time, I waited 45 minutes but it was totally worth it. I love how they always have at least 10+ flavors a day and there really is a flavor for anyone. This place is a MUST GO for anyone in SF or anyone who visits SF. Oh, after you get your ice cream, go over to Dolores Park and sit there. And if you're still hungry, go to Tartine Bakery and get a croque monsieur (ask for more pickled veggies!!!).

I am usually more of frozen yogurt person, but this happened to be along the same route to the same place I was volunteering sooo...I decided at [first/last] minute to take a pit stop here. after tasting several/many of their flavors (felt kinda bad---like a cheap [or the more politically correct term: "economical"] chinese like my father would say. but i am indecisive when it comes to almost everything....FINALLY, i decided on a small cup of their salted caramel and coffee toffee...mmm. so good...oh so good. clearly better than the "economical" gallon-sized tubs of cheaply-made ice cream that my college roommates and family [used to] stock up on. Soooo...dont look back and just get it! (if u want ice cream that is...)

I have to admit I was somewhat wary about trying the Salted Caramel. I had just gone to Pinkberry a few weeks before coming here and they offered Salted Caramel froyo... with unfavorable results. But when I finally got a taste of Bi-Rite's --- ice cream heaven. I also had Balsamic Strawberry, which you need not be wary of at all. It has a slightly more savory finish than the conventional strawberry. I also sampled some of my friends' flavors too and they were all delicious. It made me want to line up all over again.

So I found out about Bi-Rite thru my sister about 2 months ago. There was a quart of salty caramel in the freezer and gave it try. I'm not a huge ice cream fan to begin with but after trying the salty caramel ice cream I was hooked. Now every time I drive into the city, I try to make a quick stop at Bi-Rite to stock up on my favorite flavors and race back to the east bay to get all that yummy goodness into the freezer. Last time I was here was this past Sunday, spent $45.60 on ice cream alone. I bought 2 quarts of the salty caramel and a pint of the toasted coconut and Honey Lavender. All worth it and never had to wait in line when purchasing quart and pint sizes. YUM!

Unwilling to stand in the ridiculous line for ice cream, I found the "secret" (or ignored) soft serve line.  BEST soft serve in a land of Dairy Queens!  The best is Salted Caramel and Malted vanilla.  I order cone in a bowl--which gives the eater the best of all worlds. Yes, the regular ice cream is fine.  But the soft serve is divine!

You are not from the bay area if you have never had ice cream at bi rites. There I said it. Since we all know that this place is great, lets talk favorites. I love their pistachio, I usually get the pistachio with crushed almonds and whip on top...just my preference, but I havent seen that flavor for a while (hence I only go here four times a year) but the last time I was here, I tried the honey lavender and it was interesting, it has this floral sweet tastes to it that gets better after every bite you take...I finish the carton of ice cream by myself within two days...man I want more....guess Im going to have to take another trip up to SF soon, writing this review is making me hungry

Ok, I'm probably the only person that isn't completely in love with Bi-Rite, but hear me out. The location is great-- it's right by Dolores Park and is the perfect treat for a warm day. The ice cream flavors range from the usuals like vanilla and chocolate, to more creative flavors like balsamic strawberry. Price-wise, it's what you would expect for a gourmet ice cream shop. While the ice cream is definitely good, I don't think it's anything special. While some of the flavors may seem exotic to some, flavors like balsamic strawberry and salted caramel are pretty standard in these types of gourmet/boutique ice cream places. As someone from Seattle, it reminds me a lot of places like Molly Moon's. I just don't really think it's worth the huge lines that Bi-Rite tends to have. Personally, I much prefer Humphry Slocombe, but maybe that's just me. I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 3 because I know I'm probably just being a snob and everyone else seems to love Bi-Rite. And like I said, it really is a convenient location.

I've come here once and another time avoided the line to instead purchase prepackaged ice cream from the market across the street. The ice cream is truly sublime (I think the salted caramel is a little overbrowned! but when I came back it was mellower.) The honey lavender is delicate and delicious, and the brown butter pecan rich and indulgent. I can make better ice cream at home, but it sure takes a lot of work. Bring a pint home; you'll wish you had if you don't.

My new flavor: Malted Vanilla (which has peanut brittle in it). It taste like a milk shake with heath bar pieces. AMAZING, worth waiting 20 minutes in line...that stretched down the street and around the corner. I decided to be adventurous and I sampled the Basil flavored ice cream, which turns out to be not my cup of tea.

I recently went up to the Bay for a 48-hour Yelp-driven food escapade with Cameron W., and Bi-Rite was the top priority on our list of places to try. I knew before we even started driving over that it would never live up to my insanely high expectations, and I was right. I was not particularly impressed. I prefer Scoops in Los Angeles for reasons that I'll identify in a bit. That said, Bi-Rite is pretty damn good for an ice cream parlour, and I can see why ice cream connoisseurs like it. The trip there was probably one of the most stressful moments of my weekend. We went on a cold, windy, rainy afternoon, and a couple circles around the block were enough to help me grasp the severity of the street parking deficit in the Mission. After about half an hour driving around the area with increasing desperation, we nabbed a spot a few blocks away. By the time we got in line (yes, there was still a line, wtf?) it had started pouring, so we didn't have to wait long. I sampled the blood orange sorbet and some sort of pecan, neither of which was very memorable. The texture was too creamy, and the flavours had no subtlety at all. They were all just mashed together. I ended up getting the honey lavender and the roasted banana per everyone's recommendations. The honey lavender was a little too fragrant for me, but the roasted banana was great. I tried the salted caramel too, which was more of a miss than a hit for me. It had a nice touch of smokiness to it, but there was just too much going on for me to really enjoy it. I'm definitely more of a gelato person -- I prefer Scoops' lighter, subtle flavours to Bi-Rite's more heavy-handed approach.

One of the best and most unique scoop shops I've ever been to. With unique flavors like Ricanelas (snickerdoodle), lavender, and my favorite, Salted Caramel, this place is a favorite destination of mine. The line can get pretty long, especially on sunny days, but it is definitely worth the wait. The soft serve shop next door, on the other hand, is not.

Thank you, 7x7 for putting Bi-Rite on your list! Now I understand why everybody adores this place! I'm definitely a fan, BUT not that ridiculous line. I cheat and instead of waiting, bf drops me off while he circles around the block, I go in the smaller store, aka the 'to-go' section and buy the ice cream in pints. It took literally, 2 minutes to stand in line and order my delectable ice cream. Genius. I'd rather pay a little more for pints of ice cream than stand in that awful line. I love the Salted Caramel and Roasted Banana flavor! I can't wait to try the Honey Lavender!

3 1/2 stars?  I still think Mitchells has a creamier texture and all around richness to it.  I think for a "fancy" ice creamery this is the best I've been to, so I'll give them credit for that.  I tried the salted caramel and the ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodle pieces).  The salted caramel was good at first, and then it just tasted more and more like burnt sugar.  Sure, that's what caramel is...but this just had a slight bitterness that I couldn't take.  The Ricanelas was pretty good though, so if I were to ever go back, I'll probably get that again.  The boyfriend got vanilla and mint chip.  The vanilla was bland, not as vanillay as others I've tasted (or made at home), but the mint chip was pretty good. I don't think I'd stand in that outrageous line that they usually have since I think it's not worth it and a little overrated, but if the line is short, I'll gladly stop by...but yeah, not worth the wait for me.  The boyfriend, who is a huge ice cream lover wasn't impressed either.

Still love this place! I got the salted caramel and strawberry balsamic flavored ice creams. I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE Bi-Rite's ice cream flavors. The ice cream itself is rich and creamy and definitely super flavorful. There was no line when we came in and parking was really easy to find. Another plus, I just discovered that Tartine is just right on the corner! SCORE. As someone who doesn't live in the city, I thought this discovery was life-changing.

Went to Bi-Rite Creamery a few weeks ago after hearing about it from several people. It had been a hot day so it was perfect to try it out. Got there and found a queue of about 20 people or so. The hype on the streets translated when I saw the place with my own eyes. Upon seeing the menu, I was delighted to see my favorite flavor of all time, Salted Caramel on the menu. I went ahead and ordered that. The ice cream has a really unique, rich taste to it. Its unlike anything I've tried, really. With all the different varieties, I'd like to try and sample other flavors next time I visit.

The vegan chocolate is good, but you don't come here for that. You come here for the amazing ice cream and sauces and cookies and sundaes and everything else. AND THEY HAVE THE BEST NATURAL SPRINKLES EVER! The lines are long but the ice cream is worth the hassle. Try their brownies as a topping, or better yet... buy an entire pack of brownies and make an ice cream sandwich! One brownie, TONS OF ICE CREAM, and another brownie!

Came here for the first time on Labor Day and the line was around the corner of the building, but it went by pretty fast and not long after we were inside! After trying out a few flavors, I went with a single (1-2 flavors) of white chocolate raspberry & salted caramel. Delicious! And perfect on a sunny day to enjoy at Dolores Park. I didn't care too much for the brown sugar with ginger caramel syrup because the ginger seemed to overpower the ice cream, but I was satisfied with my choice of flavors. Must try!

the last time we were in SF, we attempted to go to bi rite but were discouraged by the long line wrapped around the block. this time we were determined to go early. on our mission to hit as many spots before our flight home, we went to bi rite right when it opened. there was no one there and the only thing that took long was deciding what we wanted to get! the salted caramel was good. you could taste the saltiness and it wasnt too overpoweringly sweet. the coffee toffee was also pretty good. it tasted like a good coffee ice cream with chunks of crunchy toffee in it. the early grey was also pretty good and tasted just like a cup of earl grey tea! you can get it in a cup or cone and one or two flavors. you can also get their pints which are also sold across the street at the bi rite market. service is friendly and efficient. i was definitely happy after finally going to bi rite. its a definite must-go-to place while in SF.

Yummy Orangey Salty Chocolate Balls of Icecream! I'm talking about the Sam's Sundae, which is two scoops of rich chocolate icecream, drizzled with bergamot olive oil and sprinkled with malden sea salt, with a side of heavenly whipped cream!!! Featured on the food network and recently raved about by my fellow sweets indulger Ciara G, i knew exactly what i was gonna order while heading up to SF. And luckily, there was no line around lunch time! (although i did see a line around the block the night before). The first thing i did was to satisfy my curiosity of salted caramel (never had before!) with a sample of their icecream version. It was delicious but i couldn't see myself eating a whole cup full of it. I also sampled the honey lavender -nice but it was too perfumy for my taste. So i stuck to my pink guns and stayed with my original choice of the Sams Sundae!!! The combination sounds strange, but it does all work together into this really interesting swirl of flavors. There's a citrus-y tang from the olive oil that really compliments the chocolate oh so well. The salt on the other hand- you either like or not. Although i love salt, i'm not a huge fan of Sea salt, so i could have done without it. But the dude enjoyed it. Next time i want to try their Balsamic Strawberry and get a couple of their cupcakes! Eat it with the wooden spoon- tastes better for some reason!

They also rotate a nice array of innovative and ultra-fresh classic flavors - all organic, all good, except one.

Back in April: I spent $4.75 on a double scoop of Balsamic Strawberry on a sugar cone. (That was so good and I was impressed, but I'm not coming back again.) Two weeks later: I took my daughter after her Dr. appt. I spent $4.75 on a double scoop of Ritual Toffee Coffee in a cup. She had the $3.25 kid scoop of Cherry Almond on a sugar cone. (That was so yummy; we are not coming back again.) A month later: I took my niece after lunch. I spent $4.75 on a double scoop of a Salted Caramel. She had the Cookie and Cream and Vanilla combo. (The third trip was better. But then, we won't ever come back.) Few weeks later: The Fantastic-4 came here after an early dinner. I spent $4.75 on a double scoop of Cookie and Cream and Cherry Almond combo. Wife had the double scoop of Honey Lavender. Jr. had Toffee Vanilla and daughter had Salted Caramel. (The fourth visit for the "Fantastic-4"; nah, we better not.) Last week: The Fantastic-4 and niece came after an event nearby. I spent $4.75 on a double scoop of Honey Lavender and Vanilla. Wife had the Ritual Coffee Toffee and Mexican Chocolate combo. Niece had the Salted Caramel and Mint Chip. Daughter had a scoop of Balsamic Strawberry Jr. had the Toasted Coconut. ("Forget it!

There's the infamous salted caramel. The note posted on the refrigerator says the salted caramel is not as hard when frozen but stays creamier/more melty because of the higher sugar content? Great, now I don't think I want to order that again. Honey lavender. Soap anyone? Roasted banana. If you are crazy about bananas. Brown butter pecan. I do like the nuttiness. Sam's Sundae. Chocolate ice cream with bergamot olive oil, maldon sea salt and whipped cream. The best thing I ever ate?

Bi-Rite is an ice-cream power-house. Bi Rite is worth a block and a half line and could even be worth three. Their stuff is insane. Never had I had such rich, sharp, and distinct flavor in such perfectly made ice-cream. The salted caramel IS - buttery, creamy salted caramel. The honey lavender IS -sweet lightly fragranced cream. The banana ice-cream IS -rich-creamy fresh bananas. The ginger is lovely and cuts your tongue with precise flavor. None of that half-assed..."eh it tastes like a little like strawberries....yeah like strawberry flavored milk....kinda" stuff. Bi-Rite brings it. Leaving nothing but a trail of pure tongue lolling bliss. .... Oh and...I'm still not done yet.. YES there is more. Their sundaes have fresh whipped cream. Yes fresh. They make homemade popsicles, and homemade toppings. And their servers, even with the line quickly growing behind you, will walk you through their flavors and reassure you that you've chosen well. Jann's in Elementary School never tasted this good Haagen Daags (sp) in Middle school...ehhhhhh not quite. Gelato in Italy in high school might dance kinda close up on Bi-Rite. But international area codes don't apply to this competition. And even the thick Baskin and Robbins shakes from College didn't and don't match this stuff. They bow down at Bi-Rite's beautiful organic sugar cone. Cause Bi-Rite keeps the good stuff coming. They keep their flavors exciting. Their sundaes creative... Bi-Rite is genius and everything good. Vote Bi-Rite and you'll be lickingsugardrizzledfingers for days.

They advertise "artisanal ice cream, sorbets and confections", which I believe is a hoity-toity way of saying they're charging a few more shekels for your scoops, sport. That's fine by me because...dare I say it...it may very well be as good as Mitchell's (a clap of thunder erupts the near-silence of my typing). A friend of mine with more refined taste than me recommended I come here. So of course, I pick a brutally cold evening to visit, and there's still a line. Lots of flavors to choose from, and a very friendly staff to serve you. I decide to get creative and ask for a combination of the coffee-toffee and ginger in a single scoop. They comply, and to add insult to injury, I ask for toffee bits to be sprinkled on top. The combination is frickin' good...a total moo-cow high. A single scoop is $2.95, and a topping is 75-cents more, so $3.70 is not a discount, but it isn't a piggy bank-breaker either. They even have little benches in front to allow you complete concentration as you lick. they have cakes and some goodies in a display on the side, but go for the ice cream. One area for improvement - put the names of the ice cream flavors in a prominent display on a sign that we could see as we wait. I noticed only later that they scribbled the flavors on the glass next to the front door. ICE CREAM - 5 stars...dare I say it...it's Mitchell's-level...now I have to be killed AMBIANCE - 4 stars...cute, compact space with a retro-sign across from the  bustling market and catty-corner from Dolores Park SERVICE - 4.5 stars...service with a smile TOTAL - 5 stars...lactose addicts unite!

Did you know its possible to hypnotize a chicken? I learned this useful little trick during my childhood summers spent on a farm. If you don't believe me, check out this video: http://www.youtube.com/w… So what does this have to do with BiRite? Well, the first time I tried Bi-Rite I correctly presumed I should sit down to fully enjoy what was coming. About three bites in I looked, and felt, like that hypnotized chicken. I sat there in a trance- motionless (except for the continuous scooping) gazing off into space completely unaware of anything besides that blissful sensation in my mouth. When I finished and came back to consciousness, I turned to my date and said, "Right now- I can die happy. Honestly, there's just nothing else after this ice cream." *SIGH*

If you pop pills (Lactaid to be more specific), or have a steady  supply of Gas-X plus a box of  Imodium (just in case), then you know you are a Lacto-like me! Why-Oh-Why would a foodie since birth be born Lactose Intolerant?!  Such travesty!!! Do you know how much of a torture it is to be the only person at the table to not be able to eat that decadent creme brulee and opt for a boring sorbet instead?! Well, Lactos rejoice!!! With Bi-Rite's VEGAN BANANA ICE CREAM   (Don't say, "No, you di-n't!" ) Because I did-- one kid's cup of Vegan Banana Ice Cream for $2.25 and it was delicious!!!!  I was salivating over SALTED CARAMEL, HONEY LAVENDER,  BROWN SUGAR, and all those decadent flavors but I just couldn't. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Vegan Banana, however, made up for my longing for regular ice cream.  It was smooth, slimy like  ripe bananas, so full of bananas you can even see the seeds -- just plain wonderful that if all vegan ice creams taste like this, I wouldn't be so bitter about being born Lacto. I did not  even miss the cow. (They also have Vegan Chococate Ice Cream.) So, Lactos, Vegans, and non Lactos alike, go to Bi-Rite. I guarantee you'll find your flavor. BTW, who says I have self-control? I asked for a sample of the FAMOUS SALTED CARAMEL.  (Some things are just worth-suffering for.) For that flavor alone, I'll pop a truck load of Lactaid for one delicious scoop of Bi Rite Ice Cream! Go now and sample every flavor at this tiny ice cream shop. The staff are very nice and will let you.   Grab your ice cream and chill at Dolores Park across the street! http://en.wikipedia.org/…

Honestly, with all the hype, don't come here expecting the ice cream to change your life... because really, it is still just ice cream.  What this place is great for is that it offers unique flavors.  Some interesting flavors I remember are: - Malted vanilla ice cream with peanut brittle and chocolate - Cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodle - Salted caramel ice cream - Brown sugar ice cream with ginger caramel swirl - Coffee toffee I sampled 4 flavors, but I just had to order their salted caramel after all the reviews.  It was really delicious, but the flavor became too strong after having more of it.  I got the cinnamon with snickerdoodle for the man after sampling it because I thought it was quite tasty too.  It's like cookies and cream, but with snickerdoodle instead of oreoes! The texture of their ice cream was thick, and creamy.  Overall very delicious!  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I can't wait to go back to try more flavors! A few notes...  They have regular flavors, and they have seasonal flavors, so don't always expect your favorite to be there!  Also there are two Bi-Rites, across the street from each other.  One appears to be a large market, which closes earlier than the other.  The other is a tiny little storefront that only serves their ice cream products.  Bonus points for being open late enough for me to have ice cream after a late dinner!

I wanted to check off another item on the 7x7, so I walked over to Bi-Rite after stuffing myself at brunch.  I was expecting a super long line, but it actually wasn't that bad.   Vincent K. and I just shared a scoop of the salted caramel and the coffee toffee.  After the first bite of the salted caramel....OMG...the best ice cream I've ever tasted.  And then the coffee toffee...YUMMMM.  Bi-Rite is sooooooo much better than anything you can buy in the grocery store.   A few weeks later, we came back and bought the pint sizes of the salted caramel, coffee toffee and toasted coconut.  Piggy Patra in full effect!

I've been hearing about Bi-Rite Creamery for the last 3 years. Finally, I got the chance to partake in the glory that is, what most say, is the best ice cream in SF. I think the two things that surprised me most about this place was how small and almost hole in the wall it is and how friendly the staff is. We were in here at about 8pm on a Sunday night, amidst a long line of anxious customers and the ladies scoopin' the goods up front were all smiles and very polite. They let you sample to your heart's content, but my advice to you: if the line is long, don't try more than a few flavors at the most before you pick your poison. Bi-Rite customers DO NOT want to wait a long time for their Salted Caramel or Mint Chippy... or the Roasted Banana Ice cream. And why should we? The stuff is delicious. I tried the vanilla with caramel, (something else) and ginger and it was SO good. If I could consume more than a spoonful of real ice cream without getting sick, I would have had this. Instead, I went with their chocolate soy variety. It was delicious and tasted more like iced chocolate frosting a soy something. I will happily come back here each and every time I'm in SF... duh.

There's nothing I can say that 2800+ people haven't said about this place except that Bi Rite has introduced me to my all time favorite flavor of ice cream - Salted Caramel. And it has a very incredible after effect. Case in point: My breath smells like garlic and onions after eating a delicious pizza from Delfina across the street. However, one taste of this carefully prepared ethereal treat http://media1.px.yelpcdn… has me singing the praises of the slightly burnt, buttery, wonder http://media1.px.yelpcdn… . After a single spoonful has been swallowed, magically my breath smells like cotton candy and children's laughter. Go figure. P.S. Try Bi Rite before 3pm on a weekday or in the AM on a foggy weekend and you won't have to wait in line too long.

Definitely love braving the lines to this place. I mean, it moves, and by the time you get in the door you have some idea of what you want right? Perhaps, but a taste of something here or there will likely change your mind. My recent favorite? Brown Butter Pecan and Roasted Banana. The Ricanelas I tasted was amazing too... but I didnt get enough scoops to want it as a third flavor... yet it's highly recommended. They also sell caramel and other jarred goods made by them that go beautifully with their ice cream (or, if you must, someone elses). Tip: if it's your first time, and you're in line, ask almost someone on either side of you; chances are one of them has been there before and has a recommendation.

I'd been slacking on giving Bi-Rite word time as one look at the 895+ reviews on the Yelp page, and the endless serpentine line out the door and it's pretty apparent that people do indeed love this place. So this one's for my east coast brethren who ask me where to go when in the Yay Area. HEEEEEEEEREEEEEEEE, friends. We're talking local Strauss rGbh free milk churned to the paragon of ice cream existence! Merely the sight of it gives me palpitations. Gripping one of their old skool wooden spoons digging into a biodegradable cup of salted caramel, coffee toffee or balsamic strawberry sweetness cures any psychological ailment for the duration of consumption guaranteed, says Dr. Ligaya. Oooh lucky San Francisco. How rare for the hippie, foodie and hedonist to all be satisfied at once!

We ordered pizzas for take-out at Pizzeria Delfina across the street, and we had 20 minutes to kill. I noticed Bi-Rite, and after reading all the hype on Yelp, I had to see what all the fuss was about. Since I'm a huge chocolate freak, initially I was a little disappointed to see only two chocolate flavors (and one was vegan chocolate coconut) on the menu. After trying the chocolate, all was forgiven. Then scooper guy was really friendly and offered us samples of anything, and didn't rush us at all, despite the line. I tried a few other flavors and setlled on chocolate (of course) and salted caramel. My husband ordered some sort of cinnamon snickerdoodle flavor and our son takes after mommy - CHOCOLATE! Smart boy. It was excellent and reminiscent of gelato. It may be the best ice cream I've ever tasted.

OHM OHM OHM The ice cream here is pretty damn good! *thumbs up* Bi-Rite is a unique creamery in that they have exotic flavors that aren't typically found in ice cream such as Honey Lavender, Salted Caramel, and Roasted Banana; they make almost everything at the creamery, and a lot of their ingredients are organic. Upon entering, we were able to sample as many flavors as we wanted. Although the server looked a little frustrated that we all wanted to try something, he reluctantly but kindly granted us the privilege to try a whole bunch. I tried Coffee Toffee and my friend's sample of Salted Caramel and found that while the latter was a little too sweet, the Coffee Toffee was pretty good. I bought a pint of Coffee Toffee to bring home and although it was a little pricey at $7.99, my family and I enjoyed it. My friends got single scoops which were a little pricey ($3.25) for the size, but from what I tried they were good too. *SIDE NOTE*: If you see Bi-Rite Market down the block DON'T get confused and ask for ice cream there. It's the wrong place. While we didn't make this mistake, we almost did since both Bi-Rite's are only a couple paces away from each other!

I get really bad ice-cream headaches.  Like, so bad that I double-over in pain, can't talk, and suffer for minutes at a time.   Here's what happens when I go to Bi-Rite: Me: "Ooh.. Chocolate Peanut Butter.. Single scoop in a cup, please." *I walk outside and eagerly dig into my ice-cream.  Three huge spoonfuls and I'm in heaven.  UNTIL...* Me: "Owwwww.  Owweeeee.  My head.... Owwww!" *I bend over in pain next to Dolores Park.  To passersby I appear out of breath, but that is not the case.  I am just in a whole heck of a lot of pain.  Then I recover.  And eat two spoonfuls* Me: "Owwww..  Oh. my. gosh... Ouch!  For the love of all that is good and holy! What's wrong with me?  I'm dyyyyinnnnnggg.  Owwww." *Bend back over. A position, thanks to Bi-Rite, I am now familiar with.  Hah. ;o) Pattern continues until all the ice cream is gone* Bi-Rite has turned me into a masochist.  The ice cream is the huge bearded guy in leather with a mask and whip, I'm bent over in public, and the pain is honestly worth it.

What do you want me to say? It sucked? I hated it? Should I even bother writing a review? I guess... You already know it's 5 stars. I thought I had amazing 5 star ice cream before in my life, that was until i had Bi-Rite. I tried the Salty Carmel, Cookies N' Cream, the Coffee Toffee and the Snickerdoodle flavors... All of them were outstanding. The shop is located at a kiddie corner across from Delores Park. The shop is pretty small inside, with only 3 seats against a wall. You can sit outside near the trees and people watch, which is nice in this part of town... The price must fluctuate from time to time because the prices in the Yelp pictures are lower than what I paid today... If you're looking for the best of San Francisco, best of Yelp, best of Ice Cream in your life... You've gotta try Bi-Rite.

This is not frozen yogurt, you SoCal-wannabe, faux-health-food-eating, spandex-while-jogging-with-your-baby-stroller-­wearing, froyo-eating weirdos.  This is ICE CREAM.  The real deal.  Best g'damn ice cream since the last ice cream I made myself at home.  I am not messing around - this ice cream is ridiculously good.  At $4.50 a pint it's hardly any more expensive than Haagen Fruzen Daazle Shizzle Wizzle - but WAY WAY WAY better.

When the weather turns warm I immediately think of ice cream. OK, let's be honest, I'm obsessed with ice cream and I'll pretty much eat ice cream in a flood, snowstorm, monsoon, well, you get it. At least when it's warm I have a legitimate reason to eat ice cream. So we headed to Bi-Rite Creamery. Apparently, I'm not the only one who likes ice cream on warm days as there was a line out the door and halfway to the corner. "I hope this shit is worth it and not just some trendy shit that I'll be paying through the nose for just to say 'I tried Bi-Rite Creamery,'" I thought to myself. The plan was to get a scoop with the wife as an afternoon treat then go home and cook a little dinner later. I'm a chef. I don't cook for myself very often and this was a big deal. (If you were a garbage man would you take out the garbage at home? I didn't think so, smart guy.) As I neared the counter and got a better glimpse of the flavors my order soon changed to a full on sundae complete with berry compote, whipped cream and crumbled pieces of biscotti. Dinner is SERVED! The ice cream is made with Strauss Creamery milk and they have classic flavors like vanilla and mint chip as well as some creative twists and fresh flavors like roasted banana, salted caramel and brown butter pecan. The Kid has a little congestion so I got the soy chocolate so I could share with her. What kind of heartless motherfucker eats ice cream around a kid and doesn't share? The soy chocolate is amazing and almost completely convincing as real ice cream. Which brings me to another point. There are soy options as well as sorbets for the vegans or lactose intolerant (I will not STAND for lactose! Poor bastards.) It's all high quality and really delicious (and this is from a dude who eats enough ice cream to know) so what are you waiting for? It's ice cream time, dude!

I know every kid growing up has always wanted to eat ice cream for breakfast, except for me!   Yesterday however, since I wanted to beat any possible line for Bi-Rite and have been craving sweets so bad, bf & I had ice cream for breakfast right when they opened!  They guy helping us was really nice and gave us a few samples with big spoons, no typical sample spoons here! I got the single size cup ($3.25) with a scoop of Ricanelas & their ever so popular Salted Caramel.  He made his own Sundae ($6.50) with Cookies N Cream with fudge & brownie toppings.  The Ricanelas was good the cinnamon and snicker doodle flavor was a little subtle.  The Salted Caramel we loved!  Caramel can usually be too sweet but the salt was the perfect balance for it.  I even bought a pint to go!  I usually don't go for sundaes, but his was yummy, their brownie pieces are so good!  I've also tried their Roasted Banana Ice Cream at Osteria Coppa and loved it's creamy consistency and full on banana flavor.   We got lucky with parking a block up after a few circles around, but we all know how difficult parking can be here, so thank goodness I bought my emergency pint of Salted Caramel, when that runs out I'll definitely be back!

I LOVE the blood orange sorbert. It's kind of an acquired taste since it's really orange-y/grapefruit-y and tangy, but I love it and it's really fruity and refreshing!

When we got here there was zero line, but later we saw it going down the block, I guess it varies.

And here it is. I am commemorating my 1000th review on Yelp with one of the most Yelp'd places I've ever been to. I thought long and hard about what I should do with my 1000th, after all its no small feat and I'm sure my carpel tunnel will thank me later but after all, this is what Yelp is all about. Bi-Rite Creamery is just the appropriate venue for me to celebrate this 1000th review (and hopefully more to come) as it is the definition of what happens when people get together and share their opinions and love for food with the world. It results in a good 20 minute line around the block for this little creamery that serves up not 5, not 10 but more than 15 tantalizing flavors of ice cream from a variety of sorbet (vegan) options to real oreo cookie crumbs in my cookies and creme. The staff is beyond friendly, and very dedicated to the creamery as they immediately attack you with free samples if you so ever slightly mention the word "ice" or "citrus" until you're just about full from trying all the flavors. Then you have to make the deathly difficult decision as to what you'd like. Yes the double can only hold 3 flavors, THREE that's it! Stop getting so greedy and move on. And no, I would not recommend anymore than three flavors unless you really enjoy a good ol' case of stomach aches later, like your mama warned ya! The inside of this shop is very small and almost no one really stays to sit in its two small tables to enjoy the ice cream especially since there are nice benches outside on a great weathered evening in San Francisco (and these are rare indeed). They do sell pints and cakes to go so if you want those you can just walk directly up to the cashier. For the authentic experience I recommend you wait in line anyway, get some scoops and then get a pint to go; after all the line is what makes it even more special! You can also call ahead to order and customize a party-sized ice cream treat any way you want it. Finally, they have a bakery portion on the side that serves soft serve ice cream in salted caramel and two other flavors that you can swirl. The cupcakes and pastries are ... ok ... If I had to give them a separate rating it would probably have to be 2.5 stars (sorry, it really did not impress) but the ice cream was incredible. Cookies and creme: best I've ever had (and of course my absolute favorite in terms of ice cream flavors ...) Honey Lavender: where do they come up with these flavors?! Vegan Chocolate: I don't even like chocolate and this was finger lickin' good Kiwi Banana Sorbet: refreshing and does not leave a sticky feeling in your mouth Pineapple Mango Sorbet: also very similar, but I did like the kiwi banana better Brown sugar Ginger Caramel: to. die. for. and again, I hate ginger. they're really getting me to eat all my veggies so to speak :) I will have to stop by for a pint, or two ... or three next time I'm in the area. maybe four.

Quick update: I went there this afternoon and had a double-scoop in a cup; the Ricanelas and the Creme-Fraiche. I had already spoken about the Creme-Fraiche before, but the Ricanelas was BLOODY AMAZING !!!! I don't know how to describe it but the cinnamony-spicy flavour was perfect and I couldn't recommend it enough! ====================== Having had a bite at Ike's our group strolled over to this other San Francisco foodie-landmark. I must admit I had heard about Bi-Rite in passing and never really paid it much attention. So here I was, with absolutely no expectations. I took the mini "single" cup with a small scoop of creme fraiche and another of the toasted coconut. I particularly liked the mild subtle flavours of the creme fraiche and loved the texture that bordered on a soft serve ice cream --- just the way I like it! The toasted coconut too was really good with bits of toasted coconut blended in, but I'd rather take the coconut gelato I had in Berkeley over this one. And oh, I am definitely coming back for more ... but not before I drop in at Humphry Slocombe (haven't been there either) first.

Oh, Bi-Rite!  Why, oh why, have I been neglecting you for so long?? As I finally got myself to peel away from the usual post-dinner froyo treat, I returned to Bi-Rite to satisfy my salted caramel fix.  And satisfy, it did.  If you don't love Bi-Rite's salted caramel, you're not my friend. To add to my salted caramel scoop, I added a scoop each of cookies and cream and malted vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate chips.  Cookies and cream was good, but malted vanilla was grrrrreeeat!   My favorite drink as a kid was iced Horlicks (http://farm4.static.flic…).  My favorite candy for a while was Horlicks Malties (http://farm3.static.flic…).  Case in point: I love Horlicks.  And Bi-Rite's malted vanilla brought me back -- waaay back -- to my childhood.  Loved the bits of peanut brittle and chocolate chips too. Bi-Rite, now that the weather is getting warmer, you'll be seeing more of me.  I promise.

The first time I was here, it was a hot Saturday afternoon and there was line out the door that almost reached the corner.  But I waited in line patiently underneath the scorching sun. And you know what happened on my inaugural visit?  I was asked to leave the premises. I didn't mean to to destroy their display of books and stuff.  But I thought there was a clue hidden in one of the fixtures. How was I suppose to know they weren't participating in the Yelp Scavenger Hunt 2008? And in my defense, when asked for a clue, they were the ones who pointed me to the display in the first place. I made a promise to return and try their famous ice cream and see what all the hype was about. I finally got to experience it. And to the chagrin of many family, friends, and fellow yelpers, I didn't like it. The Roasted Banana was too sweet. The overall flavor wasn't bad and the texture was creamy enough, but there was this sugary aftertaste with almost each bite. It's too bad since I like do enjoy banana ice cream. I wonder. With so many positive Yelp reviews, could I be the one who's wrong? I'll give this place yet another chance. Beware Bi-Rite, I'll be back. And when I ask for a clue, you better not point to the bookshelf. Oh, and that ice cream of yours better impress since I rarely give a second chance.

I was struck with a Bi-Rite ice cream craving (not a fro-yo craving, wow).  This time my experience wasn't quite as good as the first time but with the gourmet toppings, fresh baked goods (cookies, brownies, mini chocolate souffles), boxes of sprinkles, ice cream books and natural tasting, high quality ice cream, it still merits five stars. I tried the cinnamon ice cream with bits of crushed snickerdoodle cookies (the name of the ice cream starts with "r").  I love cinnamon and snickerdoodles - inspired combination with plenty of cinnamon. The orange cardamom ice cream tasted natural and had bits of orange rind but the cardamom flavor wasn't there.  This one was a miss for me because I am a cardamom fan.   I sampled the ginger ice cream - nice and zingy with ample fresh ginger.   The biggest disappointment was their chocolate chip toffee cookie.  It was almost paper thin.  That type of cookie should never be that thin.  I'm sure it would have tasted great crumbled up in ice cream but on it's own, it was a big miss.

I did not win the genetic lottery.  There was no big winner on 10/3/1980. A blonde, blue eyed baby with no eyebrows, I was born with the genetic makeup for broad shoulders, little to no ass, toothpick legs and an affinity for ice cream.  Ok, affinity is the mildest word I could possibly use.  It's an obsession; a love affair so hideously painful that if I ever become lactose intolerant (I am knocking on wood as I type), I will do a flying cartwheel off the GG. Ice cream is the purest form of sensuality, don't you think?  Creamy, sinful, satisfying.  Roasted Banana and Salted Caramel Ice Creams topped w/ Chocolate Sauce.  Did you just climax from that description?   No?  Well, I did. You see, Bi-Rite Creamery does things to me you'll never be able to do... even if you are tremendously flexible and use both hands.

In 19 days, my boyfriend will be back from his adventure in Australia. In 19 days, my heart will explode. In 19 days, his poor stomach is going to be inundated with cheeseburgers and burritos and bacon and all of the things that Oz just doesn't seem to know how to make properly. And when he's finally finished stuffing his face, I'm gonna make sure he satisfies his sweet tooth with some real ol' American ice cream at Bi-Rite Creamery, because the land down under sure as hell doesn't know what it's doing in that department. (And don't even get me started on their shoddy excuses for milkshakes.) Brown sugar and ginger caramel. Ricanelas. Salted caramel. Even the classics like mint chip and vanilla. He's going to eat it all and love it. Because after seven and a half months of crappy ice cream in Australia, he deserves nothing but the best in San Francisco.

It was raining yesterday and i dunno what it is about rain and ice-cream, but supposedly the two don't mix.  well, it does if you walk by Bi-Rite and see only two people at the stand!!!! Like you all know...on any other day..the line is like 20 deep.  Not today.  And i was finally about to discover what all the hype was about.  My compadre recommended the salted caramel, which didn't immediately make me tinkle--when the parlor dood saw my lack of interest, he put a big ole scoop in a spoon and passed it to me. ... Like 45 minutes later, i realized i have been spitting out all of these deep, dark secrets that i hadn't planned on sharing with my friend.  have i been bamboozled??   I suppose it makes sense for the KGB to open up a truth serum shop masked as an ice cream parlor here in SF.  But, my issue is why the heck haven't they opened shop in the Rich dammit?!?! hmm...peoples heed with caution on your way to this place and if you notice your company not really eating the ice cream..just shut your mouth for the rest of the night as you might find yourself in the predicament i was in. umm.  yes.  best ice-cream i have ever had in this life and all of my prior lives.

I got a kid's scoop of the soy chocolate and it was tasty. Not as creamy as regular ice cream but good nonetheles.  Then, I tried a bite of Mimi's salted caramel.  I would've cursed the gods, if I believed in them, for making me lactose intolerant.  It was so delicious, sweet and salty like a See's caramel lollipop and I used to love those things as a kid. Next time I will get a popsicle and not taste anyone else's stuff.  I don't need to know what I'm missing out on.

I think I hit the jackpot on my first attempt at Bi-Rite, because I think I got the batch with crack in it.  Seriously...the ice cream is that addicting.   I had the opportunity to try Brown Sugar, Salted Caramel, and Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Chocolate.  WOW!  The Brown Sugar ice cream comes with a ginger caramel swirl.  Almost tasted like I was eating a sugar cookie...in ice cream form.  The salted caramel was my absolute favorite.  If I could think of something it most resembles it would be a See's Candy Butterscotch lollipops.  The Vanilla ice cream with peanut brittle and chocolate pieces was very good as well.  I recommend this if you are a big peanut brittle fan.  The vanilla flavor kind of gets masked by the peanut brittle flavor.   Bi-Rite lives up to the hype and more.  Interestingly enough, the packaged ice cream will not give you nutrition facts...but you shouldn't be worried about it because it's ORGANIC!  So that in itself bypasses all the calories!  Enjoy!

I had great ice cream, I had amazing gelatto (in Italy), and this place can definitely keep up. The lines can get really long but worth the wait. There are two lines, one (shorter usually) for soft serves/bake goods and the other for the ice cream. Also, across the street, there is the grocery store. My favorites: honey lavender, roasted banana, and brown sugar. The salted carmel is good, but can get pretty heavy.

What do you do when it's hot as the devil's ass crack in the city, and you just had an absolutely amazing meal, but the restaurant didn't have any desserts that called out to you? Given that I'm writing this review, those who have not suffered severe head trauma would naturally conclude the answer is: go to Bi-Rite Creamery. I had the brownie sundae (because I'm a sucker for those), but swapped the vanilla ice cream for lavender honey.  Wifey had a double-scope cone of roasted banana. We took our just desserts and found a nice slice of bench near a tree in front of Bi-Rite, and sat and watched the sun fade from the western sky, as the houses on the hill glowed from inside out, and people on the tennis courts near the park lazily lobbed balls back and forth under the lights.  I savored my sundae, the ice cream perfectly recreating the flavor of lavender honey.  Wifey devoured her cone, which tasted just exactly like Bananas Foster.  We sat in front of the brightly-lit Creamery, and we talked for a long time in the cool clear night air.  And life was good.

As if eating ice cream before dinner last week wasn't bad enough, guess who dined at Limon Rotisserie AFTER stopping by both Bi-Rite AND Humphry Slocombe Monday night? Yup, Suany Fat Pants. My fat ass needs to be spanked...hard! I sampled the infamous Salted Caramel, which was good, but nothing to wet my granny panties over. My favorites were Earl Grey and Roasted Banana. Unlike the distinct tastes in Humphry Slocombe ice cream, most of Bi-Rite's flavors have a uniform note which makes differentiation difficult after sampling several varieties. While I enjoyed my visit here, my adventurous taste buds will most likely be steering me toward Humphry Slocombe in the future.

Oh my goodness!!!! The Sam's Sundae was everything I thought, hoped, wished and dreamed it would be. Completely lived up to my super high expectations of pretty much ice cream sundae perfection. Chocolate ice cream is my last choice of ice cream ever but topped with that maldon sea salt and bergamot olive oil this sundae is pure genius! The house made whip that was fluffed on the side was amazing and added the perfect creaminess to each salted-chocolaty-orange essence olive oily bite. We went around 10pm and even with the chilly San Fransico wind, there was a line out the door! I stopped by first at the little "Bi-Rite express" window to find out that that window only sells soft serve and cookies and cupcakes. The guy working was super friendly and gave me a sample of their Balsamic Strawberry and Vanilla swirl froyo yo. Ummm delicious! If I didn't have my hear already set on Sam I would have been happy with a soft serve and a cupcake to-go. Even though the line was long it moved super fast. Well and it helps to when you know what you want. They have so many awesome sounding ice cream selections to choose from. I would have loved to try them all (or at least 2 or 3) but I didn't want to be "that person". Staff was friendly and put my sundae together fast. A Sam's Sundae from Bi-Rite will now forever be a permanent stop in my SF visit itinerary. They have stamp cards available and even though I live roughly 398.2 miles away, I took one anyway.

Nothing sweeter than taking a walk through the neighborhood, strolling through the park hand in hand and then getting ice cream. I've been wanting to try out Bi-Rite Creamery, it was on my list of to-eat's. After a few samples, I was stuck between the Salted Caramel and the Honey Lavender. I went with the Honey Lavender because the taste was unlike anything else that I had. My crush had the Brown Sugar, which was very good and he was super sweet enough to share with me. I think his was better than mine, but still both were very tasty. Life is sweet, enjoy it to the fullest.

Rounding out the San Francisco ice cream shop tour for me is Bi-Rite Creamery.  Freakin finally!  I got a scoop of toasted coconut and a scoop of cookies and cream.  Both were very dense ice cream flavors, almost like a gelato.   The toasted coconut is like a dream come true for me, because I love adding toasted coconut to my plain vanilla ice cream at home.  I felt like I was in Hawaii livin' it up by the beach. The cookies and cream flavor is nothing to write home about, but that's probably because my palette was overwhelmed by the delicious coconut that I tried first.  Consider it your 'safe' ice cream flavor.   I can understand now why I have to fight for parking and stand in line outside of the shop just to order. Bi-Rite or Humphrey Slocombe or Mitchell's?  Hell it's ice cream so I like all of them!

Bi-Rite has some amazing ice cream. Do yourself a favor and get the sundae. Make sure salted caramel is one of the flavors. If you love fudge and toffee, by all means, request these toppings. The berry compote is also delicious. The line is long, but this ice cream is worth it. Eat it there or bring it over to Dolores Park on a beautiful day. Reasonable prices, unique flavors, fantastic quality. Parking can be annoying, though!

Ice cream lovers will love Bi-Rite. I'm more of a frozen yogurt person, ice cream is a little too rich even for me, but I tried it anyway because its on both of my current lists: #35 on Big Eat SF and #75 on Yelp's top 100: Salted caramel ice cream and Bi-Rite Creamery If I were smart, I would have sampled the salted caramel and ordered mint chip, to be guaranteed happiness. But I'm not smart, and I just went straight to the ordering and had a cone with salted caramel and brown sugar with ginger caramel swirls. The salted caramel was too salty for my liking. I liked the brown sugar better, but it still wasn't amazing.  In retrospect there were many preferable flavor options besides the mint chip.....vanilla with peanut butter, balsamic strawberry, cinnamon with snickerdoodle....I really ordered all wrong. The ice cream is high quality, and I do understand why people like it, but I doubt I'll wait in line for it again.

You know who I'm not a big fan of? Sweets. That's who. Before you give me that look, step off and observe my new cavity. The first cavity I've had since age 7, when I routinely stuffed my face with anything that my mom forbid me to eat. Ya, I was one of those kids who brought all-natural peanut butter sandwiches and carrot sticks to school. I was also the kid who tried to "up for grabs" my trail mix in exchange for a rice crispy treat. Unfortunately the other kids seemed to outsmart me, and I was usually stuck eating my stupid unprocessed, unwhitebread sandwiches. But I'm all growns up now. I live by myself, I buy my own food, and I make my own g-d damn choices....choices that lead to sugary worm holes forming in my teeth. But you see, I really don't eat that many sweets. Once and a while I'll accept a slice of cheesecake, or a half a brownie, or half of a berry pie. You see? I'm good. I'm healthy. I prefer salty over sweet....like Bi-Rite's salted caramel ice cream. You see tooth!!! Salt! It was salt for f*cks sake, you shit bag tooth! Don't you get it?? It was salty, with a hint of sweetness and a whole bucketful of delicious. It was melty and creamy and OH FINE! It was sugary!!! I get my new trusty filling in July 11th. Mark your calendar tooth because the next day I'm gonna treat you to something real special like. Something salty, something creamy, something that will most likely drill a mutherf*cking big ass hole in your neighbor.

I am fixin' to blaspheme! Y'all know I LOVE ice cream. Y'all know I am on a diet which prohibits me from having my sweet, true love ice cream on a regular basis. So y'all know that getting any kind of ice cream is like giving a drop of ice water to a man coming out the Sahara for me. . . I NEED IT!  I WANT IT!!!   The first time I came to Bi-Rite was when it first opened. . .nary a soul in there.  Just me and my friend and a girl behind the counter as droopy as a wilted flower.  My friend has a thick German accent and when she'd ask the girl a question, the girl would roll her eyes and say. . .BIG SIGH . ."I really can't understand you. .WHAT??"  This went on three or four times until my friend just ordered whatever and we left.  Our ice cream was bitter because it was served by bitter hands.  I never reviewed it because I figured this girl had to be an anomaly.   The two stars are for the kind and lovely staff I encountered there the other night.  There was a crew of three and they were stellar.  They even let me use the restroom even though it's only for employees - - ah heck I am adding a star just for that. .the crew were sweethearts! But let's get to the matter at hand shall we?   I ordered a sundae with HOT fudge.  Chocolate ice cream and a malted vanilla ice cream with some sort of stuff in it. . I can't remember because there was so little "stuff" in the ice cream.  Topped with HOT fudge, whipped cream and toasted walnuts.   Look, I love ice cream.  I really do and this stuff was just meh.  It melted super fast which means there is lots of air in it.  Meh.  The HOT fudge was not hot nor was it good. . very dense and one dimensional in flavor and mouth feel.   Um. .. the whipped cream was good?   Anyway, and this is where it gets serious. . . I ate a few bites of the chocolate side.  I ate a few bites of the melted vanilla malt and then I THREW IT AWAY.   That's some serious shit folks. . .it was not worth the calories and I don't think I've ever met an ice cream that was not worth the calories!   Save your money or go to Mitchell's (and yes, I know that Mitchell's isn't organic or small batched or whatever but what Mitchell's is . . is good!).  I was so disappointed here. . .I couldn't believe how meh everything was.   I kept waiting to see the naked emperor walk by.

There's so much hype for this place that I had to try it out! And of course I decided to try it out on one of the hottest day in April. The line was pretty long, and after waiting moving up the line a few inches after 20 mins, I decided to go to dinner first then come back when the line was shorter. After dinner and drinks, we came back to Bi-Rite and line was still long! However, it moved a lot quicker than before and was able to order around 20-30 minutes. So much goodness to choose from! I ended up ordering salted caramel and earl grey ice cream. I wasn't a fan of salted caramel, but earl grey was so good! I tried the cookies n cream and that was pretty good too. Ice cream craving satisfied.

How have I not written a review about this place already?! Everyone keeps raving about the salted caramel, but my absolute favorite is the ricanelas: cinnamon ice cream with little bits of snickerdoodle. It kind of reminds me of horchata! Don't let the long line deter you...it's so so worth it! The place is tiny and there's only a few stools to sit, so I'd suggest bringing your ice cream over to Dolores Park and eating it there :)

From what I gather, BiRite is one of the SF Ice Cream Trinity:  Humphrey Slocombe, Mitchell's, and BiRite.  Finally made it out to BiRite on a Saturday afternoon and there is a long line.  But everyone in the line is happy, unlike the lines at DMV, so I get in line, too, with my friends. Several people recommended the Salted Caramel and Balsamic Strawberry.  Both sound good so I get a scoop of each and only after I ordered I remembered my doctor had told me to refrain from eating too much ice cream this week.  Oh well. Both were creamy yummy and the flavors were expressed truthfully, but as a combo, the intensity of the Salted Caramel overshadowed the the subtle balance in the flavors of the Balsamic Strawberry.   Well, that's my fault. In the end, I thoroughly enjoyed my ice cream, the company of my friends, and I didn't even mind waiting in line, so yes, I am a fan.

Believe the hype! What could be better on a hot summer day than full fat ice cream? It's tantamount to inner peace! If you're on a diet, just get a cup with a scoop of salted caramel (to massage your taste buds) and a scoop of ginger (to add a bit of zing). Getting only one scoop is pointless, because you'll just have to walk back five blocks to get another 10 minutes later. It's that irresistible on a warm afternoon when the Bay Bridge is closed down. Oh, and don't eat it in Dolores Park, as that's too close....then you'll end up eating four scoops and blowing out the diet. UPDATE: The Brown Butter Pecan is only so-so : ( UPDATE: On further examination, the Brown Butter Pecan is pretty darn good! NEWSFLASH: Additional research shows that Balsamic Strawberry is significantly better than Brown Butter Pecan.

I have to admit that I eat more ice cream than I probably should. It's my "thing." I can't say no when it's in front of me. It shocks me that I've lived in SF for 5 years and last weekend was my first time trying Bi-Rite. I honestly can't think of a time that I had something better. Maybe in Italy? They have really unique flavors like Salted Caramel and Brown Sugar. When I originally saw these flavors I felt jipped. What the hell is this? Where's my chocolate? Where's my strawberry? When I got to the front of a line I tentatively started tasting... and instantaneously my idea about what was good ice cream, was gone! It was nearly agonizing coming to a decision. I ended up with coffee toffee and it was like no other coffee ice cream. It was rich and creamy with the perfect balance of crunch. I took it over to Dolores Park, munched away and had a perfect afternoon.

What is the first thing that comes to mind on a very, very cold night in San Francisco? Ice Cream! I'm a Mitchell's guy and love their tropical flavors and I've heard of Bi-Rite Creamery. I've never had the chance to compare the two, so after eating some spicy Burmese dish, we wanted some cold dessert to counteract the spiciness in our tummy with some sweetness, and this was the perfect night for it. Just like Mitchell's, the line goes out the door and wraps around the corner. Like a perfect tag-team, I dropped off the wifey so she can wait in line while I looked for a place to park. After circling around for several times, finally found a space a block away. By the time I checked with the wifey, she was almost halfway through the line. We looked at the menu, checked Yelp app on the iPhone and the first thing that pops out is the Salted Caramel. Everyone seems to be raving about it. Also, it's a rotating menu and advertised as an Artisan ice cream. Translation: they can charge you whatever they feel like it. But after having a nibble, it's damn worth it. Now, I had trepidation about ordering the Salted Caramel since I am not fond of Caramel very much, and I didn't....my wifey did. I did have the Coffee Toffee, Roasted Banana and Toasted Coconut while the wifey had the Salted Caramel, Coffee Toffee and Malted Vanilla. Plain this is absolutely not. They are bursting with flavors and the ingredients are fresh. It's not too sweet either and a perfect blend of creaminess. When I did taste the Salted Caramel, I began to understand what the fuss was all about. Holy Mackerel Sweet Mother of Mary....this flavor was new and quite a revelation. Yes, I need to come here more often and i don't care if parking is an adventure and the line takes longer than a foreign movie to end. It's damn worth it. Hey, I'll still love Mitchell's, and this just means there's another place to choose from. Let me put if this way: Mitchell's is a Ferrari and Bi-Rite is a Lamborghini. Their both unique and cream of the crop. Or better yet...Ice Cream of the crop.

Hmmm I've had better. I was presented with two options; wait in the long que for the full variety of ice creams available or go to the second que for the limited soft serve ice cream. If I had more time and there wasn't a que I would go back to try the former. However for me, I went for the soft serve, you are only as strong as your weakest member and this should hold for the different types of ice cream Bi rate serves too. I wasn't impressed. I couldn't taste the quality of the cream and in comparison to other soft serve ice cream, Bi rate did not measure up for me.

The song "Perfect Day" by Lou Reed pretty much sums up today, Saturday January 13, 2007.  Insert "ate the best ever ice cream in the park" for the "sangria in the park" part. . .but yes, it was a perfect day. Who knew Bi-Rite opened a Creamery?  My lovely friend did that's who!   To my dismay, utter utter dismay I should emphasize, they make SALTED CARAMEL ice cream.  This is the last thing I need, really. The shop itself is adorable.  Location is across from Dolores Park which is the perfect place to enjoy your ice cream.  In addition to ice cream, they offer an assortment of delicious looking baked goods, and a unique selection of gourmet chocolate sauce.  They make, what looked like, amazing hot chocolate.  Actually the hot chocolate special was called "Extreme Hot Chocolate"  Lady sitting next to me ordered the hot chocolate, took a sip, and kept saying, "oh my God, oh my God, this hot chocolate is, oh my God, so good" I guess it was good.   But let's get back to the ice cream. . . I ordered a medium sized cup with two scoops - one salted caramel and one ginger.   I can't remember how much it cost but it doesn't even matter.  This is by far the best ice cream I've ever had in my whole life.  Whatever I paid, it was worth it.  The salted caramel ice cream was the perfect combination of sweet and savory flavors.  The ginger ice cream was incredibly rich with ginger flavor and generous with bits of fresh ginger.  This is serious ice cream.  Great texture, fresh flavors. Oohs, and ahhh's ensued from the first to the last bite.  This was four people oohing, and ahhhing consistently throughout the whole ice cream eating extravaganza.   I'm not a huge ice cream person but I'll make room, no matter how full I am, for a scoop (or two!) at Bi-Rite Creamery.  That's just how darn good it is! Grrrrrrrrrrrr!

When I first tried the brown sugar/ginger/caramel ice-cream, I don't know if I wanted to cry tears of happiness, sing from the top of a mountain (well, dolores park will do), or punish myself for not having had it sooner. I ended up doing none of the above, instead opting to stare blankly into the distance until my friend asked me if I was okay. When I woke up from my food coma, I realized this might be the single best ice cream flavor I have ever tried. It's not like it was the most original thing I have ever encountered, and I wanted to take away 1 star because the consistency is not as dense as I would like it to be (think Double Rainbow), but somehow they made the balance of the 3 flavors work to perfection, so I had to go with 5. The other flavors are definitely delicious, and it's worth going back on numerous occasions to find your favorite (the salted caramel is quite popular). As for me, I have finally found my one true love and I will never leave its side again!

I actually prefer gelato over ice cream, but there's two flavors that have essentially guaranteed my Bi-Rite lifetime patronage. Salted caramel: 10 stars Meyer lemon: 9 stars Yes, I would give the Creamery 19 stars if I could. But that's it--I'm not rounding up to 20 even for the roasted banana.

I don't know what I can really add to Bi-Rite's 1000+ reviews. Short and quick..... SALTED CARAMEL!!!! - Smooth, not "salty" at all (well maybe a little), right amount of sweetness YUMM! Malted Vanilla- I've never been a fan of malt but when the boyfriend said it was delicious I knew I had to give it a try. Now I know why I love him so much, he never lies =) it was DELICIOUS. I really wanted to try the pumpkin flavor since Thanksgiving is just right around the corner but I didn't. Damn...why didn't I try it! =( Bi-Rite Creamery sell flavors by pints as well. $5.99 for a pint of awesome-ness!!! haha

Honey Lavender, Salted Caramel, and Ginger ice cream, all three delectable flavors nestled in a compostable cup and topped with a sugar cone, are an amazing treat for a day as warm and beautiful as today. Bi-Rite has been hyped up in my mind for some time now, and upon recent discovery of the East Bay ice creamery, Ici (Berkeley), I've been skeptical whether or not Bi-Rite's offerings were competitor worthy.  Well, believe the hype because Bi-Rite Creamery makes some really amazing stuff.  Rich in flavor, smooth and creamy in texture...each flavor was distinct and well-balanced.   My only complaint is that I didn't find any of the other flavors (aside from the three I mentioned above) appealing to me, unlike that piece of heaven they call Meyer Lemon Ice Cream from Ici.  So I'm giving Bi-Rite a 4.5-star rating unless they come up with something amazing like, I don't know, "Organic Meyer Lemon Ice Cream That's As Good As Ici's But You Don't Have To Drive Over The Bridge For It" flavor, you know what I'm saying? SIDE NOTE:  Please be aware of birds overhead when standing in line for Bi-Rite.  I got shat on.

GOD. 2000+ miles away living the dream in (arguably) the greatest city in the world, and all i can think about it about is a quaint little shop on the corner of 18th & Dolores. Quick tip: If you plan on driving, DON'T. Take BART to 16th & Mission and walk off all the calories you're about to consume. If you really, really have to, drive up 18th st. past Mission High (Dolores Park will be on your left) and turn left onto the first street after the park, that goes uphill. There's usually a couple clutch parking spots...though probably after this review, there won't be. Whoopsies. Second tip: Bring a book or your favorite person or a hot date because if you go during the best time to go (a warm weekend), there will be a line down to Chinatown. Not really. Just tried to make it rhyme but I'm failing. Not gonna lie...just trying to get to Elite here. No time to be funny or clever. I sound like a douchebag. Third tip: I will swear by Honey Lavender until the day I die (probably from eating too much Honey Lavender), but 9/10 people don't like it because they're lame-os. Okay, so it tastes like potpurri. But tasty potpurri!!!! If you don't like the tasty of creamy soap in your mouth, go for the Ricanelas. It is a cinnamon sugar blend with real chunks of soft Snickerdoodle cookies. Other popular flavors are Roasted Banana, Earl Grey, and Salted Caramel. Fourth tip: Savor the moment, but eat it quickly. Since the ingredients are all-natural, the ice cream melts pretty quickly Fifth tip: Hang out at Dolores Park for one of the best views of SF and prime SF people-watching. Last time I was there, I carefully eye-stalked a pink poodle, two druggies (one of which temptingly offered a massage in exchange for some maryjane), a guy playing congo drums, two hot guys that I was praying to Madonna wasn't gay, but of course I was wrong, and about fifty crushed cans of PBR (an SF staple if there was one). Sixth tip: Eat, lick, slurp, and be merry.

Is there such thing as ambrosia? According to Wikipedia, ambrosia is "the food, sometimes the drink, of the Greek gods (or demigods), often depicted as conferring ageless immortality upon whoever consumes it." I would like to respectfully disagree with Wikipedia's take on this one. Ambrosia is found right here on earth, and it's sold by the cone and the pint at Bi-Rite Creamery in San Francisco. What exactly does this ambrosia consist of, you ask?  The answer is malted vanilla, milk chocolate chip, peanut brittle ice cream. In case you were wondering, those are NOT 3 different flavors.  The mad scientists (or are they Greek gods?) at Bi-Rite combine all 3 of those flavor layers to create the greatest ice cream in the history of man. And I got to taste it this past weekend! After spending a long Saturday afternoon getting sunburned at Dolores Park, I hopped over to Bi-Rite for a little cool-down.  Little did I know that Bi-Rite would be an utterly orgasmic ice cream experience, and it would manifest in the form of a heaping cone of malted vanilla, milk chocolate chip, peanut brittle ice cream. One lick of this thing and I was walking on air.  It more than made up for the long line to get in. Thanks to Bi-Rite, I think I can die happy.  (Sadly, while Bi-Rite ice cream is supremely delicious, this ambrosia doesn't confer immortality, omnipotent super-deity-style.)

Bi-Rite is a win-win for all.   You get the experimental flavors (orange cardamon and earl grey) along with your standards AND they make the best sundaes! The lines are long, but don't be pushed away because they move fast.   Favorite combo: Earl Grey and Lemon (when available) Favorite sundae:  There was one that was like a giant smore and another featured their banana ice cream.  DELISH!

I came here today (second time), but I hadn't reviewed my first visit. FIrst visit. I came here on a Saturday afternoon with a friend to try Bi-Rite for the first time. I had the Salted Caramel with a scoop of Brown Sugar Ice Cream (single in a cup). The consistency of the ice cream was too soft for my liking, but the flavors were spectacular. Second visit. I came again with some underclassmen this afternoon after walking around the area briefly. The line was a 5-minute wait. After sampling the Orange Cardamom and the Orange Sorbet, I decided on the Orange Cardamom in a kid's scoop. There was practically a perfect balance between the orange flavoring/zest and the spice--the perfect balance of sweet and savory in the ice cream. I think I just found my new favorite ice cream flavor here. Bi-Rite Creamery's a must-try if you're on the lookout for ice cream on a sunny afternoon!

I was so incredibly happy to FINALLY be going to Bi-Rite for ice cream.  Bi-Rite has become the ice cream shop equivalent of Hawaii for me.   Everyone in my family, including mother, father, sister, brother, second cousin once-removed and a random great-aunt has been to Hawaii.  Almost everyone I know has been to Hawaii.  Except me.  I'm starting to get a complex. So my Bi-Rite complex has been growing because practically everyone I know has been there, fallen in love with one or more flavors and keeps telling me about them.  Repeatedly.   For my very first ever taste of this nirvana of frozen treats, I selected a dense, dark chocolate and a light, crisp ginger.  Both were delicious.  Both were gone in about 3 seconds.  Neither gave me a headache. I have to tell you, though...I wouldn't stand in a long line for it.  It was great ice cream, no argument there.  But in the world of "yes I will waste calories and $$ on this" sweet treats - it's not worth a line around the block.

"Fatty Watty two by four, Couldn't squeeze her out the door..." We all know the story about poor Fatty Watty and her ever-expanding ass...Well, they may as well change the name to Fatty Autumn Two by Four. Because I am in love with a dangerous man! Dangerous man, Salted Caramel is thy name. And I have never, ever, never, never had it as good as Salty gives it to me. His friends, Lavender Honey and Cheesecake come in at a close second and third, but my loins and my tastebuds cry out for old Salty first and foremost. I managed to avoid this den of dirty pleasures until very recently. Upon my first visit, I was plied with sample after sample and two scoops for the price of my ass. Now, I'm playing favorites with my clients because of them. I run, breathless to my client meetings that put me in the vicinity of Bi-Rite and trudge resentfully to the meetings that do not. I am an addict. And soon I will be so fat that you will no longer recognize me. But it's ok. Salty loves fat sex. Tight ass and taught tummy, it's been swell! But I'm onto BIGGER and better things...

Sure, why not be review #1851, ya know? When I heard that the lineup was only 45 minutes long, I squealed - not in disbelief but because that was half the amount of time I'd. When shit's yelped in San Francisco, expect lineups. Even moreso if it's in The Mission and a major hipster magnet. I got a double portion ($4.75) with three flavours. From favourite to least: 1. Salted caramel: Oh. My. Gustav. Soooo good. On a return visit I'd totally fill up a bowl with just this flavour alone. 2. Brown sugar with caramel swirl. One of the flavours of the day. This was surprisingly the most plain of the three that I picked. It was good, but not strong enough of a flavour for me to remark on. 3. Creme fraiche: No.

What a better way to follow up dessert then with dessert... but not any dessert but with Ice Cream and not just any Ice Cream but Bi Rite Ice Cream. After me Daniel L. and Kent P.had a decadent indulgent of amazingly sweet pastries at the wonderful Tartine Bakery... what did we do? We went to have more dessert...Lol....Yes us sweet ahoholics went trenching over to the wonderful Fabulous Bi Rite...The much longed, much dreamed about place- that I have so eagerly been  wanting to try. The place is much smaller then  I had envisioned with only but a bench outside for seating, the line was not that bad at all (whew)...but still a little line. They had flavors all the way from Honey Lavender (AMAZING) fresh rich sweet and beautiful also Kent P.s favorite ... Crème Fraiche...Ok....Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl....Mmmm yum another favorite......Salted Caramel.....Most popular and I can so see why...Wow....there were many other flavors, they rotate daily and those were just a few for that day...Being a little stuffed on previous desserts..: ) I opted for a child size of the oh so.. So wonderful Ricanelas (cinnamon with snicker doodles) All flavors were rich, sweet and heavenly delicious....wish I had more room to indulge ....next time....next time... Were so bad....: )

Now I have heard so many many people raved about how good their ice cream here so I thought I outta give it a try since I am in this part of town.  Finding this ice cream place can be a little challenged.  I did not know that they have a Bi-Rite market so of course, I wonder into their like a stupid person loss and looking for ice cream. Once I finally got to the right place, there was a line down the street.  So of course, I waited for some ice cream.  I might add, it was a bit nippy in San Francisco that afternoon.  All I could think is that it better be good and worth the wait.  I was soooooo wrong.  Once I got to order, I found that there are only so many flavors to choose from.  They didn't even have any of the tropical flavors that I seen in other ice cream parlors.  Very disappointed.  I ordered the coconut toasted ice cream.  Did not see any coconut and it was just plain.  It wasn't creamy like Mitchell and even in some of the store bought ice creams tasted better.  Nothing special about this place at all.  Yet there are so many people waiting in line for it.   I guess, if you waited long enough that you have to convince yourself that it is good just to make your conscience at peace. What made it even more painful is the fact that it took almost 30-45 minutes to find parking for ok ice cream.

Now that I've been to Humphrey Slocombe's and to Mrs. and Mrs. Miscellaneous several times, I can review Bi-Rite's with a more well-rounded perspective. As San Franciscans, we're spoiled when it comes to ice cream, so it's tough for an ice cream joint to stand out. So my review is going to be comparative, because Bi-Rite's is only as good as its San Francisco competition, right? Location: I'm totally biased. Not only did I grow up 1/2 block away on Oakwood & 18th, but I am in love with Dolores Park. This is one of the most beautiful areas of San Francisco. Selection: Bi-Rite has a much wider selection of ice cream than H.S. and Mr/Mrs, which rotate 10 flavors daily. Bi-Rite's menu is ideal if you have a favorite flavor that you like sticking to. Taste: Bi-Rite masters the balance between unique flavor offerings that also taste good. IMO, Humphrey's tends to be hit-or-miss and tries too hard to be different. But everything from Bi-Rite has been delish! My favorite combo at the moment is roasted banana with salted caramel. A deliciously magical combination! They score equally to Mr/Mrs in this respect. Other top flavor contenders.... - Balsamic strawberry: Didn't taste like vinegar at all, which is probably a good thing. The strawberry was ultra creamy and velvety :) - Coffee toffee: More coffee than toffee. Coffee ground is sprinkled throughout, giving it a kick. But it totally works :) The only reason I don't visit Bi-Rite more often is because the lines are insanely long! My sisters and I tried going during last week's heat wave, but when we drove past and saw the line wrapped around the block, there was a resounding "Oh HEEELLL no!!" in the car. So we turned around and went to Mr and Mrs. You make me sad, Bi-Rite. Why must you have so many fans!? You should consider selling Express Passes, like the ones they sell at Great America that let you cut to the front of the line. I'd pay extra not to have to wait in line. If you decide to implement my idea, I will accept payment in ice cream. So sadly, I'm limited to enjoying their tasty treats only on cold evenings (when there is no wait), since I refuse to wait hours for ice cream, delicious as it may be. But considering their ultra-hip Dolores Park location, I'm not surprised they're the most popular kid on the block :)

What? SF why were you throwing me your minor league eats during the first part of my stay? As 948645 can attest on this site, if you aren't eating Bi-Rite Creamery ice cream, you aren't living right. Either you: a.) have no friends because no one has hipped you to the bliss of creamy love and complete acceptance (you'll never leave me, ice cream!); b.) you are pure evil and are barred from entering into the doors of Bi-Rite; or c.) you haven't been born yet. Because I can't imagine a world in which parents willingly deny their children this ice cream unless they are members of a.) and/or b.) My Bi-Rite experience: Salted Caramel ice cream, Brown Sugar ice cream, Roasted Banana ice cream, Brownie Sundae, Caramel sauce, whipped cream, toasted nuts, cherry, hot summer night, good friends, a wait time that wasn't as bad as forecasted, the sugar shakes, "Are you okay? Your leg hasn't stopped moving since you sat down." "Give me MORE ice cream!" "Are you su... ?" "ME WANT MORE ICE CREAM!!!!" "... I think you're done, John."

This place is a pretty good small creamery. I guess they make their own ice cream (and even cakes!) After dinner, we struggled to find parking at 7:45pm. We luckily beat the rush, taste tested several flavors (with real metal spoons), and ordered. I got the ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles). I like how there were chunks of snickerdoodles in it, but I realized how sweet this ice cream was when I tried my other friends' ice creams. Honey lavender is pretty good and bland (but not in a bad way). The Coffee Toffee flavor is interesting because it's crunchy with the toffee and kinda bitter with the coffee. The toasted coconut is yummy with coconut strips (: Roasted banana was okay, but wasn't that different from a banana ice cream from elsewhere. The basil, well, tasted like basil. It was interesting, but I didn't want that in my ice cream. The variety of special flavors would be a reason for me to come. But the quality of ice cream is only a little better than other creameries. I still prefer Preston's in Burlingame (:

Okay I have been here twice this year alone and I don't even live up here ^_^  The first time I would have given them 4 stars (http://www.kats9lives.co…) but the recent trip I would give it 5 stars.  So I am going to bump them up to 5 stars when it's 4.5 stars. I think one part that made this visit better was that there was no line! I know it's shocking, but we went when it was really cold and nobody was there.  Much more fun and less pressure on moving the line and keeping quiet lol.  We were in and out within 5 mins.  Score! I LOVE their Salted Caramel... it has just the right sweetness with a hint of bitter saltiness... it kind of reminds me of burnt sugar, yummy! ^_^ Ever since last time I have been thinking about getting more so this time I just grabbed a nice tub from the freezer while I was there shopping for more ice cream flavors to try.   The first time I was here, I was not that big of a fan of what I had.  This time I got to take my time and choose what I wanted after trying them out... all the flavors were great and flavorful.  The Salted Caramel alone is worth coming for! I also liked the Honey Lavender this time around because it was just the right amount of flavor.  Not too overpowering and not soapy tasting.  All the ice creams here have a great consistency and are really flavorful.   I miss you Bi-Rite! ~XOXOXO! ^_-

I am not a waiting in line person, so it was with some trepidation that I agreed to get some ice cream at Bi-Rite. Don't get me wrong, I've been wanting to go here for sometime, if anything to see what all the cold buzz was about. So finally, this Saturday afternoon, after going on an urban hike from DMV Heights to the Nission via Hayes Valley, our "yosse" ventured forth. Yeah, there was a line, but surprisingly it moved along smoothly. There are some nice benches outside to enjoy the day, also to lick your ice cream in the faces of those still waiting. Flavors: Of course the Salted Caramel is just as good as everyone says, but so is the Balsamic Strawberry. Heck, I'm going to go out on a proverbial limb here and say that almost all of their flavors are delicious and fresh. Will need to experiment of course, so more outings are planned. And next time, I'm gonna try a sundae, don't try and stop me.

I've been intrigued...Bi-Rite Creamery has been on the hot list on Yelp for awhile and I finally got to see what the craze is all about! With no parking in the area, I was dropped off around 7:30 (no line) and sent into the unknown.  I hopped back into the car with a Double ($4.75 for two to three flavor choices) of Brown Butter Pecan, Snickerdoodles with Cinnamon, and Salted Caramel.  (They were out of Mexican Hot Chocolate.) After the first bite, the Husband insisted we return again after dinner!  This time it was 10 pm and a line that was snaking along the block.  We got the Double again, this time Salted Caramel, Toffee Coffee, and Snickerdoodles with Cinnamon.  The Salted Caramel is what everyone is talking about and it's so good...we like to think of it as See's Butterscotch Kisses!   Yes, a bit more expensive but you can taste the quality.  And it really is worth the wait because it was that good.

I was walking in the park, holding a three scoop Bi-Rite sunday when I realized something that made me a bit sad. I have never been stared at with the abject lust that my ice-cream was receiving from passersby. Bi-Rite makes some fine examples of tastiness, the salted caramel ice cream being a personal favorite. Be aware, there will be a line when you go. Now, I have been to three ice-cream parlors that consistently have long lines. Bi-Rite's wait to taste ratio is by far the best. It's worth it. Trust me. Next time I'm in San Francisco, I expect to go to Bi-Rite Creamery. On that day I will hold my treat close to the face and pretend that those looks are meant for me.

Lactardation be damned.  Despite the non-catchy, unmemorable name, Bi-Rite's ice cream was worth the 20 minute wait (winter, outside), the jelly belly (gelatinous, yet comforting), and chins (double, cascading into a triple because we returned the very next day).   It's that good.   Highly recommended, the Ricanelas was a cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodles. Oh hi.  Desserts are not my thing, but this flavor caused me to sob audibly into my eco-friendly napkin.   And then.   The famed Salted Caramel.  Burnt brown sugar cream magic may be an appropriate descriptor; thankfully, salt was NOT the first flavor.  This blew my mind.     Courtesy for my companions prevented me from slobbering over the liquid remains, but now, days later, despair.  Because I'm still thinking of that dreamy salted caramel, and SF is 1,250,000 miles away.  If anyone, ANYONE, can find me an equivalent in NY, I promise to buy you a jumbo cup.     And the SF locals KNOW, evidenced by the 2,000+ reviews.  NY'kers visiting the left coast, please bookmark and gorge accordingly.   Bi-Rite.  Better than sax, including a Bill Clinton solo.

Who doesn't scream for ice cream? Especially when the flavors are white chocolate raspberry swirl, honey lavender, and malted vanilla with peanut brittle. Expect a line-up every time, but good things come to those who wait.

This week I decided to find out what everyone was slapping their grandmas over and had 2 scoops at bi-rite. The guy at the counter was incredibly friendly even with the onslaught of people he had to deal with all day. I got a scoop of roasted banana (heaven) and chocolate in a cone then happily licked my way back to my bus stop on Mission. WOW. Everyone, I mean everyone must really love their ice cream because all I heard on the street as a passed was: "Mmmmm, baby that sure does look good" "Can I get a lick of that?" "I'd love to be that cone" "Ohhh gurl I want summa that ice cream" "Daym that's tasty" For which I happily replied: "It's delicious. Thank you!" From what I ascertained,  you Mission folk sure are friendly and you sure do love your ice cream.

I'm a dessert person. I intentionally save room while eating dinner just to have tummy space for ice cream. Steak? yes - I love it ... ice cream though?? I love it even MORE! I took a nice stroll through the city to get to Bi-Rite (in the hopes of burning off even just a small percentage of what I was about eat) and found myself in total awe at their selection of unique and creative flavors. In Seattle we're spoiled with Molly Moon's and Bluebird - but dangit' Bi-Rite, you kick butt! Rumor has it that their salted caramel and balsamic strawberry flavors are even better than Molly's. I opted for something totally new and got the roasted banana. Such a great choice! The ice cream was smooth and rich, the cones were fresh, and the service was quick. A line over 20 people long was scooted in and out the doors in less than 15 minutes. Pretty great! For this ice cream, I'd stand in line on a cold winter night anytime!

Three tiny, delicious words: SOFT SERVE WINDOW. (Well, that should just be two words, I think, if you do the properly hyphenated "soft-serve window." Stay with me, people!) Bi-Rite Creamery's newest expansion into the former Stem store (though I was sad to see that one go) is all I expected it to be and more. Combo of the day was enormous and damn good: vanilla soft-serve, peanut brittle and milk-chocolate pieces. The mister's caramel-covered vanilla was a winner. As if I needed another reason to come back here,.

Okay. Bi-Rite convert. Salted caramel is like my mind exploding and for some reason makes me think of strippers. The chocolate was lovely, like rainbows and kittens. I still think that Mitchell's is more creamy and reminiscent of my childhood making ice cream from scratch. Bi-Rite is more of a flavor knockout and the creaminess dissolves in your mouth later. Kind of like a french kiss.

Ice cream and I have a rocky relationship at best.  It's like a BFF that is going to stab me in the back later so I have to tread very carefully.  However, when I found out everybody had their panties in a bunch over this place, I naturally had to see what all the hooplah was about.  Yes, I'm a gambler and have played more than one round of Russian roulette to let anything as silly as pain stop me.   Saturday we just so happened to be in the area on another excursion only to find a crowd with a line around the corner.  Seriously?  For ice cream?? Now, I'm really curious BUT there is no way in hells bells I'm standing in that line.  Instead I wait.  A whole 24hrs (ok technically it was 16) and go back the next morning...when it opened.  No lines suckers!!!  I would also like to add that ice cream for brunch is marvelous darling.  Sorry, evidently I'm a gloater as well! Tasted: Honey lavender - interesting (btw that means pass) Brown butter pecan - yum yum Salted Caramel - eh it was aiight.  Could have used a little more caramel and a little less salt     Balsamic Strawberry  -  sweet berry goodness Roasted banana. - bingo we have a winner.  BFF, oh how I have missed you! On the real, they were all so creamy and bursting with flavor.  My tummy (yippee) and I are smitten.  I would also like to extend a big thank you to my main man working the counter.  I wanted to take home a quart of that Roasted banana and all they had was a stinking pint (yeah that def would not do) so he kindly made me one.  It would appear he saw me inhaling my cup earlier too because the man really hooked me up (I totally heart you). 5 stars because I would sell my soul for just one bite!!!

Decided to stop by here spontaneously while in the city because one of my friends could not stop thinking about the ice cream here. It was my first time here and we were really lucky to beat the rush aka a stampede of little kids all ready to get their bi-rite on. I got the salted caramel and toffee coffee(?). The salted caramel was pretty good, but I think it's overhyped. On the other hand, the toffee coffee BLEW MY MIND! If you love coffee ice cream, then I guarantee that you'll love toffee coffee or coffee toffee.. whatever the hell the name is. I also tried my bf's honey lavender, but that wasn't for me. It tasted too much like flowers. If you're a fan of rose milk tea I'm sure you'd love this though! I ended up getting a single in a cone which came out to be $3.50 for both flavors. I secretly wanted a double but I didn't want to look like a fata$$ since all of my friends were getting singles too... Sigh :'( I also like that they let you sample any flavor(s) you want and there's no rush to choose. The staff was extremely friendly, the prices are reasonable, and the ice cream is super unique and super delicious. 5 stars for this joint! In the words of Arnold Schwarzenegger, "I'LL BE BACK!"

Yes, yes..  salted caramel is awesome and all but I prefer Mr. & Mrs. Miscellaneous better. It does pair well with balsamic strawberry (which itself is slightly more interesting than the Breyer's). I do love their roasted banana and toasted coconut. They truly taste like they were roasted and toasted! Malted vanilla was also good. They have this new flavor olive oil which I find underwhelming. Minuses: tough luck parking, long line and few seating. If you only want pints and quarts to go, you don't have to queue, just ask at the 2nd counter or grab some from the grocery store across the street.

I just had to come back after dreaming night after night about the Ricanela flavor (snickerdoodle in cinnamon ice cream). So after spending most of Summerthing craving a cone I dragged my friend there today. The last time I came was on a Sunday, but with the perfect weather and all the festivities around town the line went around the corner. Waiting in line was totally worth it, with music playing and handy menus being passed down the line. I was heartbroken that they didn't have Earl Grey today, but the creme fraiche and honey lavender made up for it. Plus the workers didn't seem fazed at all by the line, our scoops were served and paid for just as quickly as if there were no line at all. The best part was that a taste of my flavors plus a double of brown sugar and cherry chocolate brownie made my friend a believer!

Apparently, if you go at 5:30pm (on a Sunday night, as I did), when everyone else is presumably eating dinner, you can avoid the long ass lines.  I hate lines.  I don't wait in them unless the U.S. government has summoned me.  But since I got my citizenship, I wait for Homeland Security no more.  Suckers. Anyway, I tried going to Bi-Rite Creamery a couple times before, but there were all these crazies lined up around the building shivering in their winter coats.  That was a huge deterence.  I can handle fellow sugar addicts, but cold, wet, bored, potentially violent sugar addicts waiting to get their fix?  No thanks.   So yeah, when we passed BRC last night, I saw my chance and took it.  Turns out their ice cream's pretty decent.  It's really the fixins that give it the fourth star.  They use the quality goods.  We ordered the Brownie Sundae and the Berry Sundae (gotta try their sh*t before you start getting creative).   Most ice cream shoppes use the driest, nastiest piece of crusted chocolate in their brownie sundaes, but BRC actually uses a moist slab of brownie that one might even consider eating without the ice cream.  They top that mofo off with vanilla bean ice cream, hot fudge, caramel, and spiced pecans.  Their hot fudge is totally weak sauce, though.  Their Berry Sundae was a generous lump of ginger ice cream topped with a fresh, tart berry compote and bite-sized pieces of ginger snap cookies.  Not bad.   But come on, Mitchell's has halo halo.  And all kind of tropical flavors, like jackfruit and coconut.  The flavors of my people.  If you don't have halo halo and/or your hot fudge blows, you don't get 5 stars from me.  That's just the way it goes. *********************************** UPDATE: 06/27/2007 I have been craving Salted Caramel ice cream from Bi-Rite for 12 straight days.  I think this means Bi-Rite Creamery deserves 5 stars.

This place is uhhhhhh-MAZING !!!!!!!!!!!!! With over 1200 reviews and 4 1/2 stars on yelp, I had to try this place.  At first,  I was a bit hesitant to try this place because the salted caramel flavor and organic ingredients everyone was raving about just turned me off.  BUT, I am sooooooo glad I went to this place!!! It was hands down the most tasty ice cream I've ever had.  I tried the coffee toffee and one flavor, I forgot the name, but it had bits of snickerdoodle cookies in it!!  Amazing! Now, I haven't tried Mitchell's yet, and I know it's another Yelp favorite spot for ice cream, but I really can't see how ice cream can get any better than Bi-Rites at this point.

What's THIS?!  ANOTHER ice cream place??  Well ..... yeah! Went here the other night after a disappointing new restaurant in the area, but good wine and good company can overcome that. I've been here twice and have not been disappointed yet.  Too bad, both times, I couldn't finish what I ordered.  Both times I took some pints to go, and both times they were gone in a day.  The flavors rotate often, and are a cut above vanilla. I like the selection here, as it's not as "vanilla" as Humphrey Slocomb, which is it's only downfall.  Parking is non existent, and at least one side is a tow away zone at times, so be careful.

For my birthday, my husband took me to San Francisco for a day of museums and lunch. I couldn't decide whether I wanted to try the ice cream at Bi-Rite or at Humphry Slocombe, so he took me to both because he is really just the best. Bi Rite's ice cream was amazing. The texture was almost fluffy, yet substantial. We had the salted caramel and the honey lavender flavors. The salted caramel is so talked up, I thought it would be incredibly amazing, but it was only amazing. I thought it would be saltier. I like salt with my sweet, and that is what I was hoping for. It did, however, taste like delicious deep brown caramel straight off the stovetop. The honey lavender was even more amazing than I thought it would be. It was sweet like honey and its lavender aroma reminded me of the soap at Harbin Hot Springs. I would buy a large amount of this ice cream and get really fat with it. I'd love to try some of the other flavors, but I don't make it out to SF very often, and when i do it is to visit my lactose intolerant grandparents. Oh well, maybe for my next birthday...

All right!  About time I found a place worthy of a 5 star review.   First of all, I apologize for no pictures.  We stuffed our faces with our purchases before I could get around to bringing my camera out. ICE CREAM: OMFG.  I'm so mad at myself that, for all the years I was growing up in San Francisco, I never ventured to Bi-Rite for ice cream. I went and got gypped at Bombay Creamery instead.   My friend BK and I stopped by the soft serve stand first and sampled the balsamic vinegar strawberry soft serve.   HOLY SH*T.  That was so friggin delish I almost forgot that I was on a mission to try their actual scoopable ice cream and was about to break through the window and suck that soft serve directly out of the machine. Fields of strawberry dreams indeed! Thank God BK pulled me back by my collar and ushered me next door, or else I would have never sampled their unbelievably orgasmic brown butter and pecan flavor ice cream. Yum. Like eating a creamier pecan pie.  I also enjoyed a half scoop of roasted banana, which tasted like Entemann's banana cake - so that said, you either love it or you don't. I loved it. BK passed.   She instead opted for the honey lavendar, which I already know is amazing because I bought it in a pint before, and the ginger brown-sugar swirl, which is amazing and refreshing.   Both of our ice creams had JUST the right texture I like in my ice cream - firm and sticky and doesn't melt too quickly. It was hard to stop after one scoop, but well... gotta watch the expanding food baby... AMBIENCE: Very cute, small space with a few very small tables and chairs. Most people just grab their ice cream and enjoy it at nearby Dolores Park.  Service was friendly enough, nothing to write home about, although I did appreciate that the store uses all organic products and metal taster spoons that they wash and reuse rather than wasting plastic spoons. An "A" for environmental awareness! PRICES: $3.25 for a single scoop of up to 1-2 flavors.  A bit pricey, but not too bad when you consider the quality of the ingredients used. Also, if you get the punch card your 10th ice cream scoop is free. I'd say it's a place that gives Scoops in LA a run for its money. PARKING: Seriously, who would drive here when it takes longer to find parking in the Mission District than it does to drive here from anywhere in the city?  Street parking only.

On the prowl New Years day we were jonsin for some ice cream. We had our hearts set on Mitchells, but to no avail... they were closed. I really wanted to have some ube ice cream, drooool. We then proceeded to bi-rite to get our ice cream fix as a consolation. Since it was my first time, I of course had to try all the different flavors. I started with their most popular and then picked a few from there. I think I could get full on the samples alone since they give you full sized spoons filled with ice cream as a taster.  After the little tasting session we had settled on three scoops with salted caramel, malted vanilla with peanut brittle, and a brown sugar ice cream. It didn't hurt that the worker also had pointed out that they went well with one another. In order of favorite I have to say the brown sugar was number one followed by the malted vanilla, and the most popular salted caramel last.   All in all I don't think there was anything too special about bi-rite. I think ici or even fentons offers better ice cream, but different strokes for different folks. I ended up eating some store bought jamocha almond fudge with a brownie thrown in it later that evening; delicious.

We were in the Mission District in search of SF street food vendors, but after an hour of walking all over, we concluded that our search was unsuccessful.  On the flip side, we saw Bi-Rite Creamery and I told my friends that they're in the "8 Great Ice Cream Parlors In and Around SF" list according to Gourmet Magazine.  It was 60 degrees but there was no way I was going pass up the opportunity to try their ice cream (especially since it was one of the places that I bookmarked to try on my Yelp). We ordered the following: Cookies & Cream, Vanilla with Raspberry, Chocolate and Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle.  All of us got the kid's scoop but it was more than plenty.  And the ice cream?  It was amazing!  It was smooth and creamy; you could definitely tell the difference between freshly made ice cream to store bought ones.  I haven't had ice cream in a while (I mostly get yogurt nowadays) because I've always felt it was too heavy that gives you a bloated feeling afterwards, but Bi-Rite ice cream was pretty light... I did not feel guilty at all! Although I didn't get to have my SF street food experience, I was ecstatic finding this place.

I walked in the freezing cold with a group of friends on a late weekday evening to come try their famous salted caramel flavored ice cream featured on The Big Eat SF 7x7 list. Single scoop (1 or 2 flavors) - Salted Caramel: smooth, creamy, sweet, and a little bit salty buttery - goodness. - Toasted Coconut: I love eating coconut flavored popsicles, but this one is in a smooth and creamy form. So good with bits of shredded coconut too! I was surprised there wasn't a line when we arrived, but we beat the rush because many customers came afterward. I wanted to sample all flavors, but was limited due to the line forming behind me. The employees were very lively and energetic even during the late evening hours, plus! Their flavors are simple and not as hard to get used to as Humphry's unique flavors. But both exert high quality ice cream in their own way. They also have interesting popsicle flavors that I want to try next time  (blood orange, pineapple with mint, lime blackberry, etc. Flavors change, call for daily selection). P.S. If you can't get enough of their ice creamy goodness, they sell pints, baked goods, and ice cream cakes/pies too!

You have been warned: there usually is a line around the corner! Balsamic strawberry softserve? Creamy, smooth & not too thick. +1 for no line on the softserve & baked goods line! My boyfriend & I shared a cone w/ honey lavender, roasted banana & peach & ginger. The cone was not soggy - nice & crunchy texture. It served well w/ the ice cream. They also use additional cone layers in between scoops! The ice cream itself was worth the way... Not only did Bi-Rite have unique flavors - they were crazy delicious & they didn't leave that feeling of fattening film over your lips after having such a gluttonous snack. The place itself is cute & I like how they support SF's campaign to recycle & conserve. There's a few sit down tables. Great place overall & friendly staff.

Despite a very long line that sidewined around the building, Bi-Rite deliciously delivered to those who wait. I ordered the double scoop with three flavors of balsamic strawberry, toasted coconut, and salted caramel. All were magnificent and memorable in their own way. They were not overly sweet and lived up to their name. Chunks of toasted coconut were actually in there. The salted caramel didn't taste like corn syrup. But my personal favorite is the refreshing balsamic strawberry. I would wait in line just for that. If they had peanut butter ice cream, I could have made a pb&j combo.Service was nice and they offer samples to try. And my afternoon delight was a mere $5. So if you're in SF, stop by, bring your bffs and check out the hot gays in Castro.

I returned to Bi-Rite early last week with a couple coworkers after having dinner in the Mission. "Damn you Bi-Rite" is all I can say. I say this in part because it is on the other side of the bay from where I live and in part because it's so heavenly, rich and amazing. The flavors are precise with just the perfect mix of sweet and savory. Of course the Salted Caramel and the Balsamic Strawberry are fantastic, but I stayed away from my usual and ordered the Roasted Banana and Cherry Almond (because I love that you can order two flavors in a small ice cream) The roasted banana is absolutely perfect with an obvious fresh, not at all artificial taste of banana. The cherry almond was fantastic as well, with whole pieces of cherry and subtle flavors of amaretto or something similar. I tried the brown sugar ice cream as well (which had slight hints of ginger), but that was completely eclipsed when I tried the amazing cherry almond. The line was short when we went (about 9pm on a Wednesday). We were in and out of the store quite quickly and had time to savor our amazing ice creams as I walked back to bart and they walked back to muni to get them home. Damn you Bi-Rite. Damn you for your delicious ice cream and everything you do.

I quite like salted caramel. Okay, okay, I have an absolutely inconsolable enthrallment with salted caramel. One so unquenchable that it would cause me to drag my dining companion to Bi-Rite Creamery BEFORE dinner just to procure some salted caramel ice cream (in my defense, they close at 10:00 and our dinner reservation was at 9:30.) Upon entering the compact shop on 18th Street I was immediately taken with it - from the ice cream flavors scrawled on the outside window to the fresh baked treats that line the shelves along the wall. I tasted the goat yogurt but passed it up and chose one scoop of the salted caramel and one of the cookies and cream instead. This turned out to be a fantastically perfect combination. The woman behind me saw it, said I'd read her mind and went on to order the exact same thing. NOTES: The bowls and utensils are compostable Features Straus Family Creamery dairy products The ice cream sandwiches look amazing and next time I will get one CONCLUSION: Before dinner, after dinner, whatever the time, Bi-Rite Creamery is a must for ice cream lovers! UPDATE JAN 14, 2007: Returned for more salted caramel ice cream and this time also tried mint chip. 5 STARS for Bi-Rite Creamery!

I knew I was going to get it.. maybe not right now but sooner or later when I could make the opportunity to get a shot at fully enjoying it... I've heard of this ice cream before... and I could have enjoyed it way back when but I was too full with dinner I had just eaten. As much as I would have loved to have tried it then, it would not have been fair to me or to it to have tried to force it down. Though I did keep it close to me in my thoughts forever more. Finally the day had come that I could finally partake of the goodness that is bi-rite. I admit it had been hard to not get some earlier or along the way with merely tastings here and there. But now is the day that I can fully enjoy all that is Bi-Rite without thought of aythign else. Nothing else matters at this point. Did I mention there was NO line? Got a banana split with coffee toffee ice cream, I think maybe balsamic strawberry and possibly butter pecan. I dont know but it was all good... Great even. *drool* ;D

After dinner in the mission I decide to finally try Bi-rite Creamy and see if it is really as good as everyone says. 1st sign that is is as good as people say: I turn onto the block with Bi-Rite and think "all these people must be in line for a club" right? Nope the crowd I saw in line was actually for Bi-Rite. Really? Must be good. 2nd sign that is is as good as people say: I ask the people behind me if the line is normal for a weekend night.  They tell me the line is actually a  little light. A line at 9:30 at night for ice cream? Must be good. 3rd sign that is is as good as people say:  Once home I realized that my hand-packed mixed pint of Salted Caramel (smoky &amp; creamy), Ritual Coffee Toffee (Ben &amp; Jerry's has nothing on this) and Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel (the best of the three) was melting. So before putting it in the freezer I try a spoonful.  Half a pint later all I'm thinking is "Wow that is way better than people say!" The only miss: the toffee cookies are kinda "meh".  And while I didn't like the cookies they don't warrant one less star.

A local icon, virtually everyone from out of town requests to be taken here for a scoop or a pint of their fine ice cream. They have all sorts of unusual flavors, e.g. instead of boring strawberry ice cream, theirs is strawberry balsamic. Instead of standard caramel, theirs is salted caramel. Today I had a scoop of malted vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate pieces and it was honestly some of the best ice cream I've ever had. Do yourself a favor, stop by for a scoop or two. The line moves quickly, but if you're impatient skip the line and buy a pint.

Site of an Asian girls tussle (I managed to avoid scarring with my Muhammad Ali fancy footwork moves) when we tried to tip Amy C. for feeding our habit (ice cream) and introducing us to Honey Lavender.   You know some of us Asians will fight to the death to pay and Honey Lavender would be well worth the price.

As part of my sf adventure I went to check out this highly yelp Bi-Rite creamery. The time I went they aren't busy at all. The cashier were very attentive and offer us many samples. I immediately went for the salted caramel and honey lavender. Salted caramel was good, but honey lavender I decided to pass, personally it's weird to eat something that smell like a lotion. lol~ The cashier told us his personally favorites were the snickerdoole and the early gray tea! I got to agree with him on this one, those two I love. Esp, early gray tea. It is sweet yet not overpowering. What perfect balance. I might just find myself a new favorite ice cream. lol~ with so many selections... my friend and I end up both getting two scoop of ice cream of our choice. He made his into a make your own sundae and I got a 2 scoop. yay.. I shall be back!

Been here many a time, and will usually wait in line, but the last two times we bypassed and went straight to the freezer. First time we bought a pint of the salted caramel (my fave flavor). Second time got an ice cream sandwich with coffee toffee ice cream and some type of cookie that was delish. I would recommend doing this if you already have your favorite and are with impatient people!

Bi-Rite DREAMERY is more like it. We finally checked this place out. We found parking two blocks away. There was no line. Maybe there IS a God. Husband and I had just eaten dinner at Regent Thai and I was making the push for a quick trip over to 18th and Dolores. It doesn't take much to convince husband to indulge in dairy-free delights. He was in. On the way there, I summarized Laura B's hilarious review, told him that Frisco J raved about the ginger ice cream (I love all things ginger) and that Tania C was all about the honey lavender and roasted banana. I glanced over at husband to meet his blank stare. He thinks I'm crazy hooked on Yelp. He's right. Well, that all changed once he tasted the magic of their soy chocolate ice cream. He'll be givin' thanks to Yelp Vegan Goddess Laura B for a long, long time! As for me, I had a scoop of ginger and a scoop of roasted banana in a small cup. My only regret is that I didn't get a large! I'll say it. This place is better than Maggie Mudd. It's better than Mitchell's. The texture and flavors are out of control. And it's just so freakin' adorable in there! P.S. They also have some serious baked goods in there. By serious, I mean they look insanely decadent, delicious, and perfect.

This is definitely my favorite ice cream place in SF. There are so many unique flavors to choose from that are mostly good. I would not recommend getting their soft serve here, because this place is known for their ice cream. Everyone recommend the salted caramel ice cream, which is not a bad choice at all. However, my favorite is their roasted banana ice cream which tastes like fresh bananas, none of this artificial flavor business. This is definitely a great place to go to, just expect to be waiting in a line most of the time.

Of course I had to go to the legendary Bi-Rite Creamery my first night in town.  I wasn't sure I'd be able to try anything other than sorbet (boring!) since I'm lactose intolerant, so I practically jumped for joy when I saw they had a non-dairy ice cream option. The vegan chocolate coconut tasted like it was made from coconut milk and was nice and creamy.  Very delicious.  What a treat to get two scoops on a sugar cone and walk around the Mission district. Sure, I didn't get to sample the legendary salted caramel or the many other flavors of ice cream Bi-Rite is famous for, but I was very impressed with the one option I could eat.  Hooray for non-dairy dessert!

I have low blood pressure, so my doctor encourages me to add more salt to my diet. Do you think that salted caramel ice cream counts? For those of you with high blood pressure, try the roasted banana. Bi-Rite is just what the doctor ordered, no matter what the ailment.

There has to be a real good reason for me to venture into the Mish because parking is abhorrent.  But, vocalizing "Gladys, Gladys, Gladys" must've helped as we found parking in front of Delores Park with 2 ambulances parked in front of us with the paramedics next to their vehicles.  Never know if you should need medical help.  We were only one block from Bi-Rite.  As for Gladys?  St. Gladys is the patron saint of parking, who'd guess?  My co-worker, Gladys, tells me she never has trouble finding parking..... I love the fact that they use organic dairy products from Straus Creamery in Marin.  Their milk is sooo good and needless to say, the ice cream here is fabulous and not overly sweet compared to Haagen-Dazs.  Still, at $7 for a pint of organic ice cream, it's hard to swallow when you can get 2 pints of HD for $7 at your local Safeway on sale. A small ice cream in cup or cone costs a tad over $3 and you can get 1-2 flavors.  I got a sm scoop of toasted coconut (nice toasty flavor) and vanilla (had bits of vanilla bean in it), both were very good. Hubs had the choc coconut (OK) but his vanilla malt was excellent with bits of nuts in it.  I'd consider buying a pint of that, it was like eating a vanilla milkshake.  The ice cream was worth the trip into the Mish.  Yum.

Bi-Rite and Humphry: it's just so hard to play favorites, I love you both!  But Bi-Rite often wins out simply based on location.   By now I've tried half a dozen flavors, but the Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl always seems to lift my day and make everything better, if just for awhile.  Which is exactly what an amazingly good scoop of ice cream is supposed to do.   Five stars, Bi-Rite, for a job well done.

Some friends and I came to Bi-Rite yesterday after an afternoon of sitting in the park talking about, genuinely, nothing.  I felt like I was in a Seinfeld episode.  But it could not have been a better time. We waited in line to place our orders, once up to the front of the queue I was met with a very friendly server behind the counter.  She asked me what I would like and I told her "something with spice." She pulled out a few spoons and gave me samples of the ginger and the ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodle bits).  I was in love after sampling the two and got a scoop of each on a cone.  It was the best $4.25 I'd spent all day! I recommend and would definitely return.

Thanks to Anthony N's recommendation, I finally was able to try Bi-Rite.  Was in the city to pick up some goodies to take back home and made it a point to swing on by.  Let me start by saying that I hate parking here.  I circled around for a good 20 minutes before finding a spot.  Each time I spotted someone leaving, there was someone that snagged the spot within seconds before I could turn on my blinker.  However, in the end I was able to score a spot 10 yards from the front of the entrance (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…).  Bi-Rite has seating both inside and out for their patrons.  All of the tables were filled inside and luckily it was warm enough to enjoy their ice cream outside.   Only a few people in front (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) which gave me time to figure out what flavors I wanted to try (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…). In the end, we ordered several flavors to try (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…): Roasted banana Earl grey Honey lavender Salted caramel Ricanelas Malted vanilla w/ peanut brillte and milk chocolate All were tasty and wished I was able to bring some home.  Next time I'll find some dry ice so that I can savour their ice cream down in Socal.

After having some real nasty BBQ at Big Nate's i needed something to wash that nasty taste out of my mouth. So i remember reading about bi-rite creamery and i wanted to see what all the hype was about. Parking was a bitch, couldn't find any after 4 rounds around the block. So me and my cousin just got dropped off in front while my brother drove around again. They had alot of crazy flavors, i choose the salted carmel. My cousin looked at me real funny when i got that flavor cause it didn't sound so good to him. After i took the first spoon full my face just lit up, and he asked me how is it? I was like "this shits off the hook son" and he too had to try the salted carmel. I also tried some of the chocolate coconut and the ginger swirl both of those were also great. ($3.25 / single scoop in a cup) This place lives up to the hype, they make some great ice cream. But I still think i like ICI more in the eastbay. 5 Stars for Bi-Rite Creamery in SF

ohhh naked gay men... it was so good to see you as i parked to stand in line. you made my adventure in san francisco so so fun :) haha no, really. that was the most surprising event of my entire trip. this place has a line out the door with directions on where to stand so that you don't block traffic. luckily, the line goes REALLY fast, so we were there in no time :) for one adult scoop, you get two flavors. so i went with the most recommended: salty caramel, and also got the ginger because i freaking LOVE ginger. i want to LOVE the salty caramel. it was seriously so creamy and didn't melt the instant your hand heat touched the cup. it was nice and cold and had a really nice sticky consistency. BUT... it was just TOO sweet for me. you know when you have a whole chunk of honey or something and you swallow it and your throat feels crazy afterwards from the over-sweet taste? that's how i felt. but it was still yummy :) the ginger was PERFECT. just enough ginger taste without giving too much heat so that you could ENJOY it. in addition.. everyone working there seemed really nice... except for our lady. i think she was just tired or something. it was really short and unsmiling service, but whatever. it's icecream. get it, and move on. next... on to the market ;)

It was freezing outside but after hearing and reading all the rave reviews, I knew I had to try their ice cream! This is not to be confused with the Bi-Rite market that's on the same street only a couple blocks down! My friends and I originally walked into the market and were a bit confused... Anyway, once you find your way into the Bi-Rite CREAMERY, you must try the SALTED CARAMEL! It is delicious! Yes, it's as good as everyone says! It's the perfect combination of sweet and salty, the 2 kinds of flavors my tastebuds are constantly craving. I also tried the Honey Lavender which was also yummy but I didn't quite fall in love with that one. But I'm not a huge lavender fan to begin with either. But the name of the flavor explains it all. Think lavender with a hint of sweetness. My friends also got the Brown Sugar and the Snickerdoodle flavors which were also sweet and delicious and tasted exactlyyy like their names. If you're in SF and in Mission, this place is a MUST-TRY!!

Love how I never "plan" on coming to Bi-Rite but, since "I'm in the area," I should go....and by "area," I mean 8 blocks away. They have olive oil flavor now, which my homegirls swear by! This time around I had the brown sugar with ginger and caramel swirl. TO-DIE! Next time, I need to samps their cinnamon with snickerdoodles!

Oh. My. God.  I'll pay it.  Whatever amount you ask of me, I will cheerfully pay it.  I have been spoiled for Ben & Jerry.  Forever.  For I have partaken of the nectar that is salted caramel ice cream and it is to die for.  I got a double scoop and it was half eaten by the time I paid, waited for the girl to retrieve my snazzy new t-shirt, and got back to the car.  It is that good.  And not only is it supremely delicious, but they keep it at a perfect temperature and consistency.  You know how sometimes you stick ice cream in the microwave to soften up just the teensiest bit?  What?  No one else does that?  Hmm.  Okay, carrying on.  Bi-Rite's consistency is spot-on. Next time I will get a ginormous sundae with the salted caramel ice cream and caramel sauce and pecans and whipped cream and instead of a spoon I will eat it with one of their amazing toffee chip cookies and then I will die happy.  The end.

1341 reviews and 4.5 stars? That is ABSURD I tell you!!!  I know Yelp started in the Bay Area and all, but I seriously feel like a repetitive little peon.  You don't really need me to tell you just how good this is. It wasn't busy at all when I went on a Thursday night.  I guess it was pretty cold.  It's pretty much a buy-and-leave kinda place because there are only three stools with a little bit of counter space.  If it's not busy then you can stand inside a bit for extra warmth.  I tried the following flavors: Salted Caramel (perfect!) Coffee Toffee (big toffee bits) Cookies 'n Cream (cookies are soooo soft!) Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirls (very unique and light!) I chose the single scoop ($3.25) over the kids size ($2.25) for the sole fact that you can get one more flavor, but it was too much for me especially having had dinner right before.  The ice cream itself really has a homemade quality to it and I love how all the ingredients are local and organic.  Go SF!  They even have vegan flavors which taste close to the real thing.     There are few "regular" flavors served here and I'm glad.  It's nice to have something different, plus each one contains so many elements it's like a party in your mouth.  It makes me wonder if those old fashioned parlors with your familiar flavors will survive.  Now the Asian dude helping us has a very friendly vibe.  Some people came in and they didn't know what flavors to choose so he said "it's like your first year in college; just try it out and you'll find yourself later on."

Oh Bi-Rite Creamery, after being an established Pharmaceutical/Local Supermarket for many of those in this side of the Mission. Those artisan flavors of yours that entice us are truly splendid on hot faux summer day (it was the middle of September for crying out loud) gone by. I came here out of pure suggestion and hype from Yelpers, Friends, and Local SF dessert lovers alike. Everywhere I go, after mentioning Mitchell's or Humphry. Bi-Rite Creamery would be a suggestion hanging on the coattails of my ice cream trek gone to an end (at least in the Bay Area). JTS and I managed, to have one free day in the final week before a long awaited departure from the old roaming grounds. As a side note parking was very tricky (and disappointing considering the outrageous citation courtesy of the Douchebag SF Parking Patrol). So be wary when trying to find a place to rest your car before you get screwed over. In any case, we went inside and like fickle minded children we couldn't decide what to get even after a few samples: -Honey Lavender (it's like honey dipped onto mellow but sweet flower on a spring day in cream form; redundant, yes but hard to explain) -Salted Caramel (A lot better than my Fleur De Lys addiction from Haagen Daz, not so much salt but the caramel was decadent) -Strawberry-Kiwi (vegan style; had no recollection on the kiwi-attribute, it was tart on the strawberry side though) -Creme Fraiche (Creme Brulee, but more butter than anything, in terms of texture and flavor) -Chocolate (was consistent in texture and taste but not an avid chocolate fan, as a standalone) So what we ended up ordering were the following: -1 Double Scoop on an Ice Cream Cone: Cookies and Cream and Chocolate for JTS -1 Double Scoop on an Ice Cream Cone: Balsamic Strawberry and Brown Butter Pecan The Cookies and Cream and Chocolate were consistent to their contenders in the rest of the Ice Cream-dom. Smooth and creamery, with the chunks of Cookies all around the vanilla. The Chocolate, was exactly as I described it as a sample. The Balsamic Strawberry did disappoint, now I'm no condiment whore on my salads. But Balsamic should have a hint of sour flavor when blended with anything (maybe somewhat dominant in a lot of aspects). But the strawberry was a bit overwhelming for that sour taste, and therefore voided in the creamery confines of the cone. It was as if, I tried only a strawberry scoop without the bits of strawberry chunks. Lastly, the Brown Butter Pecan, was on point. Pecan bits were definitely in full effect, and kind of reminiscent of Scoops' (Los Angeles, Ca.) take on "Brown Bread" for flavor and texture contrast in combination. Overall, we spent about $12.00 plus tax (no tip necessary). As my final conclusion of this trip, Bi-Rite came at a close second, to Humphry only due to less "unorthodox and more on the conventional flavors." Becoming a more avid gourmet, I feel the need to try stuff that's a bit more "out of the box." Therefore on the spectrum of Ice Creams in SF would be as follows: Mitchell's For the Tradition, Bi-Rite for the Medium, and Humphry for the Adventurous (more of my preference all thanks to their Secret Breakfast). Thanks for bearing with my delay on this series of reviews, folks! Now is time to play catch up, to inform you all on of the other food spots I've scoured, cheers!

[Featured:  Best Thing I Ever Ate, Sugar Rush Episode, Food Network] Best Ice Cream I've had Period. Okay, not period.  I want to say more.   I first saw Bi-Rite when it was featured on the Food Network on a show called, "The Best Thing I Ever Ate."   They featured the SAM'S SUNDAE: chocolate ice cream with organic bergamot olive oil, maldon sea salt and hand-whipped cream.  That's right, ice cream with olive oil and salt!  The olive oil has a citrus flavor.  Mix that in with the sweetness of the chocolate ice cream, the salty sea salt...and the smoothness of the whipped cream...amazing, simply amazing.  I just learned that this place was also featured in the NY Times, Forbes, GQ, and Bon Appetit.   Luckily, I went there with three other friends and we decided to maximize the experience by going family-style.  Everything was awesome.   We all knew about the famed salted-caramel.  That lived up to the hype.  I fell in love with the Roasted Banana.  Then again, the Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces was damn good too.  Argh.  So confusing, I love them all.   I love this place.  I love their mission statement, their history, their commitment to local, organic, and sustainable ingredients.  Also, I'm a big fan of Straus Family Creamery.  My 19 month old loves Straus.  Anyway, they are the first ice cream shop in San Francisco to use Strauss Family Farms organic dairy in their ice cream.  Cool, eh?   In sum, what a great night:  dinner at Spork (review forthcoming) + ice cream at Bi-Rite + chilaxin at Dolores Park.  Thank you Bi-Rite, you are totally awesome.

Holy Crap...this place is addicting!  I definitely do not need to live near here because no matter how long the line is behind that red velvet rope, I seem to find myself standing in it with the masses to get my hands on possibly the best ice cream on this planet. The ice cream isn't just good...it's AMAZING.  Seriously it's the stuff that makes babies and cures cancer...truly life changing.  My favorite is the Salted Caramel.  I like to switch it up sometimes and mix it with a scoop of Chocolate or maybe add a fresh baked chocolate chip cookie.   I hear some of the other flavors are good, but once I have a favorite...it's difficult for me to try something else.  The staff is incredible and one of the guys remembered me coming in four times in one week! If you have never been...this should be on your list of things to do in San Francisco!

I was very excited for this place to open... I stop in, try to buy some ice cream but they dont accept debit cards for under $10.00. I came back and got 2 scoops witha tiny drizzle of Hot fudge sauce (which is not hot by the way) and it was 3.50. The pint of ice cream i got to make it over 10 dollars had to be 9 bucks, because my total was 13.00. To me this doesn't seem worth it. Yes, the ice cream is tasty, but the price and the whole vibe is off the mark. I feel that when they get the wrinkles ironed out it could turn into a good spot for a quick scoop. Till then, ill pass. Pro's: Ice Cream is tasty, organic and its close. Cons: Price are redic, hot fudge is weak and its a bit snobby... __________________________________________________­__ Second Chance review: I am officially over this "ice ceam"shop... Normally I would abide byt he "if you don't have anything good to say..." rule, but I just think this place is honestly a mediocre at best frozen milk shop.   Honestly, it's way too expensive, the wooden spoons they gave you have more taste than the "Ice Cream" and the whole bandwagon-ness of it take all the fun out of what is traditionally a great time. This "ice cream" shop gives real ice cream places a bad name. Sadly I don't see it closing anytime soon. OVER IT! ________________________________ Third Chance review: Still sucks...

Now I know what people are talking about. That honey lavender Ice cream was delicious. This place is like a boutique creamery or whatever. Uniqueness is what it strives for, i guess. Of course, like almost all of sf... no plastic.... so disappointing, especially when the ice cream is as pricey as it is. I can buy 2 cartons of ice cream with the price I paid for 2 scoops. It's good, but I don't think it's something I would regularly pay for. Dreyer's can still make me feel the same way, if not better.

Bi-rite is anything but "rite" for my waistline. Dolores Park, the amazingly friendly workers, and the Mission sun just make the hour commute to the shop that much more worth it. Did I mention the amazingly friendly workers? One time, I stuck out my tongue with such great fervor that I knocked off my top scoop of meyer lemon. To my surprise, I had the decency to not lick it off the floor and go back inside -- the lady smiled and whacked on an even bigger scoop for me! The best, BEST flavor would have to be earl grey -- too bad it's seasonal. Honey lavender, meyer lemon, ricanelas, green tea, and salted caramel are must-trys.

Sitting here in front of my computer like a work monkey, I suddenly had a great urge to yelp. My God. What do I yelp? What makes me feel oh-so-good. Ice cream. Ice Cream makes me scream for more ice cream. More specifically, SALTED freaking CARAMEL ice cream. What a gold mine. If I had invented Salted caramel ice cream flavor, I would patent it and charge all ice cream distributors a million dollars to sell my delicious flavored ice cream. Bi-rite made this flavor to be adored by me.

Arriving at late afternoon (4:30), I was happy to find that the line was pretty short (and moving very quickly/efficiently). I had read about the wonders of salted caramel so I drooling as the line inched forward. Luckily, they had menus that were passed down the line to help you decide just what crazy combo of flavors you wanted. You could pick two flavors for a single school, or three flavors for a double scoop. Naturally, being the ice cream fanatic I am, I went with the double, picking honey lavender, salted caramel (of course), and brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl as my flavors of choice. My boyfriend went with a single school of salted caramel and malted vanilla and his best friend chose a single scoop of salted caramel and coffee. After paying for our ice cream (which was, I think, a little over priced), we sat on the benches they had outside and enjoyed our treats... Salted caramel: not nearly as tasty as I expected - maybe my expectations were too high but it didn't blow my mind as I expected. It tasted a bit too salty and "burnt" for my taste. Honey Lavender: Good, tasted kind of like camomile tea, but I kind of got sick of that herb-y flavor after a while. Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl: MIND BLOWN - so much more delicious than I expected (I had picked it randomly since I couldn't find a 3rd flavor I really wanted but I refused to settle for just two flavors). It was just the right amount of sweet (not too intensely sugary) and the ginger flavor was subtle and perfectly complemented by the smooth caramel. I also got to try the flavors the boys got: Coffee: Tastes like coffee - nothing spectacular. Malted Vanilla: Surprisingly good, woud be great for a person who wants a simple flavor (nothing too "exotic") but doesn't want to sacrifice delicious flavors. Its a very nice, creamy, rich vanilla flavor. All in all, this was some yummy ice cream, some of the best I've had (and I'm quite the ice cream connoisseur), but it didn't live up to its sky-high expectations for me.

After having an Ike's sandwich with my friend, we decided to get some dessert. So we walked to Bi-Rite. This was my first time going here so I didn't know what to expect. My friend wanted to share so we got 3 favors, Malted Vanilla, Salted Caramel, and Roasted Banana. Wow...They were amazing. The Salted Caramel was something I've never tasted in an ice cream. It was salty but since I'm filipino, I loved it! But I preferred the Roasted Banana. It was so good. I will most def come back again.

Oh my lord. Roasted Banana Ice Cream is friggin' *AWESOME*. It hurts it's so good. I wanted a third before I even had a second. I've vowed to go to the gym for an extra 20 minutes a day just so I can eat more of their ice cream. It has been less than 8 hours since I tasted the magnificence that is Bi-Rite and I'm already having day dreams about it.

Prime location across the street from SF's best small park (Dolores), and walking distance from all that is great in the Mission, Bi-Rite Creamery is perhaps the best-located and best tasting Ice Cream Shop in all of the Bay Area. The obnoxiously long lines are worth the wait and all the hype, as Bi-Rite provides great flavor selections that are well balanced and put a smile on the face and hearts of all its patrons. People will swear by the played out and over used Salt Caramel, but I would recommend you try many of the other worthy flavor offerings.   Bi-Rite serves the most well rounded ice cream around, providing a nice balance of flavor, consistency, and creaminess.             I would call this place flawless, but I feel that the ice cream is served at too low of a temperature and usually wait a few moments to allow the ice cream to soften up a bit. The flavor rotation is a bit weak and too safe at times, but why take risks when you don't have to.  These people know exactly what they are doing and need not deviate from their successful formula.   But other than that, Bi-Rite is a definite stop on the Ice Cream pilgrimage and is arguably the best ice cream shop in California. Highly Recommended

Based on two separate visits, I'd say visit #1 was a 5-star experience (despite the 30 minutes wait), but visit #2 was a 1-star experience (despite the mere 10 minute wait). Both times, I ordered the Salted Caramel flavor as one of my flavors, but the flavors I got were night an day. The first time, it was mind blowing with a hint of salt and a massive slap in the face of goodness. The second batch, however, was majorly bitter. It tasted like someone had burnt caramel and then tried to convert that flavor to ice cream.

Bi-Rite needs another review like I need a hole in the head. But since I'm an attention whore, here goes my two cents... Honey Lavender -- Five stars for uniqueness, but the lavender flavor was too overwhelming. Mint Chip -- Nothing to write home about. The mint flavor was way too overpowering. It was like eating Wrigley's Double Mint Gum in ice cream form. Uh, or a sprig or two of fresh mint. Toasted Coconut -- Pretty damn yummy. Recommended. Mexican Chocolate -- My new favorite flavor. Chocolatey richness. Highly recommended. I won't gush too much about it 'cuz I want more for me. So all you hipsters standing in line, you better save some for me!

I've been here a couple times now and I always get the same thing: honey lavender and salted caramel.  Of the two, I definitely prefer the honey lavender.  YUMMY!!  The salted caramel is really good, too, but I can only take so much of its intense flavor. Would I go out of my way to the mission just to have this ice cream?  No.  Would I bother getting in line if I happened to be in the mission?  Yes.  Next time I just happen to be in the mission (which is rarely), I might want to branch out and try the other flavors.  It would probably make for a more comprehensive review.

5 starring and a fan not for the usual salted caramel (although it was good) but for the stellar non-dairy option. Cost to worth it rating: 3 ($3.25 for single 2 flavors) Eve award: best non-dairy ice cream Highlights: - Lactose intollerant friendly: the best dairy-free ice cream I have ever had by a mile! Most non-dairy options in grocery stores or ice cream shops taste like gum even at their best. This could go undercover as ice cream and not get found out--amazing! To make it even better, the flavor was chocolate coconut, one of my favorite desserty flavor combinations. They also have a sorbet option. - Ingredients: organic and mostly around 5 or less per flavor (beats even Breyer's). Love that! - Economically friendly: paper cups and classic wooden paddle for a spoon. - Popsicles: few flavors a day which was pretty cool. Lowlights: - Flavors of the day not listed on their website. A la Hot Doug's in Chicago, would be nice to know what's available before waiting in line. Didn't expect to jump on the bandwagon, as I don't each so much ice cream, but did love it so I'll be back to check out more non-dairy offerings.

1500+ reviews already?  Damn its a sad realization for a yelper when he hasn't already been part of that first 1000 who have unanimously voted for bi-rite's greatness.  Need I say more about the place?   And because of that, it explains why on a cool 59 F degrees Monday night at 9:30pm while Dolores Park's blazing bright field lights just beam down on 18th St illuminating the line that STILLL exists at this time of day.  Simply amazing....but not as amazing as the 3 flavors my friends and I decided to check out.  And what makes Bi-Rite great is the seating area outside that lets you enjoy the delight while people watching in the Dolores area.   We tried the following: - Salted Caramel - yes, its good....it meets the hype - Toasted Coconut - didn't know THISS one huh?  If you're as crazed on coconut as I am.....winner right here. - Balsamic Strawberry - pretty good, but doesn't seem too far from the regular taste of strawberry - Honey Lavender - I just came to a realization lavender should just stay as a color in my head, but I could see it being good to other people.

God I love ice cream. The things I will do for a good scoop of ice cream... don't get me started. Bi-rite has the taste of home. Everything is made with care, you can taste that and the quality ingredients in the ice cream. House-made toppings like hot fudge and caramel make me want to hop on a flight to San Fran right now. It's what Ben and Jerry's must have been like when it was a small shop in Vermont. Scoops are small but that's OK. So are the long lines that sometimes wrap around the block. With the park across the street, on a warm sunny day, Bi-Rite can't be beat. Oh and the selection of unique flavors will really blow your mind. Yum!

It's always good when a place lives up to the yelp reviews hype. This is one of them. My bf always raves about this place every time we're in the city but we never want to stand in line. We finally came here and barely beat the line and now I can see why this place is always so packed. We got the coffee toffee, salted caramel, and ricanelas (cinnamon). In order of my favorite it goes: coffee toffee, ricanelas, and then salted caramel. This is a little biased because I always put anything that has chocolate or coffee at the top of my list. Also, I saw a lot of bad things said about salted caramel. I'll admit that I wasn't fond of it at first but it grew on me. Plus, the name itself should serve as a warning that it's not gonna be the best thing you eat. I don't know what it is about this place. Maybe it's because it was such a nice day when we went, maybe because it's right next to a park, but the ambiance of this area makes for eating icecream outside one of the most relaxing things I've done in the city. I'll be back to try all the other flavors.

Review #517 for the establishment. Yeah, just another voice in the line wrapping around the corner! It was a nice day out. Convinced two who did not feel like moving after a large meal to walk the 4.5 blocks from 18th and Sanchez. That salted caramel is crazy good. Gimme more, gimme gimme more! Mint chip is excellent too. Absolutely love the Halloween outfits the folks behind the counter sport as they serve you some very yummy ice cream. Soft-foods/brace-faced friendly. I had the single scoop [1-2 flavors] in a cup, rather than the cone since the cone's a bit too crunchy for the teeth at the moment. Oh, but when these braces come out, I am ALL OVER those cones - they won't know what hit 'em. Buy 10 ice cream products, get a single scoop for free! Get the punch card.

Unimaginably creative & delicious flavors! I adored the Honey Lavendar + Pineapple Banana Sorbet. Sampled the following (thru a friend & samples): - Balsamic Strawberry (very intriguing) - liked - Coconut Chocolate - yummy - Cinnamon with SnickerDoodle - delicious - Coffee Toffee - very good - Salted Caramel - odd (possibly a bit too salty for me, but I'm not a big "salty' fan; I'm going to try again on my next visit) All in all, I must admit I prefer Bi-Rite Creamery to Mitchell's (sorry ice cream gods) ;)

A bit about me and ice cream: I love ice cream and eat it just about every day (in some shape or form). I appreciate everything from thick custards to intensely flavored gelatos. My husband and I recently moved to SF and are slowly trying out all the ice cream places in the city. We decided to try Bi-Rite early on because of the hype and all the fantastic reviews. We weren't super impressed. Now, don't get me wrong--it wasn't bad ice cream. It just didn't live up to the hype. The flavors were good (we had the salted caramel, balsamic strawberry, and olive oil), but not epic. We wanted the the texture to be creamier. And then when you add the really long line and challenging ordering (it was hectic, and I felt guilty tasting more than one or two flavors), it just wasn't worth it. We'll continue with our search for ice cream places we want to return to.

Everyone hated me and I loved it. Everyone who saw me that is, because I was walking down the street with a bowlful of delicious, SCRUMTRULESCENT ice cream from Bi-Rite Creamery! I had to skip out on what I thought would be a nice walk to grab a light lunch, but was too busy to get away. Settled for Trader Joe's frozen something-or-other.  NOT HAPPY. I beat myself up at the gym for it, but secretly I was killing myself so I could be a big fat piggy face and have ice cream for dinner. WHY? Because it reached 90 degrees on a ridiculously gorgeous day in May in San Francisco and I was trapped in a concrete jail, yearning to make a 'lil vitamin D, and I got denied. I pitied myself to the point of self-indulgence and that's what I did. And it was all that I hoped for.... and then some. while waiting in line I was recognized by staff as a patron at another establishment I Yelped (she wasn't too pleased with it- that's the nature of honesty), but that didn't slow me down from thinking about which flavor combination I would get. The winners? Salted caramel and balsamic strawberry. I had no idea how these flavors would mingle on my tongue, much less my bowl, but it seems you can't really go wrong with any combo here. The salted caramel flavor was reminiscent of the caramelized sugar atop creme brulee rather than your typical and traditional concept of caramel, but this was caramelized sugar done right. I didn't get much in the sense of salted, but there most certainly wasn't any of the nasty burnt or tinny flavor of a poorly executed melted sugar crust. The taste was so interesting in the form of ice cream that in the words of my boyfriend, I had to keep the spoonfuls coming to my mouth like a conveyor belt lest "I lose the flavor! There will be a flavor deficiency in my mouth!" The balsamic strawberry was delicious too- a fairly good, strong fresh strawberry flavor that once in the mouth, was tamed and teased by a veil of balsamic vinegar. The flavor combination has always been a favorite- especially saba and strawberries, and to materialize it in an ice cream is pure genius. Contrary to another reviewer, I didn't think the ice creams were too light and airy. My ice cream stayed fairly solid from Noe Valley all the way to the first half of the Bay Bridge with minor meltage and that wouldn't have happened with a lighter consistency. What pleasantly surprised me was the fact that it didn't seem too sweet, and it was definitely rich and every bite was delicious. The line moved fast enough and the counter staff were friendly, even though they were stuck behind a counter with a bunch of hot fans trying to keep our ice cream cool. The shelves leading up to the counter were lined with artisan chocolate bars and housemade cookies, books on Tartine and cupcakery, and a cooler at the end held prepacked pints and cookie dough, although on a day like that, everyone's focus was on scoops. I felt a little guilty as I scraped the last morsel of my double scoop from it's biodegradeable bowl, but not too much!

The last time I had soft serve was a twisted cone at McD's...circa 1999. So you may imagine that my eyes were bright with anticipation, my lips were breaking into a smile and that I was practically begging by the time I made it through the line and to the take out window-- GIVE IT TO ME... salted caramel and chocolate twist that is.

I have to say I was pretty disappointed in Bi-Rite after my first experience.  I do want to say the staff was awesome. Ready to serve samples and answer questions all with a cheery smile on their face. 5 stars for the staff for sure. I'm an ice cream snob and hailing from the midwest I am picky about my dairy. I think Bi-Rite is one of those places you think is great if you haven't had insane amounts of ice cream like me. Or if you live close and its your only option. Why only 2 stars? Their famed version of Salted Carmel was the worst rendition of the flavor I have ever had. I actually could not finish it I thought it was that bad. It could have been a bad batch but I don't know. Throwing away ice cream is a bad sign. I could not get my ice cream on a cone. What? Well I could have but the staff told me I could only get one tiny small scoop because their ice cream won't hold up in a cone. Total BS. At least 2 scoops on a sugar cone is my typical order - to not be able to have this was just wrong. I also ordered a scoop of the Ricanelas and it had a very icy consistency. The flavors just seemed off again. Another disappointment. I sampled the Honey Lavender and it was like drinking my shampoo. There is a way to use flower essence in ice cream but it should not be so overpowering. I also tried the Coffee Toffee and it just didn't work for me. My favorite ice cream is Jeni's in Ohio. Until I find ice cream I love in the bay area I guess I'll keep ordering online. http://www.jenisicecream… peace, love, and good booze ~ chase

Bi-Rite Creamery is right across the street from my damn house. My gut is going nowhere. First of all miss creamery woman, do not let us try everything. Oh man. I resisted with all of my might. Are you trying to kill me? And everything in this place is organic. She told us so. Like a dozen times. I swear she convinced us the counter was organic. Great. Now I feel better about stuffing my face with ice cream. I went with chocolate. Boring? Maybe. But like I said, I LIVE ACROSS THE STREET. I'll be back. I have to say, it was one of the best chocolate cones I've had in awhile. Man. Admittedly, it did seem a tad spendy, but it IS Bi-Rite. They don't skimp. And when we first approaced it, the place looked closed. Seems like they could use some better lighting. Although their selection won't be as big, I predict they'll give Mitchell's a little run for their money...

Today was one of those rare super warm San Francisco days - perfect for ice cream, even though we stuffed ourselves with brunch. It actually worked out to our advantage - made the wait more pleasant basking in the summer sun, deciding which of the *18* mouth-watering flavors to try.  Would be great if they had a 'Bi-Rite sampler' on the menu - lil' melon ball scoops of heaven.   I ended up choosing the Coffee Toffee and the Brown Butter Pecan, both were delicious - but the Brown Butter was palate blowing!  I'd go back for an extra large scoop of that next time (which hopefully will be soon). I also purchased a pack of chocolate chip cookies - they are scrumptious - soft, fresh, and milk-chocolaty. Definitely worth waiting in line for.  Who knows, you might even make a new friend.

Omg.. this must be the best ice cream I ever had!!!! Even the melted toffee chocolate chips cookie was so good!!  Their ice cream is nicely done, full of flavor, creamy, just the right amount on the mixture.   You can't even get sick of it after a pint of them.  B/c it's San Francisco, they let you taste the ice cream with real spoon (being green), which was pretty interesting. Honey Lavender - superb!!! I felt like I fall in love w/ it. Salted Carmel - a tab too sweet but it was still good Roasted Coconuts - yum yum yum... It's a little bit toward the expensive side consider how little ice cream they give you.  I had three flavor in a double cup bowl for $4.75.  Hey but I would come back again and again just b/c it taste sooo good...

With 3,000+ shining reviews on its back, there's really not much to be said from me in this dinky little review box at this point, in terms of any tips or experiences that stand out amongst the rest. So, in an attempt to be succinct (for once. I know, I know): - They DO take card here, which is glorious in the Mission. - Try as many samples as you can. What makes Bi-Rite stand out amongst any other ice cream shoppe are its unique, richly crafted flavors and amazing textures. (Salted caramel, roasted banana, coffee toffee, and the white chocolate w/raspberry swirl are some of my favorites. Honey lavender is a big hit for my friends, so try that if you're a lavender fan.) - Don't fret if you see the/a line. It moves fairly quickly. The workers know what's up. I mean . . . they work at Bi-Rite. - If you happen to be wandering the area, hanging out at Dolores Park or just in the Mission in general on a rare, warm San Francisco day, this place is NECESSARY (but also, refer back to the third point). Lastly, it is totally moot that/if you're not an ice cream fan. This isn't ice cream, it's Bi-Rite. Love.

Salted Caramel + Earl Grey combo is on HIT. The Salted Caramel was a little bit too sweet for my taste (but nonetheness AMAZING)... however, mixing it w/ the Earl Grey (which was much lighter) was the perfect combo for me!

Yeah, it's really good ice cream: creamy with rich flavor.  I had the salted caramel and it is good but not worth the line or the price.  You are going to give me more than that, Bi-Rite, if you expect me to stand in a ridiculously long line with kids and hipsters on a sunny day again. It is so ridiculous--here and at Ritual on weekends.  Wake up, kiddies, unless they are infusing the product with some *serious* addictive substances, there is no need to stand in a line reminiscent of a communist-era Soviet breadline.

Even after hearing all of the hype, Bi-Rite still Z0MG-ified my taste buds.   Honestly, every scoop was a taste of heaven.  Each bite of lavender honey was like a mini trip through the fields of Provence. The Orange Cardamom evoked my fondest memories of homemade Kulfi... and the Vanilla, was -really- VANILLA.  There was nothing plain about it. If you really want a kick in the taste buds, also try the salted caramel. EASY FIVE STARS!

OK, after mentioned Bi-Rite Creamery within my Bakesale Betty review, it was time to make the trip to SF and try it out.   Actually, I was already at Fort Baker in Marin at 7:30 AM to cheer Gayle on during her Susan G. Komen Walk for the Cure.  So after I saw Gayle (and who was pleasantly surprised to see me), I headed into the City.  That added up to $9 in Fast Trak tolls over the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge and the GG Bridge. Of course I puttered around first.  I took my own sweet time on Union Street and the Marina and then Japan Town and the Fillmore before walking to the Bi-Rite from where my car was parked in the Castro.  The day was hot and the fog had not yet saved the day.  There was also a Block 18 party going on. For all the exemplary Yelp press, I was surprised how small and unassuming this place was.  And there was no line!  And contrary to Lisa N.'s experience, I found the the staff service to be very sincere and friendly. I ordered a combination of chocolate and the banana ice cream.  The chocolate was excellent and the banana was good, but not especially noteworthy.  But, it did take the edge off that Indian roll I had at Kasa for lunch! And I'll need to come back to try all those other cool sandwiches and maybe even take a pint home to eat after my Bakesale Betty's chicken sandwich. Life IS good.....

There's already over 1600 reviews so I don't think mine will make a huge difference... If there is a place with a line around the corner for ice cream on a cold and windy day, then the ice cream must be good.   If there are over 1600+ reviews for an ice cream spot, then the ice cream must be good.  (You can't really have 1600 negative reviews and still be open can you?) That pretty much sums it up.

Talk about overhyped and overrated.  Wait I forgot another "over" description...overpriced.   I did not enjoy a single part of my experience here.  First of all, the pints are $8!!!  That's the same price for a half gallon at Mitchells.  Speaking of which, Mitchells is far superior in every way to Bi-Rite.  (Hipsters will flock to Bi-Rite because of moronic flavor combos such as Strawberry Balsamic.)  I actually tried the Strawberry Balsamic.  It was horrible.  Really horrible.  Then we just ordered some of the Salted Caramel.  Also horrible.  The other pint we ordered was Cookies N Cream.  Let's talk about some false advertising.  It's actually coffee ice cream, not vanilla.  I did not find that out until I got home and opened my overpriced pint.  That really, really, really pissed me off.  They should have labelled it Cookies N Coffee.  I would love to get my money back.  For what we paid, I could have put a down payment on a Pac Heights mansion. The other thing that burned my chaps was the holier than thou "we're organic" attitude.  Get over yourselves.  It's ice cream for crap's sake.   Stay away from this place.  Go to Mitchells instead.  Better prices, better ice cream, and better attitude.

Until recently, I hadn't been back since my first venture two years ago; it's still as good as I remember, and there's still a line outside the door.  That says a lot. The honey lavender was my favorite on this trip.  It's solidified that their homemade ice cream is solid, but I think their more typical offerings are what make you appreciate a place like Humphry Slocombe that has flavors "outside the box", so to speak...flavors that don't sound like they should be meld together, but somehow work.

Worth the wait! Loooooooong lines. This past chilly weekend the line wasn't as bad as I imagine it usually is..maybe about 20 people in line. And it was cold out!! It was so worth the wait, which was surprisingly only about 15 minutes. Those cute little hipsters move fast! They are nice too and let you try as many flavors as you like. I had a scoop of the brown sugar which was ahhhhmazing! Drool. We also ordered pre-packed pints of malted vanilla with peanut brittle, brown butter pecan & ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles) - TO DIE FOR!! omg..one of the best ice creams I've EVER had!! Super creamy w/big delicious chunks of snickerdoodle cookie batter. The one disappointing pint was the meyer lemon. The flavor was actually pretty good, but it had a very strange texture..almost like it was dried out and not creamy at all. So maybe we got a bad pint or something. Avoid the insane lines by going when it's cold out and taking a pint to enjoy at home. Another tip is that you don't have to wait in line at all if you are JUST getting pre-packed pints, but hey you drove all the way there, you might as well try some flavors!

I'm probably the only one in San Francisco who has never been here before.  I'm probably the only one in all of the Bay Area who has never been here.  Yes I'm ashamed.  Even my baby has been here before me. It's wildly popular and a bit pricey for ice cream.  But when you're craving it, you just get it and shut your mouth and take a bite.   I sent my husband on a hunt for ice cream since he was in the neighborhood and boy am I glad he went.  He got the salted caramel pint to bring home to the wifey.  We strategically ate the ice cream so that it would last forever - meaning two tablespoons a day per person and that was it.  He finally gave in.  "I can't take it anymore!  I need more than two spoons!  I gotta have it!"  Fine.  Pint gone. Somehow for Valentine's Day, my husband snuck over there and secretly hid two pints of ice cream in our freezer at home, another salted caramel and honey lavender.  Mind you, I don't cook and obviously didn't look in the freezer.  He hid those pints under a pile o' frozen food in the freezer for a whole week before he had to show me where it was.  Mmm... salted caramel... mmm... honey lavender.  Now, he hated the honey lavender because he said it just tasted like potpourri.  I actually really liked it. This time, I let him dive right in.  Okay, 3 bites per day.  Deal. I still have yet to come here and I even earned a free gift card to go here so now it's a MUST GO.  I will also learn from my friend's mistake and avoid a $400 Bi-Rite ice cream trip and not get my car towed when desperate for the good stuff.

This place is not expensive. In fact, for the lowest tier price, you can get two flavors :) The servers are also not stingy about trying out their flavors at all. They handed me lots of samples on metal spoons that they later washed themselves. Love the green-ness of it all. In conclusion... this is just a place you have to try for yourself! Yes, you do have to wait in a line outside as though you are trying to get into an exclusive nightclub. But the flavors are really interesting and delicious, the texture of the ice cream is thick and creamy, and the prices are decent. If you like ice cream, there is no reason for you not to come here and try it :)

Ice cream is worth the long lines and wait at Bi-Rite Creamery! Bi-Rite offers an eff-ton of unique flavors I've never seen anywhere else. Best part, the counter help is totally cool with you sampling many flavors... they even encouraged me to try different flavors I didn't ask! (Also, props for using metal spoons and reducing waste). Bi-Rite is quality over quantity. The serving sizes are normal. A single scoop really is a single scoop. A double is two. In my opinion, this is so much better than getting a huge portion of uninspired, blah ice cream. I sampled the honey lavender and ricenalas (cinnamon with snickerdoodle), and ordered pumpkin and malted vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate pieces. The honey lavender and ricenalas were true standouts. Really unique! If you're into herbal and natural flavors, get the honey lavender! The malted vanilla with PB brittle and chocolate wasn't as unique as other options, but reminded me of a gourmet version of Ben and Jerry's. The pumpkin was a good seasonal choice, but wasn't exemplary. The toppings at Bi-Rite are so unique- I had to try the homemade graham crackers! They weren't very sugary, which was nice. More of a toasted flavor with a nice crunch. Highly recommend it! So wait in line, because it's worth the unlimited samples and some of the best ice cream around!

Arrived there at 10:45 to a closed shop...or so I thought.   ..."Sir...can you please just let us in.  We came all the way from So Cal and took a $20 cab ride just to come here to try this spot.  You gotta help us" ..."uhm miss, the ice cream shop's that way". ..."oh" Lesson learned, leave your visine tears and sob story at home, and head to the ice cream shop on the corner and not the market just a couple of shops away. We ordered: Salted Caramel (4 STARS) Honey Lavendar (5 STARS) Roasted Banana (4.5 STARS if you like banana) While I liked Salted Caramel, it only took like 5 spoonfuls before it got too sweet for me.  Also, I just came back from Phoenix not too long ago and had ice cream topped with salted caramel and chocolate covered cornuts from Postino, so it's pretty hard to top that =D With that said, honey lavendar FTW.  There's something to be said about subtle sweetness that makes it so delicious.  You know what this reminded me of?  Chrysanthemum tea.  It's as though this is what Chrysanthemum Tea Ice Cream would be if they put it in ice cream form.  500 points for tasting like one of my all time favorite drinks.

Loved the homemade whipped cream, LOVED the fresh fudge, love the bittersweet chocolate chunks & the coffee toffee was surprisingly not too sweet!  Now for the one everyone talks about, salty caramel, maybe it was flavor overload from the other stuff but it was bland to me. I got a make-ur-own sundae but I felt it was higher priced (7) than if u had just went for the 2 scoops + 1 topping, 1 sauce, 1 whipped cream(3.5+.75/topping=5.75).. My sundae was pretty big & filling so maybe that's why it costs more. My bf's brown butter pecan had delicious pieces of nuts that almost melted like butter but were maybe too mushy. The plain vanilla was delicious & u could tell it was made with fresh vanilla beans. Trying to find a place in NYC that's similar but haven't! Any one know of any???

After many months of BRC being in my bookmarks, I was so giddy that I had to be reminded to stay in line and order when my turn came.  I tried 3 flavors - the malt, burnt banana, and balsamic strawberry.  So hard to decide!!! Anyway, got the banana split with my bf - with balsamic strawberry and malt scoops.  The bananas were carmelized with a torch.  Crunchy caramel coating with chocolate fudge strips hardened onto the ice cream.  Heavenly. Can't wait to return and try the other flavors.  Ooh la la!

I JUST went there for the first time today.... Perfect sunny weather, and it's about two blocks away from a restaurant I'm interviewing with... I had a great interview, and decided that I would celebrate with a delicious double-scoop of ice cream. I tried a vanilla/honey lavender combination, and OH MY GOD. It was perfect. Like toe-curling, mouth-watering, "I'm so excited I feel like I just had sex" perfect. A veritable oral orgasm (NOT the dirty kind! Come on now!) I'm now hoping I get the job I interviewed for for the simple reason of its proximity to Bi-Rite, so I'll have an "excuse" to visit frequently. :D

Came here at 9pm tonight and the I couldn't believe the line went around the corner! I almost thought my friends took me to a nightclub as a joke but nope it was this place. The line moved quickly which was a pleasant surprise and it gave me plenty of time to agonize over which flavor to get. I ended up getting a triple scoop with 1.coffee toffee =winner 2. Malted Vanilla with peanut brittle=winner 3. Ricanelas:vanilla with cinnamon ice cream and snickerdoodle cookie bits mixed in. =hat trick! Every single flavor in the place is good....seriously addictive and potentially illegal if your dieting.

You scream. I scream. We all scream for ice cream!!! And if it's Bi-rite's, we really all will be! Hands down one of the best ice cream places I have ever been to. For once, you can believe all the hype. They have super unique flavors that you probably won't be able to find anywhere else. My favorites are the infamous salted caramel and the earl grey tea. Their cookies 'n' cream is hecka good too. Blows dreyers...and breyers...out of the water. The flavors are just so rich and the texture so creamy. Regardless of the time or the weather conditions, there seems to always be a line here. On hot SF nights, the line is out the door and around the corner.  If it weren't for the masses of people waiting behind me, I would probably test out every flavor when it's my turn to order. Parking can take quite a while and waiting in line can take even longer, but I still think it's worth it. Even in the chilly winter weather, I'd still be down to get myself a cup of Bi-Rite ice cream. Therefore, I am forced to give this place nothing less than 5 stars!

Is the unattainable really more desirable? If so, Bi-Rite is the unattainable to me. I'm rarely in the Mission district. And when I am, it's never a good time. I'm either: on my way to eat; too full for ice cream (i know it's unimaginable! but it happens); or heading in a different direction. When the opportunity does come, its always moments before the store closes. So once again, Marti mad-dashes her way over to make it before 11pm. 11:02pm. Darn! Luckily, there were a bunch of fatties...i mean...Bi-Rite lovers still inside eating their ice cream. It was a cold windy night. And the sight of a dozen people huddling in that tiny store enjoying their treat in those tiny bowls just planted a fat smile on my face. I always get a scoop of Salted Caramel. Then rotate flavors as my second scoop. This time I tried Malted Vanilla: chocolate bits and peanut brittle. Creamy ice cream with suprising bits and bursts of crunchiness and sweetness. Yummmmerz!! =)

The sixth stop on the 7x7 journey. The day was quickly becoming the evening and although I just had my Ike's Place sandwich with judicious bites of other sandwiches as well, when asked if I still wanted Bi-Rite's ice cream I enthusiastically replied, "YES!" The creamery is literally a stone's throw away from Dolores Park and so even though there was a line, we were in the store perusing the flavors in no time. Being a first timer, it was time to try some flavors and I absolutely love how they whip out the big silver spoons for tasting. After trying a myriad of flavors, we settled on Malted Vanilla (milk chocolate and peanut brittle) and Ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles) which I made the mistake of pronouncing it "Ree-CANE-las" when it should be "Ree-canelas." You can bet I felt a little stupid/ dumb and not even in the hyphy-type of stupid dumb you can get away with in the bay area. However, what wasn't dumb was the quality of ice cream you get here. It's creamy and delicious and you really get bits and pieces of brittle in the Malted Vanilla that makes for a sweet treat not to be missed. Also, the Ricanelas wasn't at all overpowering in flavor as it's cinnamony concoction would suggest. Together it was just incredible plain old-fashioned good creamy ice cream. How come a place with such cold weather gets such awesome ice cream? Not fair at all for an ice cream lover.     p.s. Coffee Toffee isn't that bad either...but it has a strong coffee flavor while still retaining a lot of sweetness.

Their ice cream is so smooth and rich in flavor it leaves you craving more after your first taste. Unanimous opinion, Salted Caramel was our favorite. If you've never been here, you have to try Bi-Rite at least once. And everyone that knows what's up..stop holding up the lines!! - jenn

It's just so so good, you can't stop thinking about it. The salted caramel is tasty. Balsamic strawberry tastes amazing, like nothing you've ever had, and it's memorable. We went for the coffee toffee sundae with everything... delicious. What else is there to say? It's good ice cream... good enough to go out of your way for. There's pre-packed pints you can take home. They also sell cookies and brownies which I have yet to try. Not much area to sit. Just a counter with four stools and a couple of benches outside. Now that I think about it... Walking around dolores park + ice cream = working off some calories (less guilt?)

It was a bad day. I left work. I went to Dolores Park. I got drunk there, and I cried there, all by myself. Then I walked to Bi-Rite Creamery for the first time in my life and got a child sized cone of salted caramel ice cream. The second the full weight of the flavors hit my tongue I momentarily moaned. Soon that glorious cone was all I could think about, and as I sat there in the sunshine, licking what heaven must taste like, I knew this place had saved the day.

We all know that ice cream makes everyone happy, but is it worth trying to find parking and waiting in line on a chilly evening for that happiness? If it's Bi-Rite in SF, that would be a resounding yes. This was probably one of the best ice cream cones I've had in a long, long time. This is one hole-in-a-wall where I definitely would not know about if it weren't for Yelp or friends. You see a line out the door, and with the red velvet ropes, you would think people were waiting to get inside some club. Happily, it's for ice cream, there are no annoying bouncers, and the line moves relatively fast. All the flavors look so good, and the distinct names probably have a lot to do with it. Balsamic strawberry, snickerdoodle, creme fraiche, the list goes on. There's even a honey lavendar, which seems too exotic for me. Sounds like it would taste like body lotion. But I wish I could get a scoop of everything else. I would gladly skip a few meals and go a strict Bi-Rite ice cream diet. I go with the popular salted caramel and roasted banana on a cone. There's incredible depth in the flavors, especially with this combination. I would describe it as making s'mores, but with bananas. The other usual superlatives follow -- smooth, rich, and creamy. It has that fresh, organic, homemade quality that you just can't duplicate. My only gripe is that I thought that the scoops were rather small. Or maybe I was just enjoying the ice cream too much to realize how fast I was eating it. My cone was gone within minutes. I'm already plotting my next visit to try the other flavors. Planning a trip around ice cream? It doesn't get any better than that.

One of my favorite ice cream places.  I love supporting the local places, and they have some flavors that certain ice cream places couldn't even dream of creating.  I love how they make the ice cream on site, and use a organic egg and milk in it.  Additionally, you don't need a chemistry degree to understand what they put in, usually it's eggs, cream, milk, sugar, butter and whatever ingredient to make each flavor.  Additionally for those on special dietary restrictions they do offer some vegan friendly and lactose-free alternatives. Plenty of people have already said it, but just some of my personal favorites when I'm there is the Salty Carmel, Toasted Coconut and Brown Butter Pecan ice cream.  And while the menu rotates and you do not know for sure what they are going to have on any given day, when they have all three I usually get a double scoop of ice cream and take a pint home with me.  I usually keep away during those really hot lazy dog days of summer, but sometimes the craving and the enticing flavors are to much to resist and I end up finding myself happily standing in line.   One little gripe I have is with the frequent buyer card, where if I by a cheap item like a Popsicle or something  a little more expensive like a prepacked ice cream pints, I get only one punch for it.  It's nit picky I know, but still, I wish they did something to reward us who like to hoard and take a pint home with us with our 2 scoop sundae for immediate consumption.  Still if you never tried this spot, definitely give this spot a try, it's definitely worth the wait... but if you aren't feeling patient it's OK, you'll be one less person I have to wait behind while I wait my turn.  :)

I only came to Bi-Rite creamery to see what the hype was all about. I was intrigued by the idea of an old school ice cream shop selling new school flavors. My favorite? The balsamic strawberry. Not sure where the balsamic flavor is...because all I tasted was some seriously fresh & delicious strawberry! Other flavors are the salted caramel (good but slightly too salty for my taste), coffee toffee (seriously as strong as a cup of joe), creme fraiche, and more Unlike Baskin Robbins or other chain ice cream shops, you can literally taste the freshness and quality of the ingredients. A serious thumbs up for that! Another reason this place rocks is the price! You can get a kids scoop or a single scoop (with up to 2 flavors!) for a little over $2. I'd much rather get my ice cream here than Baskin Robbins at those prices! So glad they don't overcharge! I haven't tried their soft serve, but that's next on the list! Can't wait to come back!

I am MATAKAW.  as in... hella voracious when it comes to eating! once I stepped into this place, I told my peeps that I will ask for a taste of EVERYTHING.  bakit-why?   because I want to find out if they can live up to the hype.... and I am hecka cheap. The first thing I noticed was that they used actual metal spoons for tasting, which means this place is all about being green (metal spoons are washable; their spoons and cups are made of compostable products).  I asked the lady, who was very accommodating, if I can taste their most popular flavor: SALTED CARAMEL.  ohhh dayngg hella good!   alright... how about another flavor?   she gave me the COFFEE-TOFFEE.  ooooh mmmm... oohhh yeah.....   how about another flavor?.... she let me try the ORANGE CARDAMOM. wow.  I didn't think I'd like cardamom (I used to distill the oils of this crap in my organic chemistry lab) but it worked well with the orange! My taste buds were still craving for some of the SALTED CARAMEL, so I ordered a scoop of that and a scoop of the coffee-toffee (i love coffee and toffee).

The ice cream here is pretty good, and the workers are really good about letting you sample flavors.  The best part about the Bi-Rite Creamery experience, however, is the sugar cones.  I'm normally a waffle-cone person myself, but these sugar cones are amazing. Going here is nowhere near the experience of visiting Polly Ann's or Mitchell's, so you'll be disappointed if you expect anything but good ice cream.

All I know about the historiography of Bi-Rite Creamery's reviews I learned in Jewish Studies. My Jewish Studies professor explained that historians of any event follow a very particular timeline. First, there are those affected by the event.  For them, it was a defining moment, which informs the exceptionalism of both that generation and of that people; this is our generation, we post 5-star reviews and we loudly proclaim "WE HAVE ONLY NOW BEGUN TO EAT ICE CREAM, FOR WHAT WE THOUGHT WERE 'ICE CREAMS' IN THE PAST WERE IN FACT *LIES*" to all four corners of the globe. Second, historians representing the generation to come next (these reviewers are only now being born) will cast doubt upon our 5-star reviews, saying "oh, those Bay Areans in their affected little bubble of culinary sophistication, they chose so tiny a perch from which to leer down upon so large a world." Third, the children of our children will review Bi-Rite truthfully--and the historiography will become a full and rich-bodied thing. The time is not yet right for an objective and reasoned review of Bi-Rite's "ice cream," if this manna can stand to bear so pedestrian a moniker.  So, I sigh, and I wax poetic over an ice cream--sorry--*the* *one* and *only* ice cream that I will ever go out of my way to eat.  EVER. The crème fraîche is my favorite.  By far.

Could it be that in 3 short years Bi-Rite has overtaken 56-year-old Mitchell's as the ice cream to beat in SF?  If so, they went about it pretty competently.   Step 1: Set up shop across the street from Dolores Beach, on a block already packed with foodies who are well-versed in phrases like "HTST vs UP" and "vegetarian rennet".   Step 2: Advertise that you're using Straus milk.   Step 3: Watch the lines form around the block.   Incidentally, I don't find any ice cream in the world to be worth a half-hour wait, that's why I came on my lunch break instead of a weekend.  Though I think this means you're less likely to find a special flavor.  But really, everyone should just start with 1 scoop each of salted caramel and honey lavender.  Because, all analysis aside, this stuff is bliss on a cone. So congrats, Bi-Rite.  And now every soda jerk from here to Sebastopol with an itchy scoop finger and a (mint chocolate) chip on their shoulder is gonna come gunning for *you*.  Just wait.

After  1/2 a day of loafing (thanks to hangovers and the Special Victims Unit marathon) C says, "So like.how do you feel about getting ice-cream; I know this spot that makes the best flavors, EVAR." My response: "Uh...yeah! Where's my wallet?" So we roll up on 18th Street, and I see a line that almost extends around the corner.but it's no biggie, considering that I come from the land of 1.5 hour waits for subways and Shake Shack (om nom nom!) Fifteen minutes later, we're at the front of the line in a small dessert shop with no indoor seating; just a freezer for pre-packed quarts, a ledge for freshly baked goods, and a highly accommodating staff at the register who let me taste the  before settling on a trio of Salted Caramel, Honey Lavender, and Balsamic Strawberry. And Oh Em Effin' Gee - I'm in love. Now truth be told, the Balsamic Strawberry wasn't anything special; the tangy and sour savoriness from balsamic vinegar that I love (and occasionally use as an ice-cream topping, akin to fudge) just didn't shine through the dense creaminess of the ice-cream.leaving me underwhelmed. The Honey Lavender, on the other hand, blew me away; somehow, Bi-Rite managed to capture the slightly soapy, herbal astringent-ness(?) of lavender! With every spoonful, it was like being cradled in the arms of a Provencal herb garden.or at the very least; eating sweetened high-quality triple-milled soap. Mama approves. And as for the salted caramel - WOW! Just wow. I would probably never want to eat this flavor on it's own, because it's almost *too* rich. But when completing the ice-cream trifecta, the salted caramel perfectly compliments the slightly boring strawberry and the somewhat soapy lavender. If you're a Ben-N-Jerry's aficionado, this is not the ice-cream for you; Bi-Rite's flavors are much too subtle and delicate for your harsh palate. But for the rest of us who crave creamy complimentary confectionary perfection - there's Bi-Rite.

YAY! i finally got to try the infamous Bi-Rite Creamery!  I sampled their famous flavors: Salty Caramel and Honey Lavender Salted Caramel: EEK! way way WAYYY to sweet.  i didn't enjoy it at all Honey Lavender: i also wasn't a fan of this one either..it tasted really herby The flavors i did like: Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Chocolate: YUM!  u can really tell it was homemade.  the vanilla taste was strong and the peanut brittle was crunchy and had just the right amount of sweetness Roasted Banana: i usually hate banana flavored items..the only banana things i like are the actual fruit.  However, this ice cream tasted like there were actual bananas mashed into the ice cream.  very scrumptious indeed! Ricanelas: This was also another fav flavor of mine.  This consisted of snickerdoodles and cinnamon ice cream...sounds a bit strange, but tasted like nothing i've ever had in my life.  if you're a fan of cinnamon this is a def. must for you! The prices were a little high..a single scoop (where you can choose up to two flavors) was 3.25 and we also bought a pint of ice cream which was 7.99

Nothing bad to say about this place. The ice cream is super premium, so it melts quickly. No big deal though...I took two courts home to San Mateo, so the ice cream survived a 10 minute walk to the Bart, 20 minute ride to the San Mateo Bart, and 15 minute cab drive home. Riconelas is probably my favorite. It's cinnamon flavored ice cream with chunks of chewy, yummy goodness aka snickerdoodle cookies. If you know what you want, and you want to order more than a cup, call in ahead of time so you can avoid the line. Make sure to get a stamp card too. I'm sure you'll be back! Ice cream cookies are great too, and there's usually no line at the soft serve/bakery area. I had the strawberry ice cream wedged between two sugar cookies. The strawberry ice cream was phenomenal. Though it is Balsamic Strawberry, you cannot taste the balsamic vinegar. They use the vinegar when cooking the strawberries, so it mainly burns off, and leaves this tangy hint with the extremely sweet flavor of the strawberries. It's wonderful!

Sitting at Zuni, enjoying a  leisurely Saturday lunch and the food coma was setting in.  Call it a day?  Sure...wait, light bulb!  Bi Rite Creamery for a little dessert?  Hell yeah!  Justifying the extra calories with "Well if we walk off our lunch..." we made a hasty exit and headed towards our ice cream nirvana. I'm watching my waifish figure (Kate Moss, I'm coming after you!) so went with a small, half salted caramel and half brown butter pecan.  That led to a fun interaction with the scoop girl about pronunciation: car-mel or care-a-mel?  Pee-can or pee-con?   After trying the ice cream I knew that it doesn't matter how you say it, just get down to Bi Rite Creamery and try some of the most delicious ice cream ever.

Friends took me to this charming creamery near Dolores Park. I sampled their mint chip flavor and fell in love all over again. (I LOVE mint chip in practically any form, so getting me to buy a cup of the ice cream wasn't a hard sell.) Their version was excellent: cool, smooth, with chips that weren't too huge, and melted in your mouth. On top of that, they actually took my credit card for the small purchase ($3). There's seating indoors, but most folks took their snacks outside to enjoy the (then) lukewarm San Francisco weather. We hopped across the street to the park to eat. Next time I'm in the neighborhood, I'm stopping by.

Ten stars for Bi-Rite! Yesterday I had the "Sam's Sundae." One scoop of chocolate, one scoop of honey lavender, and drizzled with olive oil and sea salt, with (almost unsweetened) whipped cream. $5.50. The olive oil does something extraordinary. The crunchy sea salt ... o m f g. Is it wrong to love something inanimate so much?? You have to have one at least once before you die. I intend to have at least 100 of these before I die.

That Almond Joy Sundae sure was good; looking and tasting (though forgot to take a pic in the haste to eat); toasted coconut ice cream; toasted almond; hot fudge. The creme fraiche too, though may be too creamy (sour cream/yogurty aftertaste) for some. I'd get both items again, yep. Long line on Sunday afternoon, down the street and around the block. Will return if in the area, hoping not with a long line, but that's just wishful thinking. Only a couple of blocks over from 16th St BART station, at the corner of the Dolores Park Tennis Courts that looks up on the park. Eat up there or one of the small benches right outside the store. A simple and relaxing pleasure, ITTET.

I was really skeptical walking into Bi-Rite. I didn't think it could possibly live up to the hype. Alas...every delicious bite did. The service was great -- the line looked long because it hung out the door so far, but the counter is right there when you get in, so it really didn't take that much time to get a cone full of deliciousness. Plus when you finally do get to the counter, they'll let you try as many flavors as you want. Usually I hate being greedy and taking advantage of such generosity, since I generally know what flavor I'm going to go with as soon as I read the menu. But I was absolutely torn between the Ricanelas (cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodles), the Brown Sugar with Salted Caramel Swirl, and the Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate. After sampling each of the three, I was still so torn. Instead of indulging and having all three, I held strong and just went with a kiddie sized Ricanelas in a sugar cone. Every bite was heaven. I will definitely be back to have equally as amazing experiences with their other flavors. If you love absolutely delicious ice cream (perfectly creamy texture, delicious flavor combinations, high quality fillings), then Bi-Rite might be your paradise. At least try it -- even the most cynical out there cannot deny that they do a really good scoop of ice cream.

After an early dinner at Koo tonight, we came to Bi-Rite for dessert.  We've been here before and loved it.  Who would not love the Sam's Sundae?  It's rich high quality chocolate drizzled with olive oil with sea salt sprinkled on top and a side of whipped cream.  Yum.   Yes, I still love Sam's Sundae and Bi-Rite.  Why the 3 stars?  I had to subtract a star for the filthy restroom.  It just grossed me out.  It was early Sunday evening and there was a long line.  That was to be expected.  But that's still no excuse for the restroom conditions.   Still love ya Bi-Rite and love the ice cream.  Can't wait to come back!

Have you ever seen the face of God? You will if you take one bite of Salted Caramel. Little baby tears sprung to my eyes and I had to think of dead pigeons so I wouldn't cry in public. Yes, it's that good. My serotonin levels shot through the roof, and my six-month-long depression was gone in seconds. Am I exaggerating? Why don't you try a scoop of Honey Lavender, a scoop of Balsamic Strawberry, and a scoop of that vanilla flavor with peanut brittle before you mock my adulation. No parking, small standing room, but my dear sweet lord, I'd walk across water to visit this Mecca of Frozen Flavor again.

Oh Bi-Rite. Your prices continue to shock and dismay... following in the steps of their namesake store, the cost of a pint of sweet delicious goodness from the creamery is a whopping $8 bucks. But you just cannot put a price on the taste of their salted caramel ice cream. To know that I live a mere 2 blocks from this place is a very dangerous thing. Had to minus a star due to the outrageous cost. But definitely 5-star flavor.

Perhaps I was expecting too much, but was simply underwhelmed by Bi-Rite Creamery. I tried the salted caramel. I was so sure I'd love it based on all of the rave reviews that I didn't even have a sample, just went for it. I am an ice cream afficionado. I usually finish my cup (yes, I'm an ice cream purist: a cup girl, not a cone girl) wanting more and more. However, I didn't even finish this ice cream. It was rich but not that satisfying, and a bit too buttery for my tastes. I'm definitely willing to try more flavors (twist my arm...) but admit that I was a bit disappointed. I had a taste of my boyfriend's cinnamon which was pretty dern tasty, but overall... I was left wanting more. I admit that part of it may be my own palate, but I've consistently enjoyed Mitchell's and Naia more.

OK, despite my still unresolved chocolate reservations,  the banana split sundae is worthwhile.  They actually caramelize the bananas by hand with some sugar and a blowtorch, while you wait.  How awesome is that? PS When they have Rocky Road, I can almost forget that the chocolate is boring.

Yum!  I'm sure every review has said they love the salted caramel ice cream.  Well I do too!  My favorite is when they have pistachio ice cream.  The brown sugar ice cream was also amazing.  I'm not a fan of floral food flavors, so we skipped those that contained lavender, etc. I'm a fan of ice cream but dairy is not a friend of mine.  So I get to experience these treats, once in a blue moon.

Easily one of the best ice creams I have ever tasted... they literally melt in your mouth (duh, I know its ice cream, but you'll understand what I mean when you go there) and will instantly get you addicted.  I drive cross town just to pick up a pint or two to take home and enjoy... of which they rarely last more than a few days.

Sure, it's pricier than the guy in the park with the freezer cart, but absolutely delicious - without that super-rich goobucket gutbomb feeling of the Ben & Jerry's/Coldstone tradition. The sundaes look great (haven't tried one yet) and the ice cream cookie sandwiches taste like they should cost $40 a pop on a street corner in the Tenderloin. Plus, they've got lots of soy options for my lactarded wife so she doesn't get jealous of whatever I order. On a 70-degree day in February, nothing like laying out in Dolores park with a couple of homemade ice cream cones to make you forget that it's only a matter of time before we sink into the ocean.

Some things are just perfect in two different planes of existence. Myself being in one (I didn't stuh-stutter..I said perfection) and BiRite, supposedly, in the other. But like Romeo and Juliet...Tiger Woods and fidelity...me and your Mom (tell her Lijah says Hiiiii!)..some things just ain't made to be. I had a feeling GOD was trynna nudge me with that plain truth a few nights ago when me and the homie dropped in to BiRiC to be decreamed (get it?? like deflowered but decr-..dangit! moving on...) Parking. We did a few laps and finally found a snug lil spot across the way. Now I coulda maneuver'd my own vehicle in there but SOMEBODY wanted to show off, and Lijh loves making the children smile..SO like the true genetleman he is, he let her have a go at parallel parking. Luckily I was there for guidance ;) We walk in, and there was a small line (bueno!) and get our turn. After some taste testing (not by me), some glaring (not by me) and some arguing (not by- okay, that was me), I got a double scoop with 2 different flavors: Earl Grey - Some things should just stay in a cup. lol. Earl Grey has always been my tea of choice and it mos'def had the taste, it was just kinda weird having it all cold like that. Threw me off indeed. Ricanelas - hmmm..horchata (or orxata)? No bueno. It tasted hella cinnamony and Im not a heavy fan of cinnamon (I'm just heavy...and also brown and sweet [grins]) so this didn't really go my way. The texture was good though and overall the flavor wasn't all that BAD, I just didn't find it all that GOOD. Now why the 3 stars? Bad scoopamentals. I got a cone, with 2 scoops stting precariously on top. Why wasn't it pushed down to so it could be secured in the waffle awesomeness that was my cone? So after a few tastes, and a slight bump from the lady in front of me and *thwap*. The floor is now enjoying my scoops. Homeboy who worked there was maddd nice however and told them to get me another 2 sccops while he took care of the mess (Sorry homie!). So now I'm back at the vehicle, new cone, new scoops, new chance, and I'm talking to the homegirl and I go to lick [ hehe] the cone and *thwap*. YUP! Guerrero st is now enjoying my scoops.

Bi Rite makes my favorite ice cream, thank god it's a thirty-minute BART ride away from me or I might not be able to fit into a BART seat anymore... They offer spot-on flavor combinations and of course the much vaunted salted caramel. The ice cream is the creamiest and smoothest I've had, no doubt due to a ridiculously high fat content. Other items available for purchase include cookies, assorted baked goods, pints of ice cream, and ice cream accompaniments (sauces, toppings, etc.) Though there's always a line, the employees seem to really know how to handle customers and move them through quickly while still providing them with samples.

This place reminded me so much of Pitango in Baltimore. The infinite flavors and creativity of all the flavors. It was so hard to narrow down the choices, but I usually go for the unusual or the funky stuff. Ricanelas and brown sugar got my votes and that's what I went for! The snicker doodles were my favorite part of Ricanelas, the brown sugar had hints of ginger which was delicious as well! With the price in mind, creativity and the fact that it's organic ice cream, you are getting a steal here! Ben & Jerry's charges a lot more whereas Bi - Rite is independent, organic and original with their flavors.

My Black Friday has been pretty laid back so far because I've ruled out shopping and dealing with the crowds in favor of staying in, and with all the leftovers from last night's food fest and On Demand on tv, I'm all set. And a great way to start the day is to have some ice cream. Luckily I found parking across the street and sampled a couple flavors (creme fraiche and toffee coffee) before I settled on a kid's cup (it's the PERFECT size) of their famous salted caramel. It's brilliant. Tastes like salty caramel popcorn (but minus the popcorn). Creamy, buttery-salty and caramelly...aww yeah!

#35 on the 2011 7x7 List: Salted Caramel ice cream #35 on the 2009 7x7 List: Salted Caramel ice cream -Tasty? Possibly the best and most memorable thing on the list so far -Service:  It's simple: They ask you what flavor and what vessel that will hold your ice cream (cup or cone) and then you hand over the money to get the ice cream.  It's that easy -Ambiance: It's a very small ice cream shop with two seats at the counter.  There are several planters outside the store that you can sit on -Worth the trip/try?  Definitely.  There are also a few things on the list in the area, so if you plan well, you can hit a few all in one trip The Salted Caramel ice cream is best eaten with a cone.  For a little under $4, the amount of ice cream you get is meager compared to other ice cream places, but the smile and sheer happiness you can derive from the delicious ice cream is worth ever penny.  I recommend going a little after lunch for dessert - there was no one there when we arrived.  If you wait till the afternoon or after dinner, you can expect to wait a while

I won't go to many places by myself and have a meal or snack but I can sit down by myself to enjoy some icecream at Bi-Rite with a smile on my face, loving life. (true story) Out of all the ice creams I have devoured in my day, Bi-Rite tops them all. Something about their unique flavors that are so bold, fresh, and decadent. I don't mess with the single scoop, if I get to come up to the city and enjoy this little heaven on earth it's only a 2 scoop sundae or 2 scoops with toppings for me. I recently had a scoop of salted caramel, a scoop of Ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles) adorned with fresh gingerbread cake pieces. DELIGHTFUL. I've also tried their baked goods: the macaroons and the lemon gingersnap were my favorite! It's a really tiny place so expect to be waiting out the door and they only have like 4 small tables inside. But trust me, none of that will matter anymore after you had your first taste of Bi-Rite!

I finally got to try this place! I got two scoops, one of coffee toffee and one of cookies and cream. They were wonderful! There are giant pieces of toffee, and real pieces of cookies. Their spoons are old fashioned, back-in-the-day wood spoons, which make it an authentic ice cream experience :). They also sell their ice cream in pints. They also have stamp cards. The staff was very friendly, and the best part: no tax! Their seating isn't the greatest, but I think most people take it to-go anyway. Definitely will come back and hopefully try all their flavors next year!

1 star for hitting the "all natural" buzz word. 1 star for hitting the "home made" buzz word. That's all.  The net result is I should have just gone to Mitchell's like my wife was saying to do. ------------------------------- Chalk.  That's what it taste's like near the end of the bite, and after.  Mitchell's tastes creamy and yummy, during, and long after the bite (or lick).  This doesn't happen with the Strawberry, so perhaps their method is best left to the fruit flavors.  And perhaps Mitchell's uses some naughty bits.  Given that I'm eating ice cream either way, I'll take the naughty bits and have something I can enjoy, thank you very much. I can't help but think the big draw here is the "fancy" flavors (yawn... enough already with the honey fig and the jasmine cow nut... just make something that tastes good!).  Example, the Mexican chocolate Ice cream with salty peanut.  This is no chocolate and peanut butter combo... it's clearly done to sound fancy, because the peanut over powers what little Mexican chocolate taste there is.  The end result is it tastes like salty peanut with a bit of chocolate... that ultimately ends up tasting like chalk.  I absolutely love Mexican chocolate, yet Bi-Rite found a way for me to want to dump it in the trash... that's no easy task.  The other combo flavors I had also sucked and I'll just leave it at that. Blah blah blah... it's not really worth going on about it.  I tried this place twice wanting to love it and both times wished I'd just gone to Mitchell's.

Yum yum yum! I get ice cream here every time I eat at Pizzeria Delfina (the PERFECT date-night combination, if you ask me).   I'm typically not one to venture away from my cookies & cream, but the girl talked me into a cookies & cream / mint combo (after promising it tasted like a Thin Mint Girlscout cookie) and OMG YUM!  Try it.

Ok I'm kind of an ice cream fanatic so I think I know what I'm talking about here. Anyone who uses Strauss family products gets a big thumbs up. Two flavors here are kickin -- Salted Caramel (INSANE) and the roasted banana. I dunno why but for some reason I always have to eat banana ice cream wherever I go.  Mint chip and coffee are also awesome. Go get yourself some of the best ice cream in the city and kick it at Dolores Park with some friends.

By golly, I feel like I've been ice cream binging this past week.  First, Mashti Malone's, then Scoops, and now Bi-Rite?  Don't judge me.  It was all so worth it. The line out the door seemed long at first, but it moved relatively quickly.  Though there were people waiting behind me, the worker was more than willing to let me sample a few flavors.  Not wanting to hold up the line, I tried my best to not try every single flavor. So I ended up getting to try Salted Caramel, Creme Fraiche, Roasted Banana, Mint Chip, Honey Lavender, Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl, Butter Pecan, and a Sundae with Hot Fudge and a Chocolate Chip Cookie. Everything was delicious.  The Salted Caramel was like a cold, melting piece of Morinaga caramel candy in my mouth.  The Creme Fraiche had an amazing, layered flavor, with a subtle, sour aftertaste.  The Mint Chip tasted like what I imagine a delicious batch of Tiger Balm medicinal balm would taste like (I've always wondered what it would taste like).  The Roasted Banana tasted just like what its name suggests, with a nice, s'more-like burnt aftertaste.  The Honey Lavendar tasted like a lavender soap bar from The Body Shop would (not that I've tried it or anything) mixed in with a twist of sweetness.  The Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl was a marriage of three amazing flavors that ended up capturing all my taste buds in a huge sweet and savory net.  And finally, the Butter Pecan did not stray too far away from its classic flavor, which is not a bad thing. The sundae was like any other sundae, just with better ice cream, and more interesting flavors.  It's always a fun idea to swirl together a bunch of different flavors, as you would a dish that you're cooking at home. More than anything, i would recommend a bowl with the Salted Caramel and the Creme Fraiche, as their flavors mix together well (salty, sweet, and sour) in a not so strange way. In terms of service, flavor selection, and taste, Bi-Rite does it right. GET:  Salted Caramel, Creme Fraiche, Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl

Bi-Rite is simply amazing. Read the reviews, most people have nothing but good things to say. I just moved back to the city recently and am therefore a Bi-Rite virgin. After 3 years in Boston enjoying delicious J.P. Lick's ice cream I was afraid I wouldn't find a new ice creamery to fill the hole in my heart. Alas, that worry has be squashed. As we walked up to this little hole in the wall there was a line outside. This did not surprise me given the sheer number of reviews on Yelp. However, the people working were quick and the line moved swiftly. We tried the malted vanilla, toasted banana, honey lavender and Ricanela (snicker doodle). All were great. I'm a banana fan and so it was right up my alley. The snicker doodle had a great not-to-sweet cinnamon taste and the malted vanilla was creamy with a clear malt taste. My only suggestion would be to have a stronger lavender flavor b/c it was too light to be tasted when eaten with other flavors. Not a big deal, it was still tasty. Do yourself a favor and try it out. Don't bother with Ben and Jerry's or Dreyers - support your local ice creamery.

Bi-Rite, my love... Not that this place needs any more reviews but... please try their Honey Lavender, Earl Gray, Blood Orange, and Salted Caramel. HOLY MOLY.  All of these are true to flavor... my favorite combination, as suggested by the kind and hip girl working behind the counter, is the Honey Lavender and Blood Orange combo, or Honey Lavender and Earl Gray.  The ice cream consistency is great -- creamy, thick, and dense... just the way real ice cream should be, and they all taste exactly like what they're called. It's magical. On the real though, almost every single flavor offered is superb and unique. Balsamic Strawberry?! Mexican Chocolate with salted peanuts?! Malted Vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate...? Brown Sugar with caramel swirl (*drool*)... and their Mint Chip is naturally color-less (which I love)! ugh, it's disgusting how much I am enamored by Bi-Rite. The line is definitely long but the employees are QUICKWIDIT, plus the ice cream is well WORTH the wait anyhow.  If I lived in SF, I would frequent this place at least once a week and withstand the long line. The place is small and can only seat so many people but there's a huge park across the creamery so tight seating's not a big deal. Overall: 5 stars for service, 5 stars for reasonable prices, 5 stars for great great great ice cream! The only negative thing about Bi-Rite? They don't have MANGO!! It's okay, I still love you so much, Bi-Rite. **If you prefer not to wait, you can get a pre-packed pint of their ice cream at their Bi-Rite market a couple of steps down. **Takes credit card, whee!

I am never disappointed with this place. I normally get the Salted Caramel and the Honey Lavender ice cream. This time I tried the Earl Grey tea ice cream and it is hands down, the BEST. You need to try. Best thing to do is go in the store and get the pints. No lines. No waiting. Stock up on Bi-Rite in your freezer and you'll always be happy. That's what I did. Now I have Earl Grey ice cream in my freezer for the rest of the week. Yeah!

I was in San Francisco for a week and during this time I tried to sample all of the offerings on hand at Bi-Rite Creamery --- I know, I am so giving to you people. Here is my report: Salted Caramel ---  I really can't speak about it, it's too good, it's so rich, it's so the perfect ice cream that I can't even finish a whole cone, dang, yeah. Caramel and Pralines --- Even more perfect. I can definitely finish a whole cone so no need to share --- haha! Coffee Toffee --- Oh sweet sweet nectar of the God's this is some strong coffee and the toffee chips are huge and you know what they say about big toffee chips...yup, good eatin'. Chocolate Chip Mint --- Tasted more like peppermint with chocolate...I for one don't consider that a bad thing, I'd get it again, for sure. Honey Lavender --- Where's the lavender? It just tasted like honey, which is tasty but not as complex as one might hope. Soy Chocolate --- I suppose if I were lactose intolerant this would be a nice treat, but thank the good ice cream heavens that I have working enzymes and don't have to eat this for dessert. Summary: Bi-Rite Creamery has good ice cream the way Jimmy Hendrix has good guitar playing abilities.

Hi!! If you just did a review search for Bi-Rite and you just happened to come upon my review out of 3000+, I would like to congratulate you! I will offer you a free FUC. Just send me a compliment on your smart phone, if you happen to be waiting in the long ass line. Ok, so this is what I've tried so far. Salted Caramel - very good, my favorite so far! Malted Vanilla - It's ok, light malt flavor... I wanted something heavier. Brown Butter Pecan - It's ok... not my bag baby.

You know, it was good...but it didn't blow my mind. I thought it was SOOOO SWEET! I had the Coffee Toffee and the Mayan Chocolate. Both had good flavor, but like I said. SWEET. Major pluses: compostable cups, friendly servers, and they take credit cards even for a $3 purchase. And a small was $3.25 and I thought it was a pretty good size serving. Also I know they use all organic milk and cream which is pretty awesome. Minuses: Overwhelming sweetness. It just didn't rock my panties off. Overall I enjoyed my experience, but I definitely wouldn't stand in the normally gigantic line for it. Honestly, when it comes to ice cream in SF, I'd rather go to Mitchells or grab some gelato.

The selection of ice cream here is amazingly delicious. Located on the corner of Dolores and 18th Street, it's THE place to go for something fruity, creamy and delicious before you head across the street to Dolores Park to enjoy the throngs of San Franciscans. I've become a scoop-hound here, and will occasionally splurge on one of their amazing sundaes, and on a warm day (rare for SF) their popsicles can seem heaven-sent. So run, don't walk whenever you're in the neighborhood, or take MUNI over for something yummy. MA

Long line, BUT it moves pretty fast. When I was sneaking a peek into the store I over heard a person say that the ice cream was like an orgasm in his mouth. I was like WHAT?!?! So when I got up to the line I wanted to see what this guy was taking about... I got to try at least 3 flavors and I didn't feel rush at all. My two favorites are the Ricanela icecream with snickerdoodle cookie dough and balsamic strawberry. This place really does live up to the hype!!!! All the flavors  were handwritten. I would go back again and again and again. Oh yeah and they have a restroom for you to use which is pretty clean.. I know because I really had to pee when I got to the store haha. *HIGH FIVE* for awesomeness ice cream!

After shopping at Bi-Rite market we walked across the street to get some ice cream. Line wasn't very long, but tons of people after me.  Saw Happy Goat caramels sold here too, I bought them at the Bi-Rite Market. I tried Malted vanilla w/ peanut brittle & milk chocolate pieces.  It was good. Then I just asked for a single (1-2 flavors) for $3.25 in a cup.   Went to the soft-serve window.  Tried the twist - 1/2 caramel & 1/2 chocolate.  Tasted ok.  Lots of cookies & cupcakes you can look at and buy.

Mexican chocolate is my favorite so far.  I love the kick of cinnamon in Mexican hot chocolate and Bi-Rite puts in just enough.  Some of the other flavors I find lose this subtlety.  The honey lavender was just too much lavender for me.  I like the scent in my laundry but how did this flower become such a frequent flyer into my food?  The ice cream is reminiscent of licking the bathroom floor, albeit a clean floor, but still a floor.  Don't even try to throw that "how do you  know what a bathroom floor tastes like" question.  It's a long story.  I'm kidding.  So I digress... All other lavender scented food products I've tasted (cookies, crème brulee, other ice creams) have that toilet quality.  So it's not exactly a bad ice cream, just not my preference.  The salted caramel on the other hand, I did think was bad.  That ice cream so numbed my taste buds that after a few bites I had no idea what I was eating.  When I switched over to roasted banana I couldn't taste a thing.  The only way I knew there was ice cream in my mouth was because it was cold.  To me, that is the sign of a bad ice cream. Bi-Rite is good and their flavors are fun but not as good as everyone makes them out to be.  So far Swensen's is winning my heart.

I L-O-V-E YOU Bi Rite Creamery.  Thank you for being in existence and allowing me to be in Ice Cream heaven.   I got a single scoop of my first ever salted caramel & a scoop of cinnamon snicker doodle ice cream.  So delicious!  I loved the pieces of chewy snicker doodle cookie in my ice cream.  Slap those two flavors together and they make a perfect combination!   I seriously considered getting a pint or two or more.... for my trip back to LA, but I couldn't find dry ice and wasn't sure if it would keep well.  I guess I'll just have to come back to SF a lot sooner than I was planning to...  HOORAY!

You know what. I was pretty impressed with all the fans that were here for a Friday night. The line was out the door until it hit the corner of the sidewalk and the intersection of Dolores. Top 3 Flavors 1) Roasted Banana - for some reason I keep wanting to call it Burnt Banana. HAHAHA...It is extremely good, does really taste like a banana, but a little bit more sweeter. ( I usually hate the taste of over riped bananas. UGH!) 2) Ricanelas - cinnamon with snickerdoodles. Damn, this flavor is to die for!!! NOTHING like it. Wow. Wow, wow!!! 3) Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces - I saved this best for last. If you love texture and substance in your food. DAMN! PLEASE do NOT miss out on this flavor!! Not too sweet, not too salty. PERFECTION. I'm happy with the flavors that I chose. For standing in that long line which only took about 15 minutes. I was not gonna walk out that door with just 1 flavor. You know who helped me with the flavors I chose?! SALINA (with the purple hair). I was super impressed with the customer service, my friend & I were not rushed at all. She whipped out those samples & spoons without hesitation after we told her it was our FIRST visit. Great service til the end. The dude even gave me a frequent buyer card thing. Thank you Bi-Rite Creamery for being so kind & so sweeeet!!

Okay, seriously.  1600 people who rated a place and overall it's 4 1/2 stars ... you probably cannot go wrong with Bi-Rite unless: 1) you hate ice cream 2) you hate sweets 3) you have no soul The first time I tried Bi-Rite I was blown away by their flavors, and my favorite (given that I have sweet teeth, not just one tooth) was the salted caramel.  I highly caution those of you who aren't as big of a fan of sweet stuff.  Other great flavors are Strawberry Balsamic and Honey Lavender (much lighter).   The ice cream is just home made, creamy, and made with love.   The one star? Okay, well, I was watching a Food Network episode and this chef was gushing about the sam's sundae.  "Get it," she urged through the TV, "the melodious flavors of the bergamot olive oil and chocolate ice cream are amazing, and the sea salt makes it even SWEETER!  It can't be beat."  Well, uh, it's....just kind of odd.  Although I could try to appreciate it, it just wasn't up my alley.  There was too much salt in quite a few bitefuls, and also the olive oil solidified and didn't make me too ga-ga like I was told I would be.  Plus, quite a few friends made "oh thats...interesting" faces when I made them try it. Stick to the other choices.  You won't regret it.

Our motorcycle ride ended right in front of Bi Rite Creamery and I knew we had to stop in when I saw the Bi Rite Creamery chalkboard with all their yummies listed. I had the salted caramel with house made fudge and he had the banana with house made fudge. The salted caramel had a wonderful rich caramel flavoring with just the right amount of salt. The house made fudge was thick and flavorful. The banana tasted like slightly overripe bananas, just how I like them. We took our ice creams to Dolores Park and had a nice little walk around the park. I even got a kiss under the mistletoe. I highly recommend Bi Rite Creamery, and kisses under mistletoe.

This is probably the best ice cream I've had EVER!! The line was pretty long this past Saturday. After 30 minutes of standing in line, I finally made it to the counter and took another 20 minutes just 'tasting' ALL their flavors. I settled on the Sam's sundae but I took pints of the ricanelas, roasted bananas and balsamic strawberry to go. The pints sure didn't last long and it looks like I'll be back in the City this weekend for more. Note to Self: BRING LARGER COOLER w/ ICE

THIS IS MY FAVORITE ICE CREAM STORE IN SAN FRANCISCO!!! No scratch that... probably my favorite ice cream store of all time. Yes. you better freaking believe it. The line is always outrageous during peak hours, but believe me, it's worth it. I've tried most of the flavors on the menu and I would say my top 5 are: Honey Lavender, Ricanela, Roasted Banana, Salted Caramel, and Toasted Coconut. I had to list top 5 because honestly... you can't go wrong with any flavor at bi-rite. The ice cream here is just so creamy and fresh, my heart melts with every bite. This place definitely lives up to the hype, Bi-rite is the best. Tip: To save time buy the pre-packed pints. Your friends and family will love you for it too!

Last week, I finally went into Bi-Rite Creamery.  I had really high hopes and expectations about this place.  You know how this story is going to end . . . I did a double of 3 flavors.  I did my Yelp research on this place and everyone raved about 2 flavors.  Yes, you know what they are:  Salted Caramel and Honey Lavender.  Unfortunately, I have to say I was heartbroken with these flavors.  I was confused with the taste of the Salted Caramel being toffee-like or almost butter pecan.  Strange but true.  The Honey Lavender had too much lavender for my palate, which reminded me of air freshener.  I decide to finish them anyway to: 1) make sure my tastebuds were working, 2) refresh me on a warm day.  After all, it's still ice cream. The 3rd flavor was my lifesaver:  balsamic strawberry.  This flavor was delicious!!  A fruity flavored ice cream without being too rich and having more substance than a sherbet.  Bless this flavor! Bi-Rite Creamery, you have not seen the last of me!  Worth going back for the balsamic strawberry.  My favorite flavors are still yet to be discovered.

I'm keeping my review short (like the amount of time my ice cream lasted) and sweet (like the flavors and memories that were conjured up after my first Bi-Rite experience).   1. Salted Caramel:  No brainer. There's a reason why everyone raves about it. Just read the next 1000 reviews after mine. 2. Coffee: pretty darn good. We got some because they were out of the strawberry balsamic and orange cardamom.  Very intense coffee flavor that beats anything at Starbucks, hot or cold. 3. Blood Orange: Tastes like you're eating fresh blood oranges - simultaneously sweet & tart and it looks like you're eating frozen blood - slurp! 4. Creme Fraiche: had a hint of citrus to it but it was nice and silky. The winner:  The blood orange combined with the creme fraiche was like eating a very sophisticated orange cream-sickle!  Brought back memories of chasing down the ice cream truck as a child.  I've been to Italy and had some amazing gelato that I'll never forget & I'm sure there are many native Italians who have visited San Francisco who have been to Bi-Rite creamery who thought they were back in Rome.

Growing up Chinese-American has its privileges (everyone assumes you are good at math and were born with the ability to play the violin) and its disadvantages, mainly that you are not allowed to be frivolous at any time - even when, say, it is your seventh birthday and you want a sundae. Chinese families have an unspoken code when dining out - thou shalt not order drinks other than water/tea (if free) and thou shalt not get anything more than a single scoop of ice cream on a sugar cone. If you see an Asian person drinking a coke at a restaurant, chances are, they are not Chinese. So at 28-(ahem, please allow an old lady some dignity)- I had my first Sundae - a banana split at Bi-rite. Holy Crap! I can't believe I've allowed my parents to keep me away from a caramelized banana, two scoops of ice cream (three in my case brown sugar with ginger swirl, malted vanilla with toffee peanuts, and balsamic strawberry, cause that is how I roll), hot fudge which solidifies against the cold ice cream, whipped cream and walnuts.  I found the whipped cream to be superfluous.  Just give me the ice cream! So as of yesterday, I have cast off the emotional restraints that my parental units have imposed on me and realized my dream of eating a Sundae. My shrink would be proud.

YES. GO PLEASE! FOR YOUR OWN WELL-BEING AND LIFE ENJOYMENT. Seriously though, this place is awesome! I got in when there was no line, so maybs my opinion is extra positive. But I also heard an overload of hype about this place from several friends, so I think that balances things out. Well, the salted caramel...duhhh. I'm not stating anything new. But the Honey Lavendar was the best I've had in all these weird-ass experimental-flavored ice cream shops that have been popping up everywhere. Awesome texture. Awesome flavor. Awesome service. Seriously everyone working there was sooo friendly! And seemingly excited to give out samples--I had to wonder if that was really real life...it was. Go at least one time and you will live a happier life.

It was the perfect MLK weekend!  Weather was on point, peeps were here from Maui, money in the bank, etc.  After a heart clogging session eating Silogs in DC (what a shocker), I wanted to get some dessert in the city.  Thankfully the other Oompa Loompas were on the same page.  I've been told to come here but have never had the opportunity till now and none of the other people in the car have ever been there.  So yay!  I wasn't the only Bi-Rite virgin.  I knew exactly where it was located when I saw the line of people rounding the corner of the creamery.  Nice!  If that doesn't tell you that you've 'arrived', then I don't know what does.   I got the salted caramel and honey lavender.  A little salty to go with the sweet.  We got our cup of love and headed to Dolores park, where apparently everybody and their mama was there enjoying the crazyness that has become Global Warming.  Call me crazy, but all I wanted to do was hold a boom box over my head and play "One Love" by Bob.

Being that this was my first time in SF, I wanted to try the best bites [at an affordable price] and Bi-Rite definitely did not disappoint. Small little set-up off the side of a street in Mission. There was a decently sized line leading out of the shop, nothing I've never encountered. What I loved about this place? They didn't give you dinky little plastic spoons for samples like the ice cream places in SoCal - they give you full-on dinner spoons and huge sample servings. I went with the Toffee Coffee, and OH MY MOTHER!! Huge chunks of toffee nuggets and coffee'ized coffee ice cream. There was ground coffee IN the ice cream to give it the super duper extra aromatic flavor that kicks you in the face. Sure, the ice cream was more expensive than say, the likes of Rite-Aid, and was even pricier than the likes of Baskin-Robbins and Fosselmans, but who am I kiddin'? Why am I even comparing such great ice cream to such basic, low quality junk like the aforementioned joints? Bi-Rite - I will be sure to visit you every time I go to SF - you are FAR TOO LOVELY to pass up. LOVE IT!

Is Bi-Rite overhyped and need a good ego thrashing?  Maybe.  But I can't resist the salted caramel like everyone else in San Francisco!  Our love may be indirect but it was real; I stole spoonfuls from my ice cream partner in crime. I ordered the honey lavender and earl grey ice cream.  Unfortunately, honey lavender reminded me of lotion.  The earl grey was the redeeming grace - a perfect touch of bergamot to lighten my day. I can only imagine what earl grey and salted caramel must taste like! I may have to put a copyright on this combo.

Salted Caramel Ice Cream !!!!! Need I say more?!?! Ok maybe a few more words: 1. There is a separate express line for couple of ice cream flavors including your famous salted caramel ice cream flavor. 2.  The ridiculous long line around the block actually goes by pretty quickly so do not be discouraged! 3.  Go grab an ice cream and enjoy your day at Dolores Park.  It is the perfect location for a sunny day! 4.  Special home made toppings available!

*heart heart* omg.... Bi-Rite makes my heart sing with joy and my tastebuds dance. I don't care if its pouring out or sunny or late at night, but every chance I get to go into the city, I try to make it out for a scoop of ice cream. Creamy. Rich. Ice cream. Ice cream that's so good that I get excited when I have plans to go... so excited that I'd want to eat the ice cream before dinner. Or even for breakfast. Salted caramel.... toasted coconut.... chocolate... *DROOL* SOOOOO freaking good. I want to get a big vat of it, roll around and smile with glee. Better yet, I want to install a nice freezer unit under my bed, stock if full of ice cream and just reach down and grab it so I can eat in bed. Morning. Day. and Night. I have a sickness. I'm obsessed with my next trip to Bi-Rite. Oh... why do you have to be so far away from me? :(

Best ice cream eva.... I'm in love.  I don't know what else to say that the 3,000 + reviews haven't said already.  Other than I agree it's deelish and this is for sure one of my stops when I'm back in the bay for a visit. I had the double ice cream cone- salted caramel and ricanelas (cinnamon and snickerdoodle).  Fantabulous.  Luscious.  Delicious. They apparently have some usual flavors but also some specials of the day scrawled on the board.  The staff was so friendly and let us sample as many as we wanted, but I only sampled one.   I was curious about the lavendar and honey because I wondered if it would taste like my lotion or scented oils.  The taste is actually not that bad and I recommend if you are looking for a "different" flavor.   But I"m glad I went with my choices.   The 30 minute wait was soooo worth it!

So close to 4.5 stars... Found Bi-Rite on a recommendation from the hotel concierge and it did not disappoint.  Although, as our first experience, we found it odd that SFers were lining up in mid 60-degree weather for a scoop of ice cream.  Now we know why!  Another bonus - they were open an hour later than many of the competitors. The flavors are decidedly unique and tasty, yet we learned that the top sellers do run out early in the evening.  Rather than gush on about the flavors (which can be found in nearly any other review), I'll share some of my likes.  Passing a menu down the line = great idea!  Crowd-control and line management made the wait shorter than expected, too.  Super friendly servers that know I want to try EVERYTHING, even though I politely decline.  Nice soft-serve option next door, but that's not why we came... I found some of the flavors to be icy or crystallized, not entirely smooth and creamy.  While each tasted amazing, the textures were inconsistent and sometimes lacking IMHO.  The sundaes looked awesome, but my first trip is always the purest - why load up the toppings before I know how good the base is?  I'm just not sure I'd want to wait in that line again. It's in my ice cream "top 20" now, but I'll need another visit to see if it's really 5 star worthy.

I heard a lot of things about Bi Rite Creamery and so I decided to try it. I came with a friend  and got a scoop of vanilla and balsamic strawberry. The ice cream tasted good but I was a little disappointed with the price to portion ratio. My friend also got two scoops, watermelon ad Ginger and the total got both was $7. I know it doesn't sound all that expensive but imagine hospital ice cream cups and two scoops of ice cream fitting into the cup. I couldn't really decide on 2 or 3 star so I just gave a 3 star, giving them the benefit of the doubt.

I've waited to review Bi-Rite for 5 years because I wanted to return to my favorite ice cream shop of all time in Florence, Italy.  Gelato in my mind was the best variation on ice cream ever.  Well, I went on June 3, 2011.  Gelato in Italy is not the same anymore.  It now sucks a$$.  I am soooooooooooo sad!   Bi-Rite is the best ice cream in the world.  Hands down.  SF Chronicle people have no idea what they are talking about with the list... Mitchell's is good, but Bi-Rite is the best. There.  I've made my declaration.

I finally forced myself not to have dessert at Ti Couz in order to give Bi-Rite a try and I admit, it was worth it. I had a single scoop of salted caramel and coffee toffee. And I agree with other Yelpers, this ice cream combination has to be the best in all the land. The crunchy toffee bits melded perfectly with both flavors and I will definitely be getting a double scoop next time. And boy howdy, there WILL be a next time. Update: All my out of town guests love Bi Rite! Though most recently my coffee toffee was too...coffee-y. Too many coffee grounds, I guess. But I have a new favorite combination....lavender honey and orange cardamom! Update 2: Today is my birthday and I have a new new favorite, ricanela cinnamon ice cream with homemade snickerdoodles! Update 3: *mouth full* Mmm, malted vanilla and peanut brittle! They also offer Kika's Treats cocoa nib shortbread as a topping now. Mmm... Update 4: Ick. Almond cherry was not good...

I Scream, You Scream, We all Scream for Ice Cream! Okay, up until today, I thought Marianne's ice cream in Santa Cruz had to be my fave. Well, now I think there is enough room in my heart for two places. Opposite ends of the Bay at that! If I had a heart necklace, I would break one half off for Bi-Rite and the other half for Marianne's. One day hoping that the two would unite in creamy goodness. Line felt long but it actually went fast. A friend I was visiting in SF happens to live a few blocks away. I wasn't in the mood for dessert until she mentioned Bi-rite and my ears perked up. This place was on my radar and I thought, well, what would a little ice cream hurt, huh? (I like to convince myself that sweets are a primary food group). Staff were incredibly nice and fun too! I can't believe anyone could be thin after working there, but the people behind the counter were young, friendly and thin. Go figure! The ice cream was unique in that it reminded me of the consistency of gelato more than a traditional ice cream. I am not sure if that is why it felt like it melted fast, because it was a little chilly and windy outside, so there was no reason for it to melt quickly. It didn't deter me from drinking my serving though! hehe. The flavors more than anything were what won this ice cream a place in my heart. I really enjoyed the salted caramel, malted vanilla with peanut brittle and chocolate, and the roasted banana!

I'm a big supporter of homemade anything! And homemade ICE CREAM? Bring it onnnnnnnnnnnn! After a big dinner somewhere on Valencia/Mission Streets, do stop by Bi-Rite and get a scoop of their honey lavendar ice cream. Sounds weird but it's uber uber uber refreshing. It's light and honestly don't feel like you're eating heavy fatty ice cream. They have so many weird flavors from salted caramel to roasted bananas, but I'm compelled to believe that they are all really good. I'm definitely coming back to try more unique flavors.

Here's something many people don't know about me, a native Chicagoan: I suffer from cold urticaria.  That means when I get too cold, I break out in hives.  It's a crappy allergy, and it's also one of the main reasons why I moved to LA.  Still, I heard so many great things about Bi-Rite that I just HAD to stop by for a visit during a short weekend trip to San Francisco.  And of course, the day I decided to go, it was really cold and rainy out.  Perfect for ice cream, huh? Well, let me just say, hives and ensuing itchiness didn't deter me, and I'm so glad I came!  Salted caramel + honey lavender in a cup made me forget that I have one of the stupidest allergies in the world.  Love, love, love!  The ice cream was really smooth in my mouth, and the caramel was almost *too* salty, but not quite.  Next time I'm in the area, I'm bringing my Benadryl so I can have my ice cream without the hives.

What is it about cold blustery days that makes me want ice cream? Mmm...ice cream! Bi-Rite is DAMN GOOD ice cream. Seriously. You can just taste the quality of ingredients and the creamy texture is must for your tongue to experience. Mmm... Lots of fancy, unusual flavors and a small soy selection for our vegan friends. And yeah, I'm going to say it's better than Mitchell's. Mitchell's is good but Bi-Rite is gourmet! (Hence paying $2.95 for a single scoop.) I sampled the honey lavender but found it a bit too perfumey. So I had a single cone of salty caramel on a cone. A single scoop was just enough as the sweet flavor of this ice cream became overwhelming by the end and all I wanted was to eat the cone. If ice cream isn't your thing, they have a whole wall of candies and other confectionery goodies. You have to also commend this creamery for using organic ingredients and metal spoons for tasting instead of like other places that use disposable plastic spoons. Only in San Francisco. Way to be eco-conscience!

So how did I not have ANY clue that Bi-Rite existed until last night at dinner??  It's true everyone I had no idea. Amazing seriously.  I like to think I am in the know about certain places, but apparently my skills in the ice cream area are a bit weak.  Thankfully my foodie friends make up for my ignorance.   After a yummy catch up dinner with my friend Jen she looked at me and said hey let's go to Bi-Rite I haven't been and am dying to try it.  I was like what is that?  I soon found out.  So Bi-Rite is homemade yummy unique ice cream you all must try some time very soon. Jen had warned me about the line and on a Monday cool SF night she wasn't joking.  We waiting about 10-15 minutes which I guess is good because usually the wait is much longer.  The flavors they have are all very unique and you feel like you want to try not just one, but like 3 or 4.  So for $4.75 you get three scoops, three choices.  I would say you should try what they are famous for which is the Salted Carmel.  Very good if you like a salty sweet taste which I do.  I also had the Brown Butter Pecan....heavenly.  And rounded out my three with the Malted Vanilla which was very creamy and again very good. You can tell this place takes pride in their product and it's made very well.  The price may seem steep but the quality makes up for it and it was a great after dinner snack for sure.  Thanks Jen for exposing me to Bi-Rite I know I will be back again!!

3 years later, and I finally made it to Bi-Rite Creamery! The flavors are like new classics in our gastro-society:  Salted Caramel, Balsamic Strawberry, Brown Butter Pecan, Creme Fraiche, Honey Lavender.   A single is just enough for a summer's day refresher. Check out their sundaes, and their little annex next door with baked goods and soft serve!

If this place respected its clientele enough to move to a place big enough to accomodate its fans, instead of cultivating its cult-like status by making us stand out in a line stretching halfway to the Pacific Ocean, I'd give it the 5th star it probably deserves if taste and selection were the only criteria. Look, the salted caramel and roasted banana flavors are two of the finest things I've ever had in my mouth, and this is coming from somebody who is intimately devoted to what may be the best ice cream ever concocted, Graeter's Black Raspberry Chip from Cincinnati. It's just too bad that one has to miss out on it so often because the line is just too formidable.

Forget your fatty 31 Flavors!  Bi-Rite offers some amazing original flavors that leaves you yearning for more! Which...is why I came back the day after (=  I LOVE LOVE coconut and for years have been a fan of pineapple coconut ice cream.  But Bi-Rite offered me a new twist to try - Chocolate Coconut (it's considered vegan because rather than using milk, coconut milk is used, YUM!)  Rich, aromatic, and creamy.  So delicious, you have to control yourself by taking small portions just so that you can savor each scoop! There was a new flavor the second time I went to Bi-Rite.  It's hidden in the lower right hand corner of the fridge.  I don't remember what it's called, but it has crushed Snikerdoodle cookies swirled into the ice cream.  The sample was delicious!  Wish I had traded my scoop of Salty Caramel for a scoop of that Snikerdoodle :D

I scream, you scream, we all scream, for BI-RITE!!!!! My friend being the major ice cream fanatic that she is, googled and yelped a list of ice cream places that she wanted to hit up while we were in SF. Since we were heading to Alamo Square to see the Painted Ladies (Full House houses), we decided to head on over to Bi-Rite to appease her ice cream craving (I would say satisfy, but she's never satisfied with the amount of ice cream she eats). Pulling up to the place, we saw the long line that went out of the store and wrapped around Dolores St. I don't know about you, but when I see lines like that, I feel safe in knowing how "too legit to quit" a place is. Sure it was a low 60 degrees out, but we had our coats on, and we waited patiently for our chance to get some ice cream. I decided to get three flavors: roasted banana (mmm), honey lavender (more mmm), and earl grey (maximum mmm). The roasted banana had that real banana taste to it, none of that artificial crap that some places try to pass off as banana. The honey lavender was a good mix of the two flavors without one over powering the other. The taste had a flowery after taste, but a pleasant one. Now the earl grey I was skeptical to try since I absolute detest the tea, but I wanted to give it a try because it sounded too interesting to pass up on. Yeah, I'm hella glad I tried it since it turned out to be my favorite flavor of the bunch. I don't know how to describe it, but safe to say it's not anything like the tea (which may be a bad thing if you love the tea). Over all, I'd say it was a very well worth it 40 minute wait for ice cream. Definitely a place to go to when your in the city. Can't wait to go back with my darling churro (Cheryl Y.)

I don't understand!!! Why is it so good?! Salted Caramel, Roasted Banana, Brown Sugar, and Malted Vanilla ... Oh my!! Oh god even their cookies are super delicious. I've been wanting to try their Earl Grey after hearing so much about it from others but they didn't have it today since they're selections change daily. I thought it was neat that they gave you a silver spoon for each sample of delicious ice cream goodness. Makes it feel more... authentic. To the right of the main shop, there's a mini window where you can order soft serve. But no matter where you decide to go be prepared to stand in a long line.

What to eat? Head on down to Bi-Rite Creamery and lets your senses be awakened... There's always a queue for this place, but the staff are efficient and it moves fast. You may be overwhelmed by the variety on offer, but don't worry... THEY'RE ALL GOOD. And besides, the brownie sundae is to die for. Panty-dropping-lcious, to paraphrase a friend.

A fellow yelper (thanks lux!) turned me onto this place with his review on the Salted Caramel ice cream. After 1484 reviews, there not much I can say about this place except that they're AWESOME! The first time I came here was with my mom after having lunch at Pizza Delfina. It was on a week day during work hours which was nice because there wasn't a line and we were able to taste the different flavors to our hearts content. And after trying so many different flavors, who knew my favorite would be the Salted Caramel. It's sweet but not too sweet, it's the perfect balance between the two flavors. GO TRY IT!

There are places that you like, and then there are places that you LOVE... And Bi-Rite--I LOVE! Everyone likes ice cream right? From the stuff you get in the supermarkets or the ice cream man, to the stuff you get from ice cream parlors/shops... But until you've experienced Bi-Rite, you haven't really experienced the real thing. It's like waking up from a really long & foggy dream, like the light at the end of the tunnel, the caviar of all ice creams. Bi-Rite has the BEST flavors that ice cream has to offer. Coffee toffee, salted caramel, honey lavender, thin mint... They put a creative twist on "regular flavors," meanwhile completely staying faithful to the TRUE taste of the flavors. EXAMPLE(s): Eating their coffee toffee ice cream is like having the BEST coffee put into a scoop and plopped onto a (sugar) cone. The bits of toffee adds extra crunch and flavor--it isn't overpowering and it's just in total harmony with the coffee. The mint chip is PERFECT--they don't use the cheap green artificial coloring, just real mint flavor with lots of chocolate shaving chips.. Thin enough to melt in your mouth, and big enough to be able to taste. Honey lavender is exactly its description. You get the flavor and aroma of lavender with the sweetness of honey. YUM. Bi-Rite is small, and very quaint. There are about 3-4 small wood tables inside, and a few on the outside. Be prepared for about a ten minute wait... They have stamp cards (awesome!) There is NO BETTER than Bi-Rite. Definitely my favorite ice cream, ever.

Look for the neon pink ice cream cone above the door, a line anytime of the day & the handwritten menu on the chalk board outside & you'll know you've arrived at the Bi-rite Creamery (across the street from the Bi-Rite Market.) I finally settled on coffee toffee & brown sugar ginger swirl (both were sugary sweet & worth the wait) after sampling a buncha flavors: honey lavender, salted caramel & malted vanilla with peanut brittle. The guy helping me was totally patient with my indecisiveness & wasn't all "judgey-eyes" about me sampling. I loved the texture of the two flavors I had-extra, super, doped up on velvet creamy but still had crispy bits of toffee or brown sugar running through it. You can tell they only use high quality ingredients & that they care about servin' up some high end ice cream. Bi-Rite ice cream is like the Louis Vuitton of ice creams. Thank goodness I don't live anywhere near here because at $4.75 for 2-3 decent sized scoops, I'd be in some serious trouble with my favorite pair of "skinny" jeans. *update 9.18.09* i usually only like lavender in my massage oils, but their honey lavender changed my perception--honey lavender ice cream is amazing.

You must try the salted caramel ice cream!  It is worth the wait although I've never waited very long. Must be the off times I visit them. The toffee ice cream is my second favorite flavor.  I've tried the lavender honey and I don't particularly care for it. It was too much lavender for my taste and left me with the feeling of having a mouthful of lavender soap.  Just not my taste.  Parking can be a hassle but you might find a space a couple of blocks away if you don't mind the walk. It justifies eating ice cream!

First time I went to Bi-Rite Creamery, I thought "what an odd location for an ice cream place. I don't think they'll do very well." A few months later I was soaking up the rays at Dolores Park and we all decided we wanted an ice cream. And what was round the corner? That's right, Bi-Rite. The line was round the block, consisting almost entirely of park -goers. Makes perfect sense to me now. I am an idiot. PS Oh, and the ice cream? Well, it's no Mitchell's, but it's pretty damn good. And on a hot San Francisco day (don't snigger, we have them every now and again), when you're in the park, there's no more convenient place to pick up a scoop or two.

Move to San Francisco for this place.  Don't leave because of it.  Become a slave.  If I grew ice cream for hair, I would fight faust for the right to grow bi-rite.  A list: Brown sugar with ginger-caramel swirl Peanut butter with fudge swirl Honey lavender Roasted banana Malted canilla with peanut brittle THOSE ARE MY FAVES. However, something terrible has happened.  Not terrible in a take-a-star-away kind of way.  But nonetheless, my spine has been chilled: brown sugar with ginger-caramel swirl has not been on the menu for 9 months.  WHAT IS HAPPENING??????? Bi-Rite, must I beg? Seriously though, I cry into my latest cone as I strut Dolo mojo all the way home.

It is a beautiful sunny day in SF, warm and just a bit breezy. After spending nearly half an hour looking for parking, I walk up to Bi-rite and see that a line has formed. Lucky for me, it moves quickly. The workers inside are very friendly and let me take 4 flavor samples. I ordered a double (3 flavors) in a cup for $4.75. I got my hands on some Salted Caramel, Ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles), and Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle. One of workers gave me a cone on top, which made me an even happier camper. Can't name a favorite flavor yet, since I only tried 3. I loved the peanut brittle bits in the smooth and creamy Malted Vanilla. I equally loved the cinnamony flavor and the chewy snickerdoodle chunks in the Ricanelas. I did like the Salted Caramel, but after eating half of that scoop, the saltiness became too strong for me. I guess I'm not much of a savory eater. I also noticed that the Salted Caramel softens quicker than the other flavors that I got. And attention all people who like unique flavors! I saw that they had Olive Oil and Basil! They told me that the two would fair well as a combo.

I just want to say I hate ice cream. I just do. It's cold, and a lot of times it doesn't taste good, hurts my throat, cold stuff makes me cough a lot, potential diabetic risk, and blah blah blah. I fell in love with ice cream when I had some of Bi-Rite's ice cream. Pretty cheap too considering it's all homemade. I swear to god, ice cream will never be the same because of this. I almost wish I could order some right now. *salivate* Lame part? The bizarre line. I tell you, if there's one thing I cannot stand it's standing for long periods of time. Second to that is standing in a line. The WORST is standing in line for long periods of time which is exactly what happens with Bi-Rite. It wasn't so bad...once you had the ice cream. Also, we had to deal with some Orange County bitches (they MUST'VE come all the way from SoCal to piss me off, otherwise I have no idea who these fucking people thought they were) who with their pearls and wrinkled botoxed skin had to hold up the entire line and then merge into the second line which was JUST to pay and cut in front of several people and then conveniently say "oh I'm sorry did I cut in front of you my bad" and then just stay there. You evil bitches. Take your fat babies and die. Choke on that ice cream! You have tainted the vibe! *foams at mouth*

(What happens when Bi-Rite reaches 9999 reviews?) I feel so unfaithful! I pledged forever love to salted caramel! But I've finally tried the Brown Sugar, Ginger, & Caramel Swirl that Gordon, Rick, and Bora rave about. It is indeed as delicious as they say and my heart has wandered! (I have to confess....I even ate it for breakfast the other day....haha. Don't pretend you haven't had something just as ridiculous for breakfast!!!) I also tried the ricanella (snickerdoodle) and while it was good, I think the flavor of cinnamon can be overpowering so that if you have two flavors in your cup, you might not taste the other flavor as well. My cousin keeps ordering the Ritual coffee flavor every time he comes even though the coffee keeps him up at night...he thinks it's worth it. My brother's favorite is the roasted banana. My brother and I are already plotting to go back and get more. Maybe we will go when there isn't a long line and there's less pressure to decide what flavors to get.

The ice cream here lives up to the hype.  I'm typically averse to hype, especially when it requires having to stand in the freezing cold at 10pm for over 40 minutes to get ice cream.  The moment you finally reach the doorway and can read the menu, it's quite a rush.  I mean, how can flavors such as: malted vanilla with peanut brittle, roasted banana, toasted coconut, and salted caramel not get you excited? I dug into my creamy combo of salted caramel and toasted coconut ice cream and the world paused for just a delicious second.  It was rich, flavorful, creamy yet textured, and absolutely one of my most enjoyable ice cream moments.  I didn't want to stop eating it.  And I realized that I would have stood in that 40 minute line in the freezing cold time and time again - if it meant a scoop of my Bi-Rite ice cream. Luckily for the Bi-Rite ice cream lover, you can take home pints of your favorite flavors at either the ice cream shop or Bi-Rite grocery store a few stores down the street.  I'm a new super fan!

After a few visits to this wildly popular creamery I finally got here early enough before they ran out of the highly praised salted caramel flavor which had eluded me on every visit prior to this one.  Still, while waiting in line I was a bit anxious and nervous that by the time I got to the front of the line they would have, of course, run out. I ordered a small cup with a scoop of salted caramel and recanelas (cinnamon ice cream w/ snickerdoodle pieces) and the two delicious flavors complemented each other quite well. Also love their cookies n' cream and enjoy the mint chip flavor too.  Friendly and helpful staff. __________ A scoop of salted caramel and a scoop of malted vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate pieces is my new favorite combo here!  Love it.

Oh, quite the yummy in gourmet ice cream.... this go 'round was some salted caramel, roasted banana, and honey lavender, shared by 3. Um.... *this* was gone in 60 seconds!

It is not often that we experience a moment of true, uninterrupted bliss.  Off the top of my head, I can name somethings: -putting on clothes fresh off the dryer during cold weather -vegging out in the shower until the hot water runs out or you are red as a lobster and your skin is tender to touch...whichever comes first -the moment you see your armour walk out of the gate at SFO -dropping a deuce after holding it to a point where your butt cheeks can no longer hold back the flood -bi-rite salted caramel ice cream For the past years, I have heard people talk about this place like it is the holy pilgrimage to Mecca.  For an ice cream parlor, only two flavors have ever come out of their mouths: honey  lavender and salted caramel.  I like ice cream but am not a maniac about it.  I questioned myself on how good this ice cream can possibly taste.  Ice cream all tastes the same to me unless it is some sugar free bullshit. Anyways,  I came here for dessert with ebenezer after lunch at bi-rite market.  I ordered the single scoop cup and got salted caramel and ginger caramel swirl while the object of numerous assignations got the honey lavender and some orange flavor.  First thing first, they don't give you spoon.  They give you a wooden stick, much like the compressors they place on your tongue to check your tonsils.  This creamery is legit.  This clip sums it up perfectly: http://www.youtube.com/w….  If you are lazy, it is .46-1:08.  And if you are even lazier, the quote is, "once it hits your lips.....it's so good".   Once the salted caramel touched the tongue, I was transported to a land of fairies and sprites, lovingly tossing their pixie dust at any wayward soul in gayish delight.  The salted caramel was so good that it was indescribable.  A fellow yelper said it tasted like the top part of a creme brulee....no...that description does not do it justice...there is simply no way to describe it.  It was the best ice cream I ever had.  It was so good that it managed to mute the ginger caramel flavor.  I ate it with such disgust, hating myself for not ordering 2 scoops of salted caramel.  I sampled a bit of my girlfriend's cup and to be quite honest, the honey lavender was underwhelming.  It was good and had a very delicate taste, but i felt that I was eating potpourri.  Her orange flavor was super intense in flavor, however, I am not that big on orange ice cream.   Bi-Rite definitely made me a believer.  One scoop of salted caramel can make you float, or at least your innards anyways.  Don't come here expecting a Fentons experience.  You will not get a softball sized scoop, but a dainty one.  This place is not Baskin Robbins nor is it Dryers.  If you say so with conviction, I will punch you square in the nose, along with Ruggy J.  I am glad I do not have to embark on a Hajj and go to Saudia Arabia; the pilgrimage is only at short distance to Delores.

Seriously there is nothing new I can add about Bi-Rite that has not already been said. I mean you can pass by at any given time (during their hours of operation) and you can pretty much expect to see a ridiculous wait regardless of weather, time and day. We happen to pass by the other night on our way home and saw that the line was less than ten people long so we parked and stood in line. It took us about 10-15 minutes from the time of arrival and by the time we got to the cash register.  We must have arrived during the "eye of the storm" because the line was trailed out toward the end of the block by the time we were leaving with our ice cream and a bag of THE BEST gluten free macaroons I have ever tasted. My Earl Grey Tea and salted caramel was seriously the best way to wrap up the end of the long day of driving and running errands.

How can you spot a poppin' ice cream parlor?!? The line! I tried coming here a couple months ago and the line was super long. That was a red flag that this place lives up to its popularity. Winter in the bay is pretty cold and when I saw the line I told myself next I'm in SF, I must try! So attempt #2 was a success! Granted there was still a line running down the street but the wait was well worth it. The Green Tea is MmmmmMmGoood. None of that artificial green powder taste nor is it extra creamy. The Chocolate Coconut is just as good. Chocolaty with a hint of coconut. Can the two flavors compliment each other any better?!   Bi-Rite Creamery I'm already having withdraw symptoms =(

My trip to Bi-Rite was so amazing that I insisted my sister take a photo of me in front of the menu outside afterwards, in which I look maniacal with happiness.  The gentleman at the counter was lovely, offering spoon upon spoon of samples and telling us his recommendations.  I went with one of his recommendations, brown sugar with caramel and ginger swirl, along with malted vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate.   Like so many businesses in SF, Bi-Rite really seems to take pride in using quality, mostly organic ingredients.  When, oh when, will this modus operandi take hold in NY?  The ice cream is incredible-- creamy, complex flavors, natural tasting... and on an aesthetic note, just perfect looking in a cone.  My favorite dessert of our trip!

I think that Bi-Rite Creamery makes excellent ice cream, just not the swoon-I'm-having-a-foodgasm-and-I-can-die-a-happy-­person type of ice cream.  Their ice cream is great, but I think that I expected a lot more (perhaps a bit unfairly), based on all the rapturous reviews on Yelp.   Going on a weekday afternoon is the best way to avoid lines- we pretty much had the whole place to ourselves when we went.  The salted caramel was definitely going to be one of the flavors we got- after all, all these Yelpers can't be wrong, right?  Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed.  While good, I think that the salted caramel was a little too salty.  The caramel flavor was delicious and complex, but less salt would have made it perfect.  We also tried the honey lavender, the roasted banana, and the malted vanilla with nuts.  The honey lavender tasted too much of lavender- it didn't seem balanced with the honey.  I would have preferred a more subtle lavender flavor.  The roasted banana was deemed the favorite of the four flavors, though I think the banana flavor could have been punched up a bit.  The malted vanilla was quite good and was a close second to the banana. We also got a package of the toffee chip cookies- good, but I think they would have been much more awesome if the cookies were heated (The toffee was a little hard.).  That way the toffee chips would have been melted and gooey-the cookies would then be perfect for dipping into ice cream. Bi-Rite is a little out of the way for me, so coming back would be a result of being in the area and craving ice cream.  The parking situation is pretty horrible, even on a weekday, and its best to bring the smallest car possible, so that you can fit into the spaces.  Bi-Rite does make some of the freshest tasting ice creams I've had and I really applaud their enviromental consciousnesss (compostable spoons and cups, organic ingredients), but I just wish that the ice cream flavors blew me away as they did other Yelpers.

Now most people seem to go for fancy wedding cakes, or the faddish fountain, but we wanted an ice cream cake from Bi-Rite Creamery. No one's protest of "It's going to melt" would deter us. Bi-Rite thought it was a great idea. We had the place to ourselves for our early morning appointment. The woman who was helping us gave us samples of every flavor ice cream we could possibly have desired. Unfortunately, no actual ice cream cake. Even though their catering menu clearly specified their prices, I was braced for a shake-down when we mentioned the magic word caters love to hear: "wedding". The prices were the same no matter the occasion. We ended up getting 2 half sheets (so it'd be easier to stick in the restaurants walk-in), plus a little round for our table. We had seasonal balsamic strawberry and a number of other flavors. Sadly, the servers at our wedding didn't know what they were handing people. But our friends and family ate it up anyway. We got no less than a dozen compliments (there were only 50 people). People loved it! What was really awesome is that without telling us, Bi-Rite decorated our little round in a festive way. Plus, they were stuck with our dietary requirements for the decoration as well. Now that's service. So not only do we love to get our scoops on cones here, we can recommend Bi-Rite for your wedding cake. Simply delicious!

Bi-Rite Creamery has been on my list of "to try" eateries for a while now.  As expected, you yelpers know a thing or two about good eats; Bi-rite did not disappoint!  Within seconds of entering Bi-Rite, I got the cozy "old-diner" vibe, which I love.  The flavors are handwritten on the glass and everything is organic and local, a few personal touches that add to the novelty of the creamery.  All the flavors are silky, rich, and creamy - you really can't go wrong with anything that your heart desires.   DO... - Try the salted caramel - best seller for a reason! - Try the coffee toffee if you're a caffeine junkie.  Has a rich coffee flavor to it and tastes like actual coffee beans in the ice cream. - Try the Ricanelas - cinnamon with snickerdoodles.  My favorite of the trip!  Makes eating your ice cream like a treasure hunt looking for the tasty cookie morsels mixed into the ice cream. DON'T... - Feel bad asking for samples to decide on what you want (unless of course there's a huge line of people glaring at you).  Kudos to Bi-Rite for being green and using metal spoons for tastings. - Be deceived by the small cups! I got 2 scoops so I could enjoy two different flavors, and was so full by the last bite.   - Get discouraged by a long line.  It's moves pretty fast.   Decent prices for a gourmet ice cream experience!  I will definitely be back when my sweet tooth cravings hit!

Ok I now know why Mariah Carey chose to sing a song about Honey...she must have had the Honey Lavender ice cream at Bi-Rite of course! Here I am, sitting at my desk with no sweets in site just thinking about it. I look out the window, oh dear it is only 3 bart stations away. WHY? And for that matter why can't it be 5 o'clock yet? But it's not just the flavors at Bi-Rite that get me going, it's the ultimate creaminess of the ice cream itself. They don't call it a 'creamery' for nothing, and believe me it gets you real creamy - ok, maybe not, but it is def. foodgasm worthy. Strauss organic cream can do that to you. Try making whipped cream with Strauss and clover and bam, you'll know. Now imagine how much better that makes the ice cream! Whether or not it's better than Mitchell's has long been debated. I personally like Mitchell's coconut ice cream, so I could never scratch Mitchell's, no way. But there must be a reason all my friends go to Bi-Rite....There must be a reason people sit around on couches dreaming about their Salted Caramel (that's my second favorite). There must be something going on I swear it's the cream.

Came back on the 4th of July. Was expecting much longer line, only had to wait about 15 minutes. Ordered the balsamic strawberry (again because lets be honest, its amazing) but switched it up alittle with the brown sugar which was super yummy. The brown sugar was alittle overpowering with the strawberry but that was my fault, I just got too excited. For 5 of us (each with two scoops) total was $16. Yum yum yum.

YUUUUUMMMMM.... I'm an off and on ice cream fan.  I used to not keep ice cream at home because I'd go through the entire carton in 1 sitting.  But now my boyfriend is a big ice cream lover so I keep it around to appease him. What was my point?  Oh yeah, I don't eat ice cream much.  But I am a fan.  Especially when the flavors pop like they do at Bi-Rite. I like how there are about 30 flavors for you to try.  There's bound to be a couple in those 30 choices that you find interesting.  For me, there were 3 or 4.  I ended up trying earl grey, coffee toffee, and pumpkin pie.  All 3 flavors were DELICIOUS, but I opted to get the earl grey and coffee toffee kuz, well, coffee and tea - what better duo is there? I am a HUGE fan of coffee ice cream.  It's my favorite flavor, probably because I'm a recovering coffee addict.  Bi-Rite's coffee ice cream definitely did not disappoint.  I loved how it had a lot of coffee flavor, without all the sugar that a lot of ice cream places like to pack in all of their ice creams. (I drink my coffee with cream, not sugar, so I'm not a fan of the sweet coffee flavor)  This coffee toffee paired perfectly with the earl grey, which was super flavorful but very light at the same time.  I still don't know how that's possible, but somehow, Bi-Rite figured it out. Anyway, I thought their scoops were way too small, probably because I loved my 2 flavors.  I tried the bf's cookies and cream and salted caramel - didn't like the cookies and cream, and salted caramel, while flavorful, wasn't exactly my favorite flavor.  Maybe a little too salty for my tastes.

Without the line this place would easily be a 5 star ice cream shoppe.  Bi-Rite does it right and their flavors are incredible.  Simple and unique ice creams tantalize every sensation making you want more.  Get a sundae and it's large enough to share... but you wont want to.  you've been warned. the latest craze is the coffee toffee ice cream.  Check it out.

Well. I was spoiled at a very young age by working at the best ice cream place in the world, with the best boss ever (Screamin' Mimi's in Sebastopol... absolutely worth the drive), so any ice cream I've had since I was 15 has had a LOT to live up to. I wouldn't even eat Ben and Jerry's for years. So, I really like the whole idea of Bi-Rite, but, for me, it didn't live up to the hype. I am obsessed with sweet & salty together, so I loved the idea of salted caramel ice cream, but honestly, it really wasn't that impressive to me. Sam's Sundae was also an interesting concept, with the salt and olive oil and chocolate, but it didn't work for me. Not bad, just not what I was hoping for, I guess. They do get points for using biodegradable spoons and cups.

Best ice cream, worst clientele.  I thought I was the only one who noticed the ridiculous attitude factor there.  I want to tell those terrible Marina Whores to take their 400 dollar sweaters and drive their BMW's off a cliff!  I hate them and loudly proclaim it every time I enter this store... you should too!  Drive them back into their mansions!  They don't belong here! That should tell you how good the ice cream is, that I would endure such disgusting displays of wealth and attitude for it. ... and about the ice cream:  it's super-good, uses Straus cream, which is super-green, and the staff is super-nice, especially considering the stuck-up cunts they have to endure day in and day out.

Tried the Mexican vegan chocolate ice cream, that was killer and this coconut one too, both went really well together.

Aside from waiting in line for 15+minutes everything was good about this place!!!  The flavors are innovative, the taste superb and the people working there were very patient and helpful. I had the salted caramel and it was a full of flavor, salty and sweet.  I also had the Cinnamon w/ snickerdoodle, yum!!  My sis had the creme fraiche and she loved it.  I also sampled a few flavors and my favs were the balsamic strawberry & toasted coconut,  Moreover, the prices were pretty decent, I paid $3.25 for a cone and 2 scoops.  This is definitely one of my favorite ice cream places in the city!

The name Bi-Rite makes me think of the 25 cent ice cream we used to get at our neighborhood Thrifty drug store. But Bi-Rite is no 25 cent ice cream store, no siree! As the line will tell you, this place makes amazing ice cream. Interesting flavors but nothing too bizarre (see my Humphry Slocombe review). There's something for everyone.  I ordered a double scoop of roasted banana & ricanelas. I loved the bits of snickerdoodle cookie in the ice cream. What a great idea! I also tried a lick or 2 of the salted caramel (very strong creme brulee flavor-YUM) & ginger (not too gingery, just right!). They were all amazing. Unfortunately 2 in our group of 6 decided not to partake in the yumminess (party poopers!) otherwise I would have tried theirs, too. Come to Bi-Rite, get a few scoops, & enjoy the people watching outside.

So at the recommendation of a few Nor Cal natives, we came here around 10 pm on a Saturday night on the spur of the moment to kill some time and try out this place out. We had plans lined up later that night, so we just wanted a quick dessert pit stop. So there we were about to arrive, and as we were turning the corner, we saw a huge line for Bi-Rite that was literally out the door. All this on a chilly Saturday night in the SF! Disappointment... Heartbreak... So we find an illegal parking spot across the street, and spend 10 minutes debating whether or not it was worth it to wait outside in the cold for the ice cream. Then, as I was eyeing the long line in longing and in jealousy, I suddenly saw the Bi-Rite Creamery to-go stand, about two storefronts down from the actual store.... It was as if both fate and divine intervention intervened! So what did we do next? We risked our lives jaywalking across the street at 10:30 pm, waited in line for a glorious 5 minutes, and ate a PINT of EARL GREY ICE CREAM in the comfort of a Honda CRV. Was it worth it? Damn right it was.... Down to every last bite of the every last penny of the $7.99 I paid. As a self-proclaimed tea lover, the Earl Grey Ice Cream is exactly what you would imagine - Earl Grey milk tea frozen in a pint of ice cream goodness. IT WAS AMAZING. A taste of heaven, almost - it tastes exactly like Earl Grey tea, but it's not too sweet, and it definitely hits the spot. So for my first business venture after I make millions of dollars of course, I intend on using the concept of tea flavors (conventional and unconventional) and making ice cream flavors out of them. Yes, I have it patented already, so don't try to jip my brilliant idea.

Holy salted caramel ice cream, Batman!  A friend took me to Bi-Rite Creamery after having dinner in the Mission.  As we approached, she said, there it is, Bi-Rite.  I said, what's it called?  Bi-Rite, she said.  Bi-Rite?  I asked again.  The name of this place sounds to me like a convenience store on the East Coast. Lucky for me, they do not sell what convenience stores sell.  The line outside almost went around the corner of the street.  If they were selling something they actually had to cook, like meat on a stick or dumplings swimming in MSG soup, the wait would probably have been at least half an hour.  Good thing all they had to do was scoop. Once inside the store itself, I eyed the menu and decided on two scoops in one cone, with the salted caramel ice cream and the brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl ice cream.  The brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl was tasty, but the salted caramel was easily some of the best ice cream I have ever tasted.

Yup, this place is legit. Try the ricanella (sp?) or brown sugar. Both were amazing! Love how you can get a single size but get 2 diff flavors (aka 2 scoops). I think they recently expanded too so there's tables to sit down. If you're not in the mood for the most awesome ice cream ever!!!!...there's always their frozen yogurt window just a few steps away. When I went, they had 3 flavors - vanilla, chocolate and...crap, I don't remember. Well, it doesn't matter b/c you won't be coming to Bi-Rite for the yogurt...you'll be waiting in that long ass line to get a scoop of salted caramel or coffee or butter pecan or...you get the picture. Oh and they even have a vegan flavor (But can't imagine it would be very good..just sayin).

Bi-Rite Creamery's salted caramel ice cream is #35 on the 2010 Big Eat SF List. (http://www.7x7.com/eat-d…) It puts all other salted caramels to shame. To be honest, I'd overdosed on the salted caramel trend lately. Wouldn't even have tasted it if it wasn't listed on the Big Eat SF list. This salted caramel was a smoky, dark burnt-caramel taste with the faintest sway of salt underneath. Other yelpers have commented on the competition from Molly Moons. Not even a comparison. As bubble gum ice cream is to french vanilla, Molly's salted caramel is to Bi-Rite's. Perfect follow-up to some pizza from Delfina's, just down the block.

I tried the honey lavender, salted caramel, and the balsamic strawberry. All of them were excellent, but my pick is the salted caramel. I make my own ice cream at home and have tried making the strawberry and salted caramel. The flavor was similar but something but the richness of of Bi-Rite's ice cream can't be reproduced. Pro-tip: If there's a huge line and you're with friends, just grab a pint to go at the window down the street or at the Bi-Rite market.

The ice cream here is so good!! I'm not usually a big fan of ice cream since I prefer fro-yo, but I'd definitely pick Bi-rite over most fro-yo places.  I've tried a few flavors, but I always come back to the salted caramel.  Mmmmm~   While you're in the area you should make a stop at Tartine bakery for their banana cream tart.  I think these are my two favorite dessert spots in SF. The only downside is the horrible parking, but it's worth it!

Look for a place with a line wrapped around the corner, bubbled out here and there to accommodate the sleeping homeless people along the wall. That's it, that's the one. Bi-Rite Creamery is pretty popular and with good reason. Their ice cream is well worth any trip you made to get it (in the case of my party, practically walking from Fisherman's Wharf). Since the pricing is pretty much 1-2 scoops for the same price, I got Honey Lavender and Ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodle). I couldn't help but savor it slowly enjoying the rich flavors which also seemed to cleanse the palette all at once. Honey Lavender reminded me of warm vanilla lavender cookies and the flavor brought me home. Think Ego's sudden remembrance of being a boy while eating Remy's dish and all of the comfort it brought in "Ratatouille." The taste is simply love.

Hot May evening. Stomach full of tapas. Must have ice cream! We arrived after 9pm to a line out the door and down the block! Ugh. But when you're in line with good company, it moves fast! I was excited to try the Salted Caramel. But by the time we got to the front of the line, they ran out! :( Had a double scoop of Roasted Banana and Creme Fraiche. Topped with the sel de caramel topping. Roasted Banana was REALLY GOOD. VERY refreshing! I was VERY surprised! Creme Fraiche was ok. $5 for creamy goodness! Knock one star for the long line and running out of flavors...But, we'll be back again to try the salted caramel!

It was a weds night  we decided to go try this ice cream place that everyone has been talking about. it was 10pm! the line wrapped around the corner and it was friggin cold!! perhaps after the 30 min wait and after my limbs have lost circulation due to frost bites, I was thinking.. this BETTER be good!  I didn't think the ice cream was all that! it was regular ice cream to me. Don't get me wrong, ice cream is good just cause its ice cream but I was expecting so much more........ with that wait, I was hoping I'd find gold nuggets in the ice cream or something! but I didn't.

**UPDATE** 9/28/07 Tuesday was, like, the hottest day of the year. How do I know this? I had a serious hankering for some ice cream. Only happens once a year and usually as Indian Summer drops the heat bomb that should'a happened in August. Double parked, ran in, got myself a double scoop (it was THAT hot outside) of salted caramel and white chocolate raspberry swirl, and was out the door in under 5 minutes. It was the best hot weather treat EVER!  Salted caramel, people. Holy shit!! *********** I'm not an ice cream person. Don't be so shocked! I'm not. Never have been. It was sort of a problem for my family who LOVED the stuff. I mean, it's not that I don't LIKE ice cream, I just would never really go out of my way to get it or eat it. Or wait in a long line for it.  I mean, if you put it in front of me, like, on top of a cobbler or something I'll eat it and enjoy it...I don't know what it is... Bi-Rite Creamery may have changed all of that. Seriously. Their lavender-honey ice cream is the loveliest, creamiest, most delightful frozen cream I've ever tasted. It was elegant and decadent and just plain good! Like I imagine ice cream should be! Really effin' good! Maybe-I'll-wait-in-line-myself-next-time-good! Well...that might be pushing it. Fortunately, I have people for that.

After hailing Bi-Rite ice cream and the quality of the goodness that goes into each delectable serving to co-workers at a company BBQ, I had no choice but to order the Sundae Party Kit when it was time to do an Ice Cream Social for the company. Bi-Rite Creamery didn't disappoint.  I ordered the delicious handpacked quarts of Vanilla, Honey Lavender and Salted Caramel for the three Straus Family Dairy flavors in addition to the Soy Chocolate and Plum Sorbet for any Vegetarians/Vegans who may not eat dairy. They completely set us up with more than enough biodegradable bowls and spoons (corn-based, I believe) as well as organic blueberries, toasted almonds, hot fudge, hot caramel, brownie bites, whipped cream and sprinkles.   It was a hit and the leftovers were minimal.  I found out that the coffee lovers can always use the whipped cream and caramel in their morning caffeine rituals.   Personally, the only negative that I had was the aftertaste of lavender in my mouth ALL day (think: soap).

I'm gonna' say it's overrated. I like ice cream as much as the next girl but I even the salt caramel flavor that everybody raves about seemed flat. I like the idea of a little independent ice cream place but the their selection of flavors didn't impress me too much. The people who worked there were nice and quick but I don't think there's a reason to wait in line for a dairy treat. I can grab a Klondike bar or Nestle's cone for less money and time. In fact I'd rather do business with the guys who push around a little, white, belled cart with a wide selection of frozen goodies. Actually I'd rather have the ice cream man come down my block in his spectacular, ice cream truck! Hmmmm, maybe I want to be the ice cream girl! I'll wear a push up bra and sell push up pops; I'll be more successful than anyone! hahaha!

OVERRATED! I had been looking forward to going to Bi-Rite for quite some time.  All the damn food snobs that I know always rave about the place.  However, upon finally getting over there today for a mid-afternoon taste, I was disappointed to learn that the hype is much greater than the ice cream itself. Miraculously, the line was not too long (I have driven by many times to see a much longer line).  I had hoped to try banana since banana is the measuring stick by which I judge all ice cream places.  Unfortunately, they were out.  Instead, it would have to be a single cone with Orange Cardamom and Honey Lavender.  I was put off at how ridiculous and food snob-esque some of the flavors were, so I figured I had to try them.   The flavors themselves were actually okay.  However, to me, the ice cream experience is half flavor, and half texture.  The texture of this ice cream is terrible.  There is way too much ice in the ice cream.  You can feel the ice crystals.  It's as if you just dug out an old carton from inside your freezer that had all the freezerburn ice crystals forming on the surface of the ice cream.  Not good - I usually throw that ice cream away.  Instead, at Bi-Rite, you can get a tiny portion of it at a price appropriate for a serving twice what you get. If you want good ice cream, stick to Mitchell's.  You can't go wrong.  Bi-Rite isn't worth it.

Not sure what the hype was about, I asked a friend, which lead us to come here after dinner. Even then, with us wrapped in our jackets shivering, we stood in line to order ice cream. The staff was really friendly and funny. She found out it was my first time and gave me a bunch of samples to try. I really liked the strawberry balsamic, salted caramel, malted vanilla with peanut brittles, and ricanelas. Their ice cream is smooth and flavorful. I ended up with the coffee toffee and malted vanilla with peanut brittles. I think I have popped my bi rite cherry now!!! Who wants to come with me next time?!?!

Line at Ike's: Rarely worth it Line at Badlands: Never worth it Line at Chinese embassy by my house: Not really sure what's going on Line at Bi-Rite: Totally worth it Chances are, if you live in SF, you've been to Bi-Rite. It's a (pardon the pun) Rite of passage, so to speak. I was introduced to Bi-Rite on one of my first nights living in SF, and what better way to celebrate moving to a cold and strange new city than by trying a few cold and strange ice cream flavors. When I say strange, I don't mean like Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans... but strange as in flavors you don't normally see at an ice cream shop. I have returned many, many times in my years here, despite the fact that it isn't exactly close to my neighborhood.

When I moved here from Atlanta, I was sad that I would no longer get to enjoy the delicious salted caramel ice cream at Morelli's. Well guess what? Bi-Rite puts Morelli's TO SHAME. The salted caramel here is my favorite, along with what seems like half of San Francisco. It's sweet, savory, and just salted enough without feeling like a fake flavor. The line can sometimes be a bit extreme, so if you get here early enough, just walk across the street to the Bi-Rite grocery and buy a pint. Grab a couple of spoons, a blanket, and head to Dolores Park. Quintessential SF. Pro Tip: Make sure to get a punch card. I've managed to fill mine up and get a free ice cream within the first couple of months of living here. Good for my wallet, not so good for my waistline.

Bi-Rite's ice cream is okay but i am giving them 4 stars because they have unique flavors (Balsamic Lavender, Cinnamon with Snicker doodles, Roasted Bananas and etc). The line can be out the door but the quick service makes the wait just 5 minutes are less. Seriously, what is consider GOOD ice cream? Maybe I'm just not an ice cream person because ill eat ice cream from Polly Ann's or even Baskin Robbins. But if you are in the mood for something different or around the neighborhood, check out Bi-Rite. PS. Parking can be a biotchh......

Just had a customized ice cream cake from Bi-Rite last night .... and let me tell you... WOOOOOOOOOWWWW.  I've never tasted any kind of cake like that!  My friend chose this cake based off of someone else's birthday cake that they tried 2 weeks prior.   The cake from top to bottom:  Ricanela icecream with snickerdoodle cookie dough, banana ice cream, gingerbread cake crust.  The cake wasn't too sweet at all.  ALL the flavors complimented each other sooo well.  Even banana ice cream haters LOVED this cake.  The banana flavor wasn't too overbearing.  It was a nice hint of banana creaminess.  I'm not a fan of cookie dough ice cream... but this snickerdoodle cookie dough was amazing.  It was nice and crunchy and added a lot of flavor to it.  We got a 8" cake, good for 10-12 people... and for the 8 people that were eating this cake, there was only 1/7 of the cake left... It was THAT good.  Even through my diet, I caved in and went for the 2nd slice. =D  Must try an ice cream cake sometime.  If you plan on customizing a cake, order it 3-4days in advance. Also have been here for the ice cream a while back.  Yes, the lines get pretty long... but the lines go by pretty fast.  Blame all the people asking for samples (like me ;) ).  There were WAY too many flavors that I had no idea about... much less knew what they would taste like.  Lavender?  Salted Caramel??  All sounds soooo weird!  But to my surprise, they were both very good!  The Lavender does taste like a flower tho!  I did try a million samples to make sure I got the right flavors =P  I ended up with the salted caramel and i can't remember the other one.   The pricing for ice cream here is decent, not TOO overly priced, but I guess pretty avg for ice cream shops around SF.  The portions were small though... but still worth a try!

Hipsters in hoodies mulled around contemplating which flavor combo would broadcast their street-cred to others as they leisurely licked. Just then came an announcement from behind the counter: "Free upgrade to anyone who knows EXACTLY what they want!" "I'm ready" I replied and was soon enjoying the rich creamy goodness of the roasted banana in a waffle cone. I got the hook-up and of a double at the single scoop price. Nice!

I was never the girl who dreamed of what her wedding day would be like.   The dress, the flowers, the venue - I did not spend years envisioning all these things.  Except for one thing: THE CAKE.  If I got married, I knew one thing for sure: I wanted an ice cream wedding cake! Well, I did get married, and my fiance-now-husband proved that he was perfect for me by totally being into the idea of having an ice cream wedding cake.  That was actually the first wedding decision we made.  And given that we had enjoyed Bi-Rite so many times - and had gotten a brochure from them outlining their reasonable cake prices - the decision to get a cake there was made. It couldn't have been easier.  I gave them a call and explained what we wanted: just a simple ice cream cake to feed fifty people.  It could be a plain sheet cake - we were absolutely not expecting anything fancy - no tiered concoction for us.  We made an appointment to come in and sample some flavors (yum!).  We ended up deciding on two half sheet cakes - one yellow cake with Balsamic Strawberry and Ricanela, the other a chocolate cake with Mint Chip Ice Cream.  We also decided to do a small round "Bride and Groom" cake, with Balsamic Strawberry and Ricanela ice cream and gingerbread cake.  We weren't expecting much in the way of decoration - the sheet cakes would be cut up in the kitchen at the reception and served to guests, and the round cake - well, Bi-Rite said that they'd pretty it up since it would be photographed, but really, we just wanted a cake that tasted good. The day before our wedding, we went to Bi-Rite to pick up the cakes (they don't deliver).    Much to our surprise and delight, our round cake was GORGEOUS - it was piled high with strawberries and shards of white chocolate.  It looked absolutely wonderful (no need for a cake topper!).  We put them on dry ice and drove them 1/2 hour to our reception site.   The cakes were a big hit!  I think all our guests had multiple slices.   One of the best parts: the cost.  The three cakes were totally within our budget.   I love Bi-Rite all the more now - not only do they make great ice cream, but they made us a beautiful, memorable wedding cake!

Love everything about Bi Rite so bad! The line looks really intimidating, but trust me it goes fast (and even if it didn't it's totally worth the wait). I can't wait to see the expansion...which was set to be unveiled today! I love the decor on the inside and out. The giant pink ice cream cone is a super cute touch. Last time I was here I split a do-it-yourself sundae with a friend, which was a wise choice because A. it was delicious B. I was stuffed after eating half, but know I would have continued eating the other half if I wasn't sharing because it. is. that. good. We got two flavors: toasted coconut and salted caramel with hot fudge and I think toasted almonds? I don't remember for sure because I was in such ice cream bliss.

The guy behind the counter smiled and waved at us so as to give us attention and prepare us on our ice cream adventure! Creme Fraiche and Roasted Banana single... amazing! The Creme Fraiche is nothing you can exactly describe or compare.  It's a type of sweet freshness that soothes with every scoop / chomp / lick of creamy goodness.   The Roasted Banana, on the other hand, is almost strange... in a fantastic sort of way.  I'm usually not a huge fan of banana ice creams, but this one fits the bill of any exception you might have to consider.  It's not just your average banana flavor... it's a ROASTED banana flavor... a taste you can MOST DEFINITELY distinguish. 5 Stars

Families rolling up in their Volvo SUVs. A line files out the door.  Standing just outside the doors is what appears to be a homeless, crackhead holding a Bi-Rite ice cream cone and eating it like...like...like it was crack.  She's addicted. I can tell by the fire in her eyes and the fervor in the way she licks away at the sweet sensations.  She walks away satiated. She'll be back for another fix. *** I'm so glad I got a chance to get my fill on the yummiest brown butter pecan ice cream EVER!  It was smooth. It was creamy. It was perfectly sweetened! It was gone in minutes.  I'm addicted. I'll be back for another fix.

It was like taking a bite out of frozen perfection. The toasted coconut ice cream is sublime (particularly paired with either the orange cardamom or the salted caramel). And if you haven't tried the cinnamon ice cream with chunks of snickerdoodle you are seriously missing out.

You scream, we scream, we all scream for ice cream.  Had to see what all the hype was about, this line out the door down the block?  Why folks are really into this place?  Yes It was good...nice creamy consistency, unique flavors like Chai spiced chocolate and Balsamic Strawberry, organic ingredients used on the billing/ packaging.   Maybe it's the retro signage, the fancy neo architecture or the benches with the Palm Trees out front that made you feel like you were in eating ice cream in Miami, maybe just a whole packaging of that...  It was good I'll admit, It just didn't "scream" enough for me, I'm not jumping up and down over it like everybody else,  $2.50-ish for a single scoop serving, maybe I'm just old fashioned or opinionated when it comes to gourmet junk food.  Not bad... just not all "that" to me. UPDATE: 8/6/2007: Up 2 more stars from the original review.  Initially I was going to try each flavor and bump the star rating as I was "wowed" by each flavor...WELL!  I just had the Salted Carmel and WOW! I was ready to slap somebodies mother in line behind me it was soooo gooood!  Okay now I get all this 5 star rating hub-bub...well deserved Bi- Rite creamery,  Yelpers know their shyte!

i finally tried the regular ice cream.  The Sam's Sundae was an experience.  the rest of the flavors are just ok.  even the fabled salted caramel was good for 2 bites...but then it got old. Sadly, i prefer the banana ice cream from Coldstone's.  I don't even like Coldstone's.

Until recently, Salted Caramel was the tune I sang from the end of the line to Bi-Rite Creamery's cash register. Then I met Brown Butter Pecan, and SC now has been pushed to the top of the scoops-in-a-bowl composition. That way I can visit Brown Butter periodically between licks and spoonfuls of unctuously-sweet Salted Caramel and then end on the high note of nutty-sweet cream and buttery-soft pecans. Notice the switch between subject and adjective? Apart from the exquisite flavor experience, the ice cream has time to be sensationally and poetically symbiotic. Perf. And I think the fact that my two favorite flavors from Bi-Rite Creamery manage to make butter the star of already-sinful ice cream speaks volumes for both parties involved. Last words: may punch cards rule the world forever and ever.

There is something very bad ass about sitting outside, the night before a storm, unabashedly eating full fat ice cream. If you're going to eat rich food, it has to be enjoyed and savored. It has to be decadent. I had brown sugar caramel ginger ice cream (I hope I got the word order right). I didn't take it back to the apartment, either. I sat right there in front of God and everyone and enjoyed my ice cream. San Francisco, are you trying to seduce me?

Ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles) is where it is AT. Honestly crap that is good. I thought the salted caramel was good, but not fantastic. Granted, I was spoiled by delish caramello al sale gelato in Italy for 3 years, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. I also am a huge fan of cookies and cream and Bi-Rite NAILED it. Yum. Yum.

It was my first time there & so the guy offered me several different flavors, everything tasted good. I ended up ordering a brownie sundae and it was the best I have ever tasted. Absolutely the best ice cream I have ever had & I'll definitely be back when I am in SF again. There was a line outside but the wait was not bad. Definitely worth the wait.

After a violently spicy Ethiopian dinner tempered by ambrosial honey wine, my friend and I headed to the famous Bi-Rite to see what all the fuss was about. When we saw the line, we knew were in for a treat. It extended to the end of the block, with the typical San Francisco motley crew of yuppies, hipsters, and weirdos. Frankly, the discussions with various members of the line was legitimate entertainment in itself and made it go quickly. Despite the crowds, when we got to the counter we couldn't resist trying all of the exotically conceived flavors. Brown Butter Pecan? Ricanelas (cinnamon with Snickerdoodles)? Balsamic Strawberry? I am no stranger to *unusual* flavors such as "corn sorbet" at New York's Cones, but these flavors sound like Willy Wonka got into Timothy Leary's secret stash. Fortunately, the flavor combinations themselves are brilliantly executed, with Brown Butter Pecan being an especial favorite of mine. However, the texture of the ice cream leaves a lot to be desired. There is a vague chalkiness to the texture which I believe is due to miniature ice chunks, as I felt several larger pieces of ice which became even more obvious as the ice cream quickly softened in the cup. These texture deficiencies were aggravating enough to warrant a 2-star deduction, although I think I may be judging particularly harshly due to Bi-Rite's peerless reputation.

I'm watching Food Network and see Bi-Rite Creamery featured on the show "The Best Thing I Ever Ate."  Of course, I have to try it, and wow, Food Network does not lie as this ice cream ranks high on my "what I want to eat right before I die" list.   Parking can be tough in the city, but boy, will the ice cream here be worth it!  My absolute favorite flavor is Brown Sugar with Caramel Ginger Swirl.  The texture is just so creamy and it's not too sugary.  In other words, its perfect.  I also enjoy the Ricanelas (think snickerdoodle cookie, but with a lot less crunch).   If you are seeking out the best ice cream in San Francisco, go here.  You won't be disappointed!

I feel like I'm the last person on earth to try bi-rite...finally got over there last weekend.  Even though it was a bit chilly, the line was down the block - a good sign in my book.  As I couldn't pick just one flavor, I opted for honey lavender, mexican chocolate and salted caramel.  My friend had a sundae.  We were both in our own personal heavens until he scooped up the last bit of his ice cream and said with a big grin, "Oops, did you want some of this?".  Nice, real nice.  No bonus points for him.   But major bonus points for bi-rite, it's yet another reason to get over to the Mission.

I don't think I am going to write a thorough review. Everything that I wanted to say has already been said. Everything. Read Lori K.'s review; she pretty much sums it up! I will add though that I was tempted to remove a star because of the wait. I am not an impatient person but the line last week was almost around the block! I think they should open another location in the Haight. We're all sooooo very tired of chains (Ben & Jerry, I'm looking at you.) I want exotic flavors like Orange Cardamom and Honey Lavender! Anything that tastes perfumey is yummy to Yum Yum.

Let me just preface this review by stating I'm not an ice cream aficionado nor am I an ice cream snob (well before bi-rite at least!).  Before this place, I just assumed that ice cream was a pretty standard fare dessert.  Sure there was this one time in a bakery in Vittel, France that somehow combined warm fresh baked waffle-like cones with semi-melted ice cream that blended into a delectable treat.  But places like that are more the exception than the rule .  In the US, ice cream is ice cream.  Or so I thought.  Bi-Rite changes all that.  The only thing that is standard at bi-rite is the wait!  Expect to wait in line for at least 15-20 minutes on a spring or summer day.   The flavors at this place are amazing.  Salted Caramel-Yes;Honey Lavender-Yes (and don't knock it till you try it), even the mint chip tasted way better than any other ice cream I've had before.  They have standard flavors for the less adventurous. Don't let the odd name of the restaurant scare you or the sticker shock from your $3.25 mini-bowl of ice cream.  Stand in line and check it out.  The ice cream rocks, the people are nice and the ice cream rocks...did I say that? Call me a snob b/c I'm never going back to Dairy Queen again! jjg

You know when you meet someone who's ridiculously good-looking, so you just assume that she must be dumber than a box of hammers to make up for the blessed genes?  And then... then, she tells you about the research she's doing with her Fulbright Scholarship Award? Bi-Rite is like that.  They're ridiculously good at ice cream.  Everyone seems to agree that Bi-Rite is blessed with long legs and huge knockers.  The thing is, not everyone is aware that Bi-Rite got 2400 on their SATs! And by that I mean, they do cake, too!  Not just ice cream cake, but actual baked, moist, delicious chocolate midnight CAKE! Bi-Rite is no empty-headed one-trick pony who'll let you do shots out of her navel on spring break.

I finally visited Bi-Rite Creamery last month and I have been making a stop here every single time I head over to SF.  The ice cream here is amazing...  It's one of the best that I've ever had in my life.  I go for the Salted Caramel, Ginger, Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl, and Roasted Banana.   I think I'm going to need to switch it up each time I come here but stick to Salted Caramel as my absolute flavor.

Seriously, a 15 person line at 9:30 on a Monday night?  Seriously???  It's not even summer yet guys!! I had to see what all the fuss was about, and I did.  And now I know - The MALT VANILLA W/PEANUT BRITTLE is the bomb.  Like I mean, the super creamy, crunchy  sweetness, honest-to-goodness bomb.   The COFFEE TOFFEE was good, but not to-die-for fantastic.  If this were a video game, I'd go back to my save point and order 2 scoops of malt vanilla w/peanut brittle.   Don't waste your appetite on anything lesser.  Malt vanilla with peanut brittle.  It tastes better than it sounds.  THIS IS YOUR DESTINY!

Came here on an early week day afternoon with no line!  As a result, I didn't have to feel guilty tasting one sample after another.  I really love how they (and Humphry's, and I'm guessing all of SF) use metal spoons  rather than disposable plastic ones when giving out samples.  The woman who worked there was really nice and encouraged us to try as many as we liked.  In the end, we ended up getting four scoops (I think it was $5.75 - pretty darn expensive for four small scoops of ice cream): -Strawberry Balsamic - This had a very mild balsamic taste to it.  I liked it but didn't love it. -Salted Caramel - Everyone raved about this one, so of course I got it.  I liked it, but again, I didn't love it. -Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces - I LOVED THIS ONE!  I am a huge fan of malt in general, and this one was exceptionally malt-y and the peanut brittle gave it a good crunch.   -Ricanelas (Cinnamon with Snickerdoodles) - Another good flavor the comes with actual pieces of snickerdoodle cookie!   Two thumbs up!  Scoops in LA is still my favorite, though, but this is a very close second!

Salted Caramel. If you have cousins saying they wish they had ice cream for lunch only, you know you have a homerun. Don't get chocolate coconut. I didn't try it because I don't like coconut, but everyone with me that got it said it was bad. Ricanellas was awesome. I have never had snicker doodle but I felt I knew exactly what it should taste like after I had this. Brown sugar was also really good and tasted similar to salted caramel but sweeter and with more texture. The sitting area is really small but cute and intimate. I will definitely come back here because their flavors here look insane but together, they made taste perfection.

When you come somewhere twice on a single weekend visit it must be special... That is Bi-Rite Creamery. A recommendation brought me here, and the amazing Salted Caramel brought me back for more the next day when we found ourselves in the area one more time. The Magnolia Coffee Porter, Vegan Coconut Chocolate (damn), and Vanilla Malt are off the chains. While it is a little overpriced, they are in line with typical homemade places. This one is organic though, which is nice. As an over-eater, the portions could definitely be larger: a scoop is actually a small little scoop. Nevertheless, people come here in droves and probably will continue to do so. The line may move faster if it weren't for the required "two sample rule." I appreciate how they use real spoons for said activity, saving millions of plastic spoons from a life in landfills...

4.5 stars I couldn't help but crave ice cream while staring at the crisp blue sky today. And it was fricken meant to be because there was NO LINE at fricken Bi-Rite Creamery. I guess everyone was too busy frolicking in the green across the street. Anyway. Their Malt Vanilla with chocolate chips and rice krispies can holler at me anytime cuz that flavor, while is a bit too sweet, is FOBulicious! It tastes just like my childhood fave, Horlicks!!! The workers on the other hand, you suck. You better chuck the bad attitude when I come in tomorrow for round 2. **6/3/07 Edit -Malt Vanilla is not a regular flavor! =( -Honey Lavender has an acquired taste. -Creme Fraiche is sour but good. -Butter Pecan is even better. -Salted Caramel--I only got a taste but now that I believe the hype is true, I'm gonna have to go back and get 2 scoops. It tastes like toffee, and toffee is the shit!

I can't go to Dolores park without being tempted by the Bi-Rite Creamery.  Sooooooooo good. You can sample loads of flavours, and I normally do (heh) but I always end up getting the same combination, because it's just sooo damn tasty.   The salted caramel and the ricanelas with bits of snickerdoodle are simply delicious. The creme fraiche is also yummy, and the coffee toffee....and pretty much all of them! Go get an ice cream and sit in the park (and then jog around it 20 times, as that ice cream sure is creamy!) :) But be warned, if you go on a warm day, expect a line that goes right round the block!

Re-discover your love for ice cream here!! I love their original and unique flavors. Every time I come here I alway wish I was more brave, so I can try more wild flavors. I always can't help but go back to my favorites... Roasted Banana, Cookies and Cream, and Brown Butter Pecan. I have sampled there Salted Caramel, Honey Lavender, and Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle. The people who work here are amazing also. They always offer samples of there new flavors and encourage you to step outside of what you always get. If with a line outside they don't just grab your money and rush you out the door. They seem to be always happy (I would be too if I was around ice cream all day ;). The aroma of the place is so creamy and delicious. Even in the winter there is a line out the door and even in the winter it's the perfect time for Bi-Rite. Last time I was in town for a 3 day trip, our friends ended up coming here like 3 times...haha Got to love ice cream!

Bi rite is tasty! The line can get ridiculous for a reason.  The stuff here is quite impressive!  very reminiscent of Molly Moon's or Blue bird here in Seattle.  I got a scoop of something that had cinnamon and snickerdoodle.  Its as pricey as most of these high end gourmand ice cream places tend to be, a scoop clocking in over 3 dollars.  Hey, that lavender can be tough to harvest right!?

I'm a lucky bastard. I live just a few blocks away from Bi-Rite and have the devilishly good advantage of coming here after early Sunday brunches, thereby beating the crowd and completing my Sunday meal. I came for the first time last Sunday--perfect weather to eat a cone in Dolores Park! I tried the Toasted Banana and Lavender Honey... OMG, yum! I haven't had fantastic home-made ice cream since my days in Pittsburgh, and their flavors are rich but not overpowering, and most importantly... simple! They made for the perfect Sunday. At $2.25 for a "single scoop" (two mounds of cream, i.e. two tasty options), it's plenty of high quality ice cream at about the same prices I remember paying for commercial places like Baskin Robbins. With a stamp card and appetite in hand, I am a return customer, guaranteed.

Love this place!  Lots of unique ice cream flavors that make you want to keep coming back for more.  Sam's sundae is amazing!  Chocolate ice cream, bergamot olive oil, maldon sea salt and whipped cream.  Who would've thought to put bergamot olive oil on chocolate ice cream? Brilliant!!  And the  sea salt and fresh whipped cream makes an oh-so-yummy combination.  The salted caramel ice cream is super delish as well, and the their popsicles taste so fresh - almost better than eating a real fruit!   I just wish there was a Bi-Rite closer to my house so I could go more often!  Well, I've got the maldon sea salt at home... now I have to go buy some bergamot olive oil and I'll make my own Sam's Sundae!

I've sworn off sweets except for special occasions, but my defenses totally went down when my 14-year-old niece asked where we could get some ice cream on a warm (by SF standards) night...and she offered to buy (what a little sweetie, eh?). I had not made it here yet, so this was a great opportunity to see if all the hype was true. Yep, the salted caramel is great. In fact, I can't even remember what the others we had were...oh yeah: the Coffee Toffee was good too. I've also had a Sam's Sundae before--at the street food fair--which turned me on to chocolate ice cream with olive oil and sea salt. Yep, long line. Creamy texture. Good stuff. It's all true.

Bi-Rite Creamery gives you a reason to say, "Check please after you meal" so you can shoot over to 18th for dessert!  It's a creative creamery that serves samples with silver spoons!  I sampled about 6 of their flavors, including salted caramel, roasted banana, chocolate chai, coffee toffee, vanilla and butter pecan.  You don't get overpowered by the cream like other spots and you can actually taste the ingredients.  Hefty servings and they accept credit card transactions over $10.  If you are a light eater, share the sundae because you will waste your money by throwing the other half in the garbage.  By the way, it is also a bakery and they have cookies, pies, etc.   You must get the Roasted Banana ice cream with whip cream drizzled with caramel on top.  Now!!!  What are you waiting for?

Who cares that my body physical rebels when I indulge in ice cream? This is worth a night of intestinal punishment! But enough about me, on to the creamery! Service: It was great! Even though there were a few people milling about inside, the staff was very helpful and patient while letting people sample as many flavors as they wanted. Very important for us indecisive people. Flavors: Tried the Salted Caramel and was sold. I tried the Toffee Coffee, but it was a little too strong in the coffee flavor... and I do love my coffee. Space: I only wish there was a little more space inside to hang out. Unfortunately, they only have 3 little stools and not much space to mill about. Be prepared to take your ice cream to go, or sit outside on one of the cute benches built around the trees. Can't wait to go back and try some more goodies!

Best Sundae's I've ever had: BROWNIE SUNDAE 5/5 - Most brownie sundae's focus on the gooeyness of the heavy brownie and the warmth of the fudge. This baby hinges on the creaminess of it's Bi-Rite Vanilla, the sweetness (but not too sweet) of the caramel and fudge, and a crunch coming from the brownie and toasted nuts. The end result is a lighter than normal brownie sundae that doesn't leave you in a coma and makes you wanna slap the chef. SAM's SUNDAE 4.5/5 - Chocolate Ice Cream, OLIVE OIL and SALT?!!  Chocolate ice cream is chocolate ice cream: chocolate, cold, icee, smooth. This sundae brings a salty component and an oily, rich, lukewarm and slightly olivey component that makes this sundae much more than just chocolate ice cream. It's a complex, must try it once in your life or more creation that leaves you gossiping to your friends, "Hey, have you ever tried chocolate ice cream with olive oil and salt? I have." That conveys to them that you're a FOODIE, meaning you've gone far beyond the common Dreyer's Chocolate for your chocolate fix; you go for Sam's Sundae.

As with everyone else in this city, I am flippin' obsessed with Bi-Rite ice-cream.  I dream about it.  I tweet about it (what a dork).  I make salted caramel on top of Kitchenette ginger cookies my new sex therapy.  Or, um, substitute-for-sex therapy.  I lay down wads of cash way in excess of $60 on weekend shopping sprees because everything looked *that* good and the supplies don't last me a week...and the checkout girl had the NERVE to tease me about it...  (Yeah, me, you, and everyone you know.) So, here's a hint, guys.  Buying at the creamery--BAD PLAN.  If you want ice-cream (in massive doses, duh) and you want it fast, don't wait in the line.  Buy it in the Bi-Rite co-op down the street. I'm a total idiot for telling you this, but then, I feel bad for all y'all..patiently waiting in the neverending mess outside the creamery, when you *could* scoop up a quart in less than three minutes flat.   To execute the three minute plan, I recommend: a driver (to circle the block... did you really think there was parking?  in the mission??), $8 of purchasing power, plastic spoons or sporks for scooping, and those creepy clown cones you get out of the box.  SO READY.

Amazing ice cream. I recommend the salted caramel soft serve. It is very inexpensive, considering how good quality it is. They do make-your-own sundae bars for parties, which I think is awesome. I went to a bar mitzvah and made a Bi-Rite sundae -- It was the best sundae I ever had! The only problem with this place is that there can be long lines sometimes.

This place serves up some of the best ice cream I've ever had in my life.  I've tried the honey lavender, salted caramel, almond cherry, and one other flavor.  You've got to try the salted caramel.  Almond cherry also is fantastic (with nice chunks of cherry and tiny bits of almond mixed in).  3.25 gets you a single portion cone with up to 2 flavors.  If you're in the area, then you must stop by. Update: I went last week and got the malted vanilla (w/ peanut brittle and milk chocolate) and the balsamic strawberry.  The strawberry didn't blow me away, but the malted vanilla was fantastic.  Get it!

Hell hath no fury like a foodie scorned.  I've been disappointed more than a few times by the 7x7 top 100 list.   So it was with low expectations, and high hopes that I ventured forth from Ritual to Bi-Rite. Wading my way through the Mission hipsters to the counter, I ordered...wait for it...the salted caramel, and had what is reffered to as an EOR: Ethan Orgasmic Reaction.  Seriously, everyone needs to taste this at least once. Friendly service and sublime flavors.   Bi-Rite is all that, and a bag of your favorite chips, if you ate chips.  Speaking of which....I'm craving a vinegar and sea salt chip right about now.

How many people do you know who don't like ice-cream? Two? Freaks! Well, I am one of those people who'd rather have a meatloaf than ice-cream. Fro-Yo would be the closest I have ever come to ice-cream. No more! This place changed my opinion of ice-cream even Cherry Garcia couldn't. Delicious flavors! I spent close to 10 minutes narrowing down the flavors I wanted to try. Having three flavors in my mind (Honey Lavender, Toasted Coconut, and Crème Fraiche), I spent another 10 minutes deciding which one I really wanted. So after this agonizing struggle, I chose Balsamic Strawberry. I could have never been more right in my life! Ok, maybe only when I decided to move to San Francisco... Balsamic Strawberry is the mix of tangy taste of balsamic vinegar and sweet strawberries stirred into vanilla ice-cream. Divine. You Scream, I Scream!

I love love love Bi-Rite ice cream! I always try to come here whenever I come to the City. Tastiest ice cream ever! My go-to flavors: earl grey and ricanelas (the snickerdoodle one). Roasted banana and the brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl are yummy too. There is almost always a long line but the wait is always worth it.

LONGEST LINE EVER. Okay, I will admit that some of it was my fault--I decided to stumble over to this place on a Sunday around 2-3 pm. Not the best idea. But really? Out the door, down the block and around the corner? I can't imagine how any businesses next to Birite even make business--or actually on second thought this is probably bringing customers in for them. Hm. Either way, line was WAY TOO long for me, so we just went to the soft serve window. Got the twist sundae (with honey roasted peanuts and hot fudge). It was good, for sure, but nothing that special. I've had much better soft serve in my day (you gotta hit up Yogurt Park in berkeley) and would definitely not come back. As the top reviewed place on Yelp, I really do not feel like this place measures up to its reputation :/

Inventive flavors, AMAZING AMAZING macaroon & chocolate ice cream sandwich cookies. I tried 5 flavors (meaning I came home w/ 5 pints of ice cream) and while the flavors were wild I did NOT like the texture.  Every pint was "fuzzy" and not smooth and creamy.  And I've had a lot of ice cream from many places but I seem to be in the minority here w/ just 3 stars.  Maybe an off batch?     Flavors are hard to talk about I think, b/c it is so subjective but here are my 2cents: - salted caramel: best of the bunch & crowd favorite - lavender honey: WAY too much lavender. I like lavender in food but this was like eating soap - balsamic strawberry: delicious - coffee toffee: very chunky w/ lots of toffee - chai milk chocolate: VERY strong chai

I am not a patient woman and try to avoid lines and other inefficient uses of my time at all costs.  But with rave reviews from the "high nosed Peruvian", I decided to stick it out in the long line, in heat and with the aroma of sewage seeping thru the vents for a taste of this mana from heaven.   It was worth the 25 minute wait ... the balsamic strawberry, honey lavender and salted caramel ice creams that I tasted were like bursts of angelic laughter on a hot summers day.  Seriously, it was some tasty shit.  Too bad I was out for the rest of the day or I would have stocked up on a pint of each flavor!

Our dear friend managed to lower our expectation by shrugging his shoulders and nonchalantly described Bi-Rite as "alright" when we made a proposal to stop by for some ice cream after Cha-Ya super healthy dinner.   "Oh."  We were disappointed and confused because there are always a gazillion people outside whenever we drive by. And then our friend proceeds to find parking right in front of the front door around 10pm on a Friday evening.  So we had to go in and give it a try.  My fiance got Orange Cardamon and some sort of vanilla.  I wasn't paying much attention to what they got because I was busy charmed by the cute shop.  People continuously flooded into this small place you coulda swore it's 80 degrees out.  Unfortunately it's more like 50 and thus the cute benches around the trees outside were totally wasted.   Our friend got salted caramel.  And yes, he claims Bi-Rite is only "alright."  But yes, he inhaled that whole thing in 2 minutes and talked about how good it is.   Oh well, aren't we all a little contradictory in life at times? I tasted the orange cardamon and that some-sort-of-vanilla ice cream.  It's good.  And interesting.  And made us discuss what cardamon really is for a while.  So in case you are wondering too, here is what they say in Wikipedia: [Cardamons] are used as flavorings in both food and drink...(boring Wiki details)...Cardamom has a strong, unique taste, with an intensely aromatic fragrance.  Black cardamom has a distinctly more astringent aroma, though not bitter, with a coolness similar to mint, though with a different aroma...(more boring Wiki details)...It is one of the most expensive spices by weight, and little is needed to impart the flavor....(Ooh, here is an interesting fact): It is broadly used to treat infections in teeth and gums, to prevent and treat throat troubles, congestion of the lungs and pulmonary tuberculosis, inflammation of eyelids and also digestive disorders. Well, I thought it tasted like lemon.

"Tootally rad dude" - Kathy S. , Yelper Thank you random person sitting next to me @ Isobune Sushi today for suggesting this place. No regrets here! I swear the rumor is 30 minute wait but it really felt more like only 20 minutes and either way I'd wait up to 45 minutes for this delicacy! I first tasted the lavender (they let you taste) and it was too much for my palate so I ordered the double half cinnamon, half salted caramel. It was so fresh and flavorful each bite brought me closer to the meaning of life. I saw little elves marching around with balloons after the first bite, then confetti floating around me after the second bite. I swear I saw a Unicorn walk right by me by the 3rd bite and then I was somewhere in heaven by the 4th... Just got better and better.. it had a consistency somewhere between hard and soft ice cream and was somewhat like cookie dough.. It was an experience that I savored whilst seated on one of their benches outside. PS- Across the street is a grocery also named Bi-Rite and they sell the ice cream there all the way at the back in the freezer section. There is a lot of hype there too as people are grabbing their favorite flavors and paring them with crackers and whatnot.. but I didn't really see a line.

Came here again last night and there was no line albeit it was freezing outside. My best friend brought her friend here since he's never tried their ice cream before. Wasn't planning on getting anything and was waiting for my loverman to arrive first in case he wanted something so we could just share. He didn't want anything but he got me the Earl Grey Tea ice cream. Mmmmm. It was amazing! I am a huge fan of tea and this had a really strong tea flavor. It was nice to have something other than green tea. He said the orange cardamon flavor looked good and I told him it sounded disgusting to me. He ended up narrowing down the flavors to his top three to sample. Haha. He said he tried the orange cardamon flavor first and it was so bad it ruined the other flavors he sampled. He ended up getting the salted caramel. I tried his and we both wished it was saltier. Best friend bought a pack of their toffee cookies there. They were pretty bad. I can bake better cookies myself. We also just bought a dozen cookies from Anthony's on Valencia right before coming here so that might be another reason why they tasted like shit.

Whoa whoa stop the presses.  SALTED CARAMEL ICE CREAM?? YES PLEASE THANKS! The frozen yogurt train hit Los Angeles HARD and I was a victim of the aftermath - so many trips to Menchies, and YogurtLand, and YogurtZone, and Yogurberry, and so on and so forth and I thought I had sworn off ice cream FOREVER... until!!! The Creamery.  The subtitle to this place should be called "the dreamery" Salted caramel sundae, with house made graham crackers AND house made sauces equals a very pleased me.  This ice cream was the perfect blend of salty, sweet, bitter, and savory.  Taste bud satisfaction levels 100% Keep in mind - they don't take American Express (like so many other places in SF, wtf?) but they do take MC and Visa.  One woman ahead of me in line had two little girls and she didn't realize this but the counter girl was so nice and let her come back with the cash.  Great customer service! She didn't want to disappoint the two little girls. Only crazy people eat ice cream in freezing windy rain, right?

Sam's sundae, two scoops of chocolate ice cream drizzled with Bergamot olive oil sprinkled with Maldon sea salt, sounds interesting? Well sure it does sound odd but then again it makes sense. you have rich ice cream and to compliment it with a fruity citrus olive oil. then the sprinkles of Maldon sea salt to give it a contrast in flavor that just jumps out at you. So all of this should have given it a 5 stars right? blame it on the great food i had right before i came here or the ice cream parlor across the bay. More so i rather blame that the olive oil was lost as the salt overwhelmed my taste buds in this sundae. What ultimately got it only 4 stars is that i can take the sea salt and do it myself at home and get very similar results.

I can simply sum up this review into two words: SALTED CARAMEL. It's a very creamy, caramel ice cream with just the right hint of saltiness, unlike the Vinegar Caramel at Humphry Slocombe which tastes way too salty after a few bites. The texture of this BiRite staple seems to be much creamier than any of their other flavors, and is actually close to gelato. I've also had the balsamic strawberry, and the roasted banana. Both were good, but nothing beats that salted caramel!

Pick your poison: Cream or Butter? The ice cream, smooth like buttah, made from cream. The cupcakes, frosting so creamy, most certainly butter. Like a sugar-laced, supple, buttery bosom you want to bury your face in. Yes, just like that. You wait in line for ice cream and you probably never even considered getting anything but the cold stuff. But wait, there's more. When it's not blistering hot out, get your cake and eat it too. Warm spice: think pumpkin pie transformed into a delicate crumb. Salted Caramel: and you thought the ice cream was good, OMG! This takes the cake. It's both frosted and filled with sweet-salty-buttery love. Your arteries may hate you but your sensory organs will love you forever.

With over 2600 reviews, I still feel obligated to write a review on Bi-Rite Creamery to spread the word of deliciousness. Their ice cream is so creamy and dense, the unique flavors that they offer add to the amazing-ness of this establishment. The guy working was nice enough to let us sample almost every single flavor they had. He's so friendly, I think my boyfriend fell in love with him. We had the malted vanilla, salted caramel, honey lavender, and the cherry one. Even though it was slightly chilly outside, we gobbled it up as if we were burning in summer heat. The malted vanilla was so good that we went back to order another scoop. On our way driving back to San Diego, James and I were reminiscing about how good Bi-Rite's ice cream is. When I visit San Francisco again, know that I am merely going there for Bi-Rite creamery.

Small world.  Its interesting writing reviews about places in other cities, and then seeing how many of your local friends have written about those places themselves; it really is a small world.  Also, writing some of these SF reviews, I'm blown away by the reviewing capacity of the SF crowd, but SF is the home of yelp, so I guess its not a surpise.  Still it must be pretty hard to get a "first to review" here in this city I think. Anyhow, got Sam Sundae's, was alright.  Chocolate, whipped cream, olive oil, maldron sea salt, when you mash and mix them all together, the sundae definitely gets better, and while I liked it, I don't see what makes it a "best things I ever ate".  Sampled some of the other flavors, but nothing hammered me in the face.  Still good, but not after the hype I had heard, and also considering the other places I tried that weekend.  But Bi-rite's in a neighborhood with other good restaurants, and stands as a nice place to get that late night sweet snack...

Sorry Polly Ann's, Humphry Slocome, Mitchell's and Fenton's; this is still my favorite ice-cream parlor ;) -The Salted Caramel is off the charts good!  The pairing of the salted caramel with the sweet sweet counterpart.  There's a reason why we have Bi-Rite even in the winter lol.  Not trying this flavor at least once is foodie-treason! -I also like the Balsamic Strawberry.  Again, the pairing of the Vinegars tartness, the strawberry's natural tartness yet balanced out by the sweetness of the ice-cream is unbelievable. -The Honey Lavender is pretty good, I only eat this in the summer time for some reason. Now they have an extra window next door for me to order Hot-Chocolate after eating the super cold ice-cream?  Nice! It's 59 degrees outside, time to go get Bi-Rite ;D

Parking was annoying. As I was circling around looking for a space, I noticed a really long line twisting almost around the corner. I thought it was a line to a club or something but when I finally found a spot, I headed closer and realized it was a line just for a darn scoop of ice cream! I was sampling at least 4 flavors and really couldn't decide. I finally  7x7 recommended flavor: the famous Salted Caramel and cherished every bite. There was so much bursts of caramel flavor and with the hint of salt, perfectly balanced out the sweetness of the caramel. I definitely want to give the coffee toffee a shot next time and maybe a scoop of cookies and cream. The line seemed a bit long, but it moved fast. So don't turn back! If you know what you want, you can head straight to the cash register and order a prepackaged pint (i might do that next time!).

Absolutely delicious ice cream!  We got lucky and only had to wait 10 minutes on a beautiful Sunday afternoon.  I had the salted caramel with coffee toffee.  Wowza!  The salted caramel is a delicious burnt sugar treat with just a hit of salt to scintillate your taste buds.  The coffee toffee has a great, strong coffee flavor with actual granules of coffee and perfectly sized toffee chunks.  My companion had the Brown Sugar with a Ginger Swirl and Balsamic Strawberry.  The strawberry was okay - good flavor, but I would have liked chunks of berries, which I did not see.  The brown sugar with ginger swirl was the second best ice cream that I have every had - a great lighltly molasses flavored ice cream with a spicy-sweet ginger swirl.  Loved it!

Sorry, Yelp, you've let me down.  Yelp, I take your ratings pretty seriously, and this time you were just plain wrong.  THIS is your idea of a 5-star ice cream place??? I couldn't wait to try Bi-Rite after hearing that it may just be the best ice cream place in California.  Having high expectations often sets one up for disappointment.  Perhaps, that's the lesson here, kids. My friend and stopped by Bi-Rite last night.  Dolores Park was jumpin', and 4 cop cars were driving around in circles, so . . . no funny stuff.  We found an awesome parking spot right on the corner of 18th and Dolores and crossed the street. It was a hot day in the City, and yet there were only 4 people in line at Bi-Rite.  "That's strange," I thought, remembering my last visit to Mitchell's, highlighted by a 32-minute wait. I ordered two scoops in a compostable, biodegradable cup.  Frankly, I would have preferred a waffle cup/bowl which would have been even more biodegradable in my tummy.  I opted for a scoop of roasted banana and a scoop of cookies 'n' cream for $4.75, topped with chocolate shortcake for an additional 75 cents.   The topping was good, and there was a lot of it; so much that they couldn't fit it all in.  They even gave me a tiny cup with a few more pieces of the chocolate shortcake which tasted like a truffle brownie.  Mmmm, truffle brownie.  The ice cream itself, however, was not very good.  Mealy and watery, it was kind of disappointing.  Cookies 'n' cream flavor was very pedestrian, and the roasted banana lacked banana flavor, believe it or not. One word about the Bi-Rite employees: there's something weird about them.  They seem genuinely happy.  I mean, really, reeeeeally happy.  I am talking HAPPY.  Happy like a 16-year-old boy on Prozac who just scored a touchdown to win State, found $100 on the street, received a Playstation 3 as a gift from his parents, and finally got to second with his girlfriend.   In my humble opinion, Mitchell's is still the best ice cream in San Francisco.  They have long lines, no benches outside and no compostable anything.  All they have is tasty ice cream, which isn't so bad in my book.

I love creative ice cream flavors, especially when they taste not only intriguing but divinely good.  Across from one of my favorite restaurants in the city, Delfina, and an organic goods shop with the same namesake, Bi-Rite attracts patrons like bees to honey.  My favorite is a tie between honey lavender and salted caramel.  For honey lavender, just imagine that teasing scent of pure lavender, emitting a complex range of delicately clean, floral, herbal, and finishing with a honeyed sweetness.  Salted caramel is perfectly named, for it captures how mouth-puckeringly salty when juxtaposed to addictively sweet can create a mouthwatering harmony of opposites. My other favorites are flavors I have, for the most part, had at other high quality ice cream parlors:  balsamic strawberry (so refreshing and fresh-tasting, a seasonal item so live it up), roasted banana (like slightly nutty, toasted banana), coffee toffee (relatively unexciting, but the coffee is from Ritual and it really tastes like good coffee), chocolate soy (rich and creamy), lemon (lightly tangy), and chai spiced milk chocolate (like a great cup of chai). Service is fun and really friendly.  You can tell they love working there.  They are really cool about letting you sample.  I shamelessly ask and ask, and as they hand me the mini spoons, they just look at me with an ear-to-ear smile like they completely understand.  "We know, we know," they telepathically convey, "How can I not want to at least try orange cardamom, creme fraiche, and pluot sorbet?"  Thank you for your patience and empathy, lucky staff (imagine the freebies) of one of the best ice cream shops in San Francisco, and with Delfina, Tartine, and Dolores Park within walking distance, definitely the best location.

I've been sitting on this review for three weeks. Just like something that's perfect, it's a daunting task to try and explain my love for Bi-Rite. But after not eating it for over a week (the longest I've strayed away this entire summer), I feel enough distance to look at this place objectively, with reason, and with a hindsight. Kind of like a break up allows you to see things you didn't see before, but Bi-Rite is a place I will keep coming back to...probably in the next few days. My relationship with Bi-Rite Creamery: We met one faithful day, when I decided to check out the hype. Went for the riconelas, was mildly impressed. Real nice cinnamon tastes with bits of snickerdoodle, one my favorite kind of cookies. Over the next several visits, I started to acquaint myself with the different flavors through tasting with their silverware spoons. For awhile, I ordered a single balsamic strawberry as a safe bet, before I decided to jump into more adventurous tastes. My breakthrough moment was the honey lavender. Light, refreshing, and definitely unique. The cool taste of lavender lingered in my mouth moments after I scarfed it down. I became a huge fan of their strawberry-cherry sorbet, still unmatched by their other variations (such as peach-ginger, peach-cantalope etc). Coffee toffee was another favorite, with specks of Ritual coffee and oh-so-satisfying toffee bits. I've made it a point to share this spot with all my loved ones, whether it's my parents who are visiting from out-of-town or with my friends after dinner. Strangers too: I picked up a French tourist and gave him a tour of the Mission, which ended with us sitting at Dolores Park with our single cups of Bi-Rite. This little ice cream shop holds a sweet spot in my heart--there's nothing more satisfying than grabbing dessert and sitting down on those wooden benches with my favorite people.

AME-MAZING!! Not one other person in the shop on a sunny Sunday. Cute interior with thoughtful touches of decor. Asked lots of questions and got the insider scoop. Tasted Pumpkin (OK- good flavor), Salted Caramel, and Honey Lavender. Choose to buy a half and half scoop of Salted Caramel and Honey Lavender... best versions of those two flavors I have had! A half scoop seemed small, but the deep flavor of the ice cream made it filling. FYI's * Someone in Seattle opened almost the exact same shop as Bi Rite- with the same flavors... BUT her ice creams taste does not compare to Bi Rite- the Seattle copycat can't get the flavors from being too strong or too lackluster in the unique combinations * Biodegradable cups with small wooden stick/spoons * Moderate prices that match the quality

Yes, finally I got to Bi-Rite Creamery!  And it was good, as expected! When I got into the store, I saw that the price of a single scoop was $3.  My jaw just about dropped, but I went ahead anyway and got a cup of the honey lavender. It was one of the best and most enjoyable cups of ice cream I've ever had.  The honey flavor was very noticeable, with an ever so slight aftertaste of lavender.  The flavors complemented each other quite well. All the other flavors looked delicious too, especially the roasted banana!

Gah...

Topped off with a sprinkling of great service from the awesome Bi-Rite staff. -7 bucks from my bank account. Yes! I kind of went overboard. Yes! it was freezing that day! Did that keep me from finishing my sundae? Hell nahhhh! I ate it all with the awesome compostable spoon. Need to come back for Sam's sundae..the thought of chocolate ice cream and olive oil makes me drool like crazy. (I realized halfway through my sundae that it was the sundae that was featured on food network a while ago..*chortle*) Regardless..I've experienced that chocolate plus olive oil equals heaven in your mouth so no doubt I'm coming back for you, Sam (;

Umm... how can you not like Bi-Rite Creamery? Or ice cream in general?! they're seriously scoops of heaven. May I suggest the banana roast flavor? Or the honey lavender?? You would expect the honey lavender to be very subtle and sweet tasting, but it really gives an herbal-spicy kick after a bite!I gotta try the Earl Gray flavor next time!

I'm not big on sweets, but when there's so much rave about anywhere or anything, I have to hop on the bandwagon and try. Finally tried Bi-Rite a few days ago while making a trip to Dolores Park on this year's official start of warm weather season (or so it feels like). The ice cream is just as good as the reviews reflect. I tried the Honey Lavender since there seemed to be so many good reviews about it, and also the Almond Fudge Swirl, since I love anything Almond flavored. The Honey Lavender was really good, but I think I rather be smelling that flavor than tasting it. The Almond Fudge Swirl was absolutely delicious - loved the Almond flavor and the Fudge swirled in was a great compliment and sidekick to it. Yes, the flavors are wonderful, but what makes the ice cream here go above and beyond others is the texture and flavor of the ice cream itself - full flavored, creamy, delicious. I am definitely coming back - gotta take friends here, and it's a great spot to stop by, grab ice cream and go hang out at the park.

After reading numerous review... I've wanted to come here for so long, but has never been able to make it. It just so happen we were at Pizzeria Delfina and decided since we were so close we will eat ice cream here. I ordered the salted caramel and chocolate.  the chocolate is a very deep dark chocolate, to the point where its more chocolate than sweet.  I like.  very very rich chocolate.  the salted caramel... was goooodddd... I will definitely get that again.  As my friend Monica described it, it tasted like the toasted outside of a marshmallow, but cold... no burning of the tongue here.  the ice cream texture itself was smooth.  its very dense and rich.  I scrapped that cup to the last lick.  ITs true... its definitely good to the last lick. My friend got toasted coconut and she was quite surprised that it was actually toasted coconut.  My other friend got the lemon pistachio and snickerdoodle, which both i also liked.   I guess i liked everything I tried there.

Came here after finding out Humphrey Slocombe ran out of most of thier flavors! Since we had kids in our group, I'm glad we ended up here because Bi-Rite is definately more flavor friendly to kids than Humphrey Slocombe is.   When we arrived, the line was long but it moved pretty smoothly.  I don't remember it being this crowded when I first came here a couple of years ago. They also have a seating area inside, which all ten of us were lucky to take over!   My flavor choices were Salted Caramel and Roasted Banana - Oooh my, they were BOTH sooo good. Not only are they individually good...they're even better together!  The kids were a big fan of the cookies & cream flavor. I gotta try that (and more) next time around! PS. Be sure to get a frequent flyer card! FYI: Parking can be very challenging in the Mission district due to Dolores park and many other good eats around the area.  Don't worry...the ice cream is worth the wait!

Hard to add to the reviews, but if you're reading this just know that I felt compelled to add another 5-star review as review number 3921. Come and get the salted caramel, then hit Mission Dolores park and eat your ice cream.

Salted caramel for the win!!! No go on the balsamic strawberry :/ My friend got that and we werent very satisfied with it. The line was LONG! But it was worth it to try the unique flavors of Bi-Rite's ice cream. The salted caramel pretty much tasted like burnt caramel but I still liked it. :)

Seventh heaven for ice cream afficianados.  Where else can you go in the world and get homemade salt caramel ice cream, toffee chunks, and caramel, sustainably and lovingly prepared by brilliant geniuses?  Have you ever bought salt caramels at the Ferry Plaza building, you know, the artisan ones that are like $20 for a little box, and they leave your mouth watering for days?  Well, that's how good this ice cream is. Check this out -- they even have Ritual Coffee Roasters ice cream!  Talk about creating community through flavors! Bi-Rite is the seed child of someone inspiring who created the best little grocery store on the West Coast, with the best customer service. And now they're bringing us all ice cream. THANKYOU!!!  I LOVE YOU!!! Seriously, let's be friends.  Thanks for giving us such a gift!

I expect God to serve me the salted caramel and honey lavender ice cream in heaven. Actually, I expect to be licking these flavors off of Matthew McConaughey's naked body in heaven. God, can you arrange that for me please? I promise to be good...

Awesome possum.  I hear these guys use Strauss creamery milk (which is organic, local, and delicious) for their creative and well-balanced ice creams.  The creme fraiche flavor is tart but still sweet, and perfect with the spiced pecan topping! Bonus: They use real spoons for tastes to save on plastics, and their containers/flatware are compostable.  Gotta love 'em.

Bi Rite Creamery takes ice cream to a new level.  If you even remotely kinda sorta like ice cream ... you need to come here.  In fact, stop what you are doing, turn off your computer, get in your car / bike / moped / roller blades / magic carpet / time machine, and get here now.   I took my mom here during a "girls weekend" in the city and she fell in love with the salted carmel.  In fact, she would talk about it on a daily basis.   So now, whenever I go home for special celebrations, I bring a pint as a gift.   How good is it?   - It is that good that  I am importing ice cream to Belmont on a regular basis.   - It is that good that I pack a cooler so not a single drop melts.   - It is that good that my parents actually got into a fight when my dad got up in the middle of the night and ate the last spoonful my mom was saving. It is so good, that you need to try it yourself because this post does not do it justice.

I should work for Bi-Rite Creamery's PR department, because I pretty much sell this place to everyone I talk to. I have introduced many loyal fans, and still go back every chance I get... I might be addicted to their Salted Caramel. Seriously, I'm dreaming about it right now. Mmmm Every flavor is orgasmically good - and I'm not exaggerating here. I have tried just about every flavor they offer, and not a single one has disappointed me yet. Some of my favorites aside from the front-runner mentioned above include the Ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles), the Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate, the Balsamic Strawberry, the Toasted Coconut, the Honey Lavender, the Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel... just writing this list is like porn for my taste buds. The line is long, but just think of it as foreplay... the wait is definitely worth the end result.
