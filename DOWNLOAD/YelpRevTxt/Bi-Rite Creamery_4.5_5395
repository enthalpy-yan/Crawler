I should work for Bi-Rite Creamery's PR department, because I pretty much sell this place to everyone I talk to. I have introduced many loyal fans, and still go back every chance I get... I might be addicted to their Salted Caramel. Seriously, I'm dreaming about it right now. Mmmm Every flavor is orgasmically good - and I'm not exaggerating here. I have tried just about every flavor they offer, and not a single one has disappointed me yet. Some of my favorites aside from the front-runner mentioned above include the Ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles), the Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate, the Balsamic Strawberry, the Toasted Coconut, the Honey Lavender, the Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel... just writing this list is like porn for my taste buds. The line is long, but just think of it as foreplay... the wait is definitely worth the end result.

I was warned that the ice cream was really rich because I'm lactose intolerant. But I am lactose intolerant with an affinity for ice cream. =) I had the salted caramel and it was a bit too buttery for my taste. I also had a scoop of the toasted coconut. Now that was YUMMY! I had a taste of my friend's apple pie ice cream and it was like an apple pie a la mode. I should have ordered that one! I didn't like the lavender flavor and the ginger flavor was overpowering. Even though the ice cream was a little too rich for me that I ended up feeling sick, it was worth the pain in the end. Their ice cream is organic and the cones are organic too. WOW! Overall, it was cool but my heart still belongs to Thrifty/Rite Aid ice cream. Coconut pineapple and chocolate malted crunch will always top my list.

Sam's Sundae= A++ :) Salted Caramel= B+ Ricanelas= A+ (the pieces of snickledoodle make me go to a happy place. lol.) _______________ My friend and I went to Bi-Rite on a Friday and it was an absolute gorgeous sunny day in SF! Which only means one thing... everyone in line for some delicious Bi-Rite Ice Cream. The line was just about to turn the corner when we arrived.  There were about 10-15 people ahead of us. I timed it, (so I can report back to my fellow yelpers) and it took about 25 mins for us to order. The time goes by quickly. HINT: 'People watching' is always entertaining in SF. It's also fun to watch people's parallel parking skills (or lack thereof.) My friend and I saw this one car almost knock over the Bi-Rite menu outside. Oh boy! And now on to the the ice cream... Mmm... Sam's Sundae lives up to "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" Food Network Hype! For the adventurous eaters out there... You gotta try it!  It's two scoops of Chocolate ice cream topped with organic bergamot olive oil and maldon sea salt, with hand-whipped whipped cream on the side. Serious yumness. Oh and let me tell you, the customer service here gets an A+.  The girl that was helping me was super nice.  She got a little excited when I asked to sample Salted Caramel. And even more excited when I asked to sample the Ricanelas. She said, "Good choice, It's the staff favorite."   P.S. The Snickerdoodle Ice Cream a.k.a. Ricanelas is SO delicious. If you are a fan of the snickerdoodle cookie, you HAVE to try it.

Words do not describe how much I love bi-rite ice cream!!!!1111 I love all of the creative flavors and the fact that they aren't TOO crazy and actually still taste good. My favorites (flavors do come and go though) - Salted Caramel - omg - if you love caramel... love love love. my personal favorite. - Earl Grey - i have an obsession with earl grey that started circa me living in london for 6 months. but regardless, it has a nice tea flavor that is light and refreshing - malted vanilla - creme fraiche   - Ricanellas - I'm not 100% sure whats in it. but i know it has like cinnamon in it somewhere... - Honey Lavender (i think...) - not my fave bec it kinda tastes like soap. Anyways, the texture is thick and creamy - YUM. I always get a single cup with 2 flavors (1 scoop each) ! ! ! I've compared this place to that place in berkeley icee - I think bi-rite is better =p

Bi Rite has a deal with the devil. That's got to be the reason. There is no way on earth that you can make ice cream so creamy, so smooth, so silky, so much better than everyone else. People will say its the milk, but I mean come on! Do they have some secret cows that lactate better milk? What the heck? Bi Rite has a deal with the devil. That's got to be the reason. How else do you make ice cream that gets softer, not harder in the freezer?? What mad alchemy is this? Adding more sugar? Been there, done that. There's no way this makes things softer in the freezer, no frickin' way. The first time you try Bi Rite, your mouth is wondering what the heck you just ate. I mean no way on earth is this ice cream. It is like nothing you've had before. With each succeeding mouthful you begin to realize that, hey, this is ice cream, this is what real ice cream taste like. At last. Then you realize you've finished the whole pint. Salted Caramel. If you have tried it, no words are necessary. If you haven't tried it, you are a dunce.

Super yummy and creamy ice cream! I've only been here once and I tried the balsamic strawberry, because I thought it sounded totally unique and cool. It was SO DELICIOUS! I would definitely get it again and recommend it to a friend. Disclaimer: Watch out for lines, but not to worry, they move pretty quick! Side note: There's another line on the other side for soft serve. I thought it was kind of odd to separate them because what if you're with friends and one person wants ice cream and the other soft serve? However on the upside, if you just want soft serve, the line was much shorter and faster. Can't wait to go back!

After a night at Off The Grid we headed to Bi-Rite for dessert! I had a slight tummy ache after consuming all the food at OTG so I opted for the orange sorbet. It tasted like frozen orange juice haha. It was still good, though. I normally don't like earl grey tea but I tried a spoonful of my friend's earl grey ice cream and I was shocked that I reeeaaallly liked it! I also tried the honey lavender and was not as delighted. Yes, the line is long but it moves quickly. Don't worry about not knowing the flavors of the day. They post it in several places so you have plenty of time to make a decision. I am excited to come back :)

Thank God I do not live close by to this place.. I'd end up being one tub of lard. The best of the best ice cream.  I've never had anything better than Bi-Rite Creamery.  I've told all my friends that this is a must, and it never disappoints. Some of the flavors are a bit foreign, Honey Lavender, Soy Chocolate, Roasted Banana, Salted Caramel, and etc.. but they never fail.  EVERYTHING is good.  I love how they don't mind you to test out flavors.  They actually give a good sample size and encourage you to try more.. one of everything please.

I've lived in the city for almost 2 years now, and have never tried this delicious heaven of a place. All I really NEED to say is, "SALTED CARAMEL ICE CREAM." I just am in love with it. (my mouth is watering now just thinking about it.) It was a chilly evening but I was in an ice cream kind of mood. The line wasn't too long, but I have heard that it can be out the door and up the block. All the flavors seemed pretty interesting like "Blood Orange" and another one with Lavender in it. I went straight for the salted caramel and enjoyed EVERY last bite. This is a must if you are an ice cream lover. So salty, so sweet, so caramel-y. =) The prices were good too for the amount you get. They really pack your cup. Next time I'm going to try two flavors, but one was enough for my first time.

In an effort to avoid the lamentably long line of sugar deprived Mission hipsters in this unbearable Indian summer heat, my bf and I opted for the shorter [practically nonexistent in comparison] Bi-Rite soft serve line over the usual assortment of magically titillating ice cream flavors. Due to our unwillingness to wait, we made the most disenchanting snafu that has managed to thwart my unvarying passion for Bi-Rite. Yes, the impossible has finally happened. We ordered their special concoction, listed as a "must try" on their handwritten daily board: Vanilla soft serve with blood orange olive oil and a dash of sea salt. The result was a bland and overly sweetened Vanilla soft serve, reminiscent of McDonald's $1 version yet far more pricier in comparison, drizzled far too heavily with blood orange infused olive oil [pretentious much?] with a colossal amount of sea salt sprinkled on top. Bi-Rite, you've pulled a Humphrey Slocombe. Shame on you.

Bi-Rite Creamery is legit! Normally, I prefer frozen yogurt over ice cream, but I had to give Bi-Rite a try after hearing all the buzz. Ordered the Coffee Toffee and Cookies N Cream and jizzed in my pants. Also tried my friend's sundae (forgot the name of it but it had whipped cream, lemon ice cream, and snickerdoodles) and was also pleasantly surprised. Gotta say though, I tried the famous salted caramel and almost yakked out of disgust... (and at this point, I'm fully aware I'll probably lose a lot of credibility with the rest of my reviews) but hey, I have a very refined palate, what can I say...

Normally id knock a star off a place because the portion was small.  i am a beast, and this is no secret...but this place was awesome.   SALTED CARAMEL FTW! I mean, is there really anything else to say?  The wait?

My favorite ice cream shop! Salted Caramel and Ricanellas all day every day! Ricanellas is a Cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodle cookie pieces within. The ice cream does melt quickly so do eat it fast, but you would anyway since the flavors are different from your ordinary coffee shop. I didn't like the Coffee Toffee since it had a denser coffee taste; I anticipated a Haagen Daz Coffee taste. The prices are decent for the what you receive and I assure you that you will be coming back for more. This is a must go-to place anytime you visit San Francisco! Stop reading about it and go try it! P.S. They also have cool spoons.

Simply the best ice cream I've ever had, period.  You can't over-hype. Over-hyping this place would be like over-hyping the experience of your wedding day or having your first child. I got the snickerdoodle and salted caramel...AMAZING.  Not too rich, not too sweet, perfect creaminess, and perfect flavor. This place beats ICI in Berkeley by a mile, plus service is 100% better, as they patiently let you try numerous flavors. I would give it 6 stars if I could, and I don't even like sweets that much.

Two words: salted caramel. I had one taste of their salted caramel ice cream, and I was sold. The balsamic strawberry is delicious, but nothing compares to the salted caramel. Their ice cream cakes are also delicious. Try balsamic strawberry with chocolate cake! Got to admit, their soft serve just doesn't compare to the ice cream. It doesn't matter if it's foggy or rainy, the line can be long. Tip: buy pints of the ice cream in the soft serve line to avoid the wait. The ginger ice cream tastes like ACTUAL ginger (hint: pass!)

Put me in the ranks of Bi-Rite crazy San Franciscans. Sure Mitchell's has more variety, sure you have to wait less at Maggie Mudd, sure Bombay Creamery has all those great Indian flavors, but Bi-Rite Creamery occupies a special place in my heart. It's the combination of excellent ice-cream, perfect location (take your frozen heaven and enjoy it while lying on the grass in Dolores Park) and environmental consciousness (compostable cups, spoons and cartons and an effort to use local and organic ingredients). The staff are super-nice as well. I remember rushing to Bi-Rite after dinner with a big and slightly loony group of friends, only to find the creamery closed and the staff cleaning up. Deprived of our dessert fix, we stood outside the glass door making sad faces at the staff. They good-naturedly let us in to pick up a couple of pints. Salted Caramel and Honey Lavender ice-creams were the perfect ending to the evening.

Ok, it's no Mitchell's, but it'll do. A shop that made me stray from normal order of mint chocolate chip. Something just said to me, "try the chai milk chocolate". "And the cookies and cream..." Although the roasted banana was making me salivate as well, I regretfully declined its siren song. As my friend and I perused the list of flavors that day, honey lavender was tempting, but something so exotic, perfumed and yet dairy-filled could go horribly awry. I decided to step away. I got my single scoop to go and sat out in the sun. After an afternoon field gazing in Dolores Park, it was the perfectly timed next step. Sure there's a wait, but all good things come...blah blah blah.

After stuffing ourselves with the starchy delights  at Charanga ranging from the common potato gratin to the fried Yucca pieces accompanied with their wonderful aioli, topped off with a cup of their sweet strong sangria, we decided to take a short jaunt to Bi-Rite for a smooth finish to our rainy yet  fun social gathering. Located on a pretty quiet street up from Delfina, the line was out the door.  But this was not a line of tourists, but rather locals from the Dolores area.   Different concoctions of ice cream reign supreme here, with true flavors of peanut butter, lavender honey infused secrets, and rocky road chock full of almonds and marshmallows....this is the real deal.  I opted for the old stand-by white chocolate raspberry and a scoop of the lavender honey.  The white chocolate raspberry was exactly as it sounds: creamy, with the right amount of raspberry ribbons to deliver the fruity punch within a vanilla smorgasbord.  The lavender honey treat was light with the floral notes, and toned down with the sweet tendering of pure honey.  I was in heaven. Around $4 for two scoops and I finished every single wooden spoonful while standing there in the store sharing in funny conversations with my dear friends. Try their other flavors as well: burnt caramel, olive oil, and the granitas.

GREAT ICE CREAM! There was a huge line on a Tuesday  night, but had really good toasted coconut ice cream.  The coffee toffee, was a little too toffee for me. But the real reason I had to write about my experience was that the guy behind the counter was a little, well, "unhappy" and he was barking at the customers: "No more samples after you - this is all the ice cream I have and a thousand people behind you." and the line of the night, after all the barking: "I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU WRITE ON YELP, WE'LL STILL BE HERE IN 30 YEARS" Well, at least he's acknowledging the power of yelp!

Soooo yummy! The first time I went a little past 9pm on a weeknight and there were about 10 people out the door. (20 people total in line). I heard someone say this was a very short line, and I believe them. The ice cream here is so good, how could there not be a long line? Since that first time, I've been multiple times, taking a new friend whenever possible. The servers are very friendly, and you feel welcomed to try 2+ flavors without feeling rushed or bothersome. All of their flavors are so delicious: salted caramel, toasted banana, honey lavender, balsamic strawberry, white chocolate with raspberry swirls, etc!  I really liked that the flavors and menus were handwritten-- It all really goes well with the homemade ice cream/local ingredients they use. I absolutely loved their creme fraiche flavor, which I very rarely see as a flavor. How amaaazing it was! It had the perfect creme fraiche flavor without the sourness of real creme fraiche. Their meyer lemon is truly good enough to write home about. It tastes like a lemon cake. It's a must-try in my mind. I always have the kids size, which was $2.25. The perfect size when you just want the same size scoop as you would serve yourself at home. The small, at $3.25, allows you to choose 2 flavors. Their ice cream cakes are truly divine as well (~$30). I had never had "gourmet" ice cream cake, but I don't think I'll ever go back to the regular stuff.

4 stars for the creative flavor ice cream that actually taste good! The only thing I dislike is how sweet it is... It is definitely a lot sweeter than a normal dryers ice cream. Salted caramel - this one surprised me. The flavor was quite good! Who would have thought salt and caramel. It would be perfect but it's just too sweet for my taste. Great to try. Malted vanilla with peanut brittle - this one is my favorite here so far. It isn't as sweet as the salted caramel, but still a tad too sweet. I love the malty flavor and the crunch from the peanut brittle. Honey lavender - this one just isn't my cup of tea. I hated the lavender taste. It tasted like I was eating perfume flavored ice cream. Portions are ok. The junior size is good enough for me. Price is pricier than any other regular ice cream place, but then again this place don't serve regular ice cream.

I've pretty much tried all the flavors here as they are pretty generous with the samples.. My two favorites were the Salted Caramel and the Roasted Banana. Salted Caramels in real life are generally fuckin amazing and to have it in ice cream form pretty much answers all my prayers and hopes in life. So in summation: They can salt my caramels and roast my banana anytime they want to. Bi-Rite Creamery FTW!

I was at Bi-Rite Creamery today for its grand reopening, and man, was I impressed.  They were very generous and let me try a whole bunch of flavors.  I ended getting a double with three flavors:   Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl, Salted Caramel, and Vanilla Malt with Peanut Brittle and Chocolate Pieces. I know Salted Caramel is the crowd favorite, but the Brown Sugar blew my mind.  I also tried Toasted Coconut, Mint Chip, and Ricanelas (cinnamon with crushed snickerdoodles).  All were pretty fabulous. The shop is tiny and I've heard the lines can get wicked long, but they were nonexistent at 2pm on a Wednesday.  I walked right in.  Also, I didn't see any real seating, and I really wouldn't bank on the small amount that is there.  You walk in, get up to the counter, order, and leave.  Absolutely a to-go place.   Staff was extremely friendly! Five stars for Bi-Rite.  I will definitely be coming back!

We hit Bi-Rite fifth in the Ice Cream Walk of the Damned.  I came off with a better impression than previous visits, probably because I sampled more flavors and avoided ordering a whole cone based on the novelty of the name. Ice Cream Texture : 4/5.  Varies between flavors - Brown Butter Pecan was delicious and creamy while Cinnamon was harsh. Flavor Variety : 4/5.  Lots of interesting flavors, but still a fair number that fall flat on my tastebuds (Balsamic, Snickerdoodle).  Not as experimental as Humphy Slocumbe but fewer crazy bombs. Customers : Dolores Park regulars, foodies from everywhere Strengths :  Good selection of novel yet tasty flavors Cons: Lineup, buskers, salivating regulars

Hands down my favorite flavor is SALTED CARAMEL! A must try! Majority of their other flavors are delicious and very unique as well, and they change every day. All of their ice cream is homemade, creamy, and the perfect temperature and texture. Even "normal" sounding flavors like balsamic strawberry are orgasmic. A little on the pricey side, but you get exactly what you pay for! Sample a few flavors and take a pint or two (or five) home. TIP: No need to line up if you're only purchasing pre-packed ice cream. Simple grab it from the fridge and go straight to the register. The line always looks long but it goes by faster than you think. Workers are extremely efficient and friendly. Another plus: they open til 10 or 11pm! But don't get your hopes up...there's usually still a line regardless of the time of day, weather, natural disasters, economy, you name it.

Let's face it - I'm not writing anything new that hasn't been said before (unless I'm writing a WTF one-star review here). The ice cream here is simply heavenly. These non-traditional flavors are divine and aren't just unique flavors for the sake of being unique. For $3.25, I got a single scoop of ice cream that could be split into two small scoops of two different flavors. After sampling as many flavors I could before feeling self-conscious about it, I decided upon the balsamic strawberry and salted caramel on an organic sugar cone. I can have tunnel vision when it comes to eating, but never have I been so engrossed in consuming ice cream as I was with the salted caramel. Now I know what Homer Simpson experiences whenever he lapses into his extended mmm/drooling sessions. Major pluses for local, sustainable and/or organic ice cream and environmentally-conscious business practices. Minus points for myself since I'd have to drive from afar to get a lick of heaven from BRC.

Every San Franciscan knows about this awesome place with the tastiest ice creams ever! The salted caramel was a favorite among many but my ultimate favorite would have to be the roasted banana and balsamic strawberry. Both flavors were fantastic and was probably one of the best ice creams I've ever had. It was soo tasty that we decided to buy 5 pints which were 7.99 each and brought them to our friends BBQ. If you're in the area or even if you're in SF visiting...I highly recommend you stopping by bi-rite to grab one of their delicious ice creams. Just be forewarned that the lines are pretty long but it's all worth it!

Finally, I got to experience Bi-Rite ice cream.  My friend used to live nearby, and I've even bought gift cards for her.  So when in SF, she had to take me there.  My brown sugar ice cream with ginger and caramel was delightful.  I also sampled my friend's pumpkin, which was rich and tasty.  The prune armagnac ("an Obama-era rum raisin", they called it) was a nice combination, too. And coffee toffee--no one can go wrong with that in my book. The ice cream is good quality, but I was especially impressed by the friendliness and enthusiasm of the staff. They were happy to chat, give samples, explain flavors, and let you take your time.  They were excited about ice cream and excited that you got to experience it.

Bi-Rite makes me happy. On my most recent visit, I got the single (1-2 flavors) - SALTED CARAMEL and TOASTED COCONUT on a sugar cone. $3.25 of heavenly goodness. I've also tried the Balsamic Strawberry and Honey Lavendar. My favorite flavor is Salted Caramel. I never even knew i was a fan of caramel! Good thing i dont live anywhere near the mission, otherwise I would become fat from all the ice cream i'll be eating from Bi-rite.

To experience Bi-Rite, please wait in line for at least 20 minutes, order salted caramel flavor on a cone, pay the cashier $2.25 for a kid's single scoop, and proceed out the door. This results in the most efficient flow of traffic for this little store. With your ice-cream cone in hand, please then proceed across the street to Dolores Park, enjoy your ice-cream as you people watch on a lovely sunny Sunday afternoon.

Didn't know I love ice cream so much until my husband and I moved into the mission and bi rite creamery is literally a 1 minute walk from our place. What more can I say about this place that other reviewers haven't said before? Well, if you can, buy the "Smores chocolate ice cream pie"!!! OMG, it is sooooooooo good. Located in the freezer section next to the register is this delicious gem! Soft marshmallow on top of chocolate ice cream filling with a salty caramel graham cracker crust! GET IT!

Jeezus.  SO good.   Since I'm not a fan of crazy ass lines (see my Ike's review), I've put off going to Bi-Rite for a very long time.  However, hubs and I finally had a random weekday off work, so we went at about 2:30ish, and only had a 5 minute line. I got Ricaneles (cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodle cookies) and salted caramel...hubs got toasted coconut and brown butter pecan.  All four flavors were phenomenal, but I will say that if you are trying multiple flavors and one of them is salted caramel, save that one for last...it's a pretty strong flavor and can take away from more subtle flavors like the toasted coconut. I still dream about Bi-Rite, and the next weekday I have off work so I can go back sans line....

Yeah yeah everyone and their hipster mother has reviewed this place. But Iiiiiiiii'm the one with something to say.  Meh, not really.  The ice cream is really good.  For as busy as the place is, our scooper was very friendly.  I wish I had done some sampling, but I was intimidated by the line behind me. R is a huge sorbet fan, she went with the raspberry.  I went salted caramel, which was good, but not amazing.  I wish there were more sea salt crystals in it.  The orange cardamom though, blew my socks off.  Delicate and tasty, the flavors played off each other very well.  Reminded me desserts at my aunt's Hindu wedding.  Excellent.

Passing by here the other day I saw a little girl slathered with sticky chocolate ice cream.  I think she missed a spot on her forehead.  Mom nor herself bothered to wipe off the mess, knowing full well another blob would paint her chin in a matter of seconds.   We passed the creamery and headed to its sister shop, the Bi-Rite Market.  Fancy!   After a bit of window shopping at the market and sampling on all the freebie produce, we saw that the line had since doubled!  k, let's be like lemmings and join the crowd.  Ooh cool... this aint your typical chocolate, vanilla, 'n strawberry place... although they do serve those favorites... some balsamic with your strawberry?  Shmancy! I was very interested in the Honey Lavender and got a sampling of that.  Ehhhhh... I think I'll save this combo for my skincare.  It tasted a lil bitter to me.  I asked for a rec and the scooperista said the Salted Caramel is the most popular one.  I dub that flavor Abracadabra, because they are the Magic Words to make me appear out of no where if mentioned.  I have a huge salt tooth... and my fav sweet is caramel.  How could I NOT get this?   My sister hates it when I smack my lips when eating and scolded me as I was enjoying my treat.  "I cant enjoy this w/o smacking, cuz it helps aerate my palate!!!!"  "Ok!  OK!  Smack on then, sheesh!"  Yee-aah!  Nyam nyem nyem!  Ooh, what will they come out with next?  Ketchupped Mango?  I'd smack that!

I am not your normal ice cream fan. I was vegan for four and a half years until recently and lets just say I am sensitive ice cream. This quality ice cream however left me feeling good all around after consumption. My taste buds were very pleased too. I chose salted caramel - since those flavors are so flirtatious and honey lavender ice cream since that flavor is so "me". I have only been here once and I crave it many times over. Maybe I will go back tonight. There is most often a line. Not too much room to eat inside but even on cold nights you will see people eating ice cream outside b/c its that good.

Awesomeness in a cup (or cone). Tried the salted caramel and apple pie - deliciously smooth caramel with a hint of salt, and crumbly and cool apple pie. So yummy. Both those were just the samples! I actually had a single of mint chip and cookies and cream. So rich, creamy, and full of chocolate flakes and large cookie chunks. I was amazed at how good the ice cream was. The mint even had a hint of herbal mint (the real deal, not fake artificial mint). Not much standing room, but very very good, and worth the trek.

There's no better way to enjoy a beautiful sunny day in San Francisco than with ice cream from Bi-Rite.  The lines are long, but It's definitely worth it.  Take that time to pick a flavor and play with the dozens of dogs that walk by.  :) My friends and I decided to split a pint of Salted Caramel at Dolores Park across the street.  But three of us went in to get the one pint so we could all get samples!  I tried Honey Lavender and the cinnamon/Snickerdoodle flavor, and both were absolutely amazing.  The Salted Caramel was delicious too, but I couldn't eat a lot of it because it's pretty rich and a bit sweet for my taste. I'm not the biggest ice cream person, but I'll be back for a scoop of Honey Lavender!

Finally got a chance to come back last night to give it another try. It was pretty cold/windy but there was still a line out the door when a friend and I got there! We didn't have to wait long and it gave us some time to decide what flavors we wanted to try. I didn't want to sample too many so I settled on the balsamic strawberry and their infamous salted caramel of course. The balsamic strawberry was much more pleasant than I thought it would be...it tasted mostly of fresh strawberries with a hint of balsamic. I would definitely come back to order this flavor. But I was determined to get the salted caramel this time around and it was absolutely fantastic! Not too sweet with the perfect notes of saltiness...it was heaven in my mouth. I LOVE caramel and it totally reminded me of the Werther's hard candies in ice cream form! I got the kid's size on a cone (you get more than in a cup) for $2.25...what a steal!

I don't suppose my review will move their markers much. People will always go, it's a legendary place, etc. Of course, nothing wrong with putting my own two cents in. I've always been known to do so. It's cathartic. We traveled across town to get here, wandered through some hipster areas, and made our way up to the counter. Greeted by fewer flavors than we were expecting, I settled on honey lavender. A home run - nom nom! In a conversation with the friend who sent us to Bi-Rite, she said the honey lavender was the only way to go. She was right. It was fragrant and full of flowery goodness, rather than just the essence ("Having the lavender waved over it," as a friendly old grandmother might say). My manfriend had the brown sugar-caramel-ginger thing and although it performed competently, he found it to be pedestrian for homemade ice cream. A notch above the branded stuff, to be sure, but not worthy of a place with over 2600 Yelp reviews, as of this writing. So if you go, get honey lavender. Can't vouch for anything else, but that's what all the other reviewers are for.

Hands down the best ice-cream place in all of SF. My favorite is their earl grey ice-cream. Coming in at second is the orange cardamom. The orange is more fragrant than the earl grey, but really tasty. I generally have one scoop of each. Afterwards, my burps feel like a perfume factory. The orange cardamom is pretty fragrant tee hee. I like it.   My friend swears by the honey lavender. Lavender is not my thing in general, both in cuisine and in smells. Can't wait to go back and try the roasted banana and salted caramel!

Being one of those that "left his heart in San Francisco", every trip back to the city merits an out of the way jaunt to Bi-rite creamery. The organic local ingredients, and biodegradable environmentally conscious staff would attract me anyway... but instead let us focus on what really makes one drive 20 minutes for this local taste of greatness. I'm all for the Brown Butter Pecan, Salted Caramel, Mint Chip, and good old plain Chocolate. But the real reason I stand here  scooping it up in 40 degree weather is for the Honey Lavender Ice Cream. Another one of the rare dishes that lives up to "yelp hype", this special flavor feels like a scoop of the lightest gelato, and tastes like... well I'm gonna say a "flower"(*1) not because I have a better metaphor, but because my sister used it and I'm stealing it. So yeah... make the trip. If the weather's hot, this will cool you down. If the weather's cold, well your freezing your ass off anyway, so pull out your biodegradable spoons and scoop up some honey lavender ice cream!! ...... Ok my sister is demanding to be credited for the metaphor... and since she did actually pay for the honey lavender goodness... here it is. *1 - Tina S.

I tried 3 different flavors from a silver spoon before deciding on a single cup serving. Final decision - Butter Pecan The ice-cream is homemade and so are their topping sauces like caramel, which is by the far the best caramel sauce I've had. Great, smiley workers and they offer ice-cream cakes and ice-cream sandwiches. I want to return for some more ICE-CREAM.

Unique, Super-refreshing and Good Location Unique- flavors like honey lavender, orange cardamon, cinnamon with snicker-doodles tingles both curiosity and taste buds. You can sample any ice cream; serving size is variable, the smallest you can still get 1-2 flavors, so if you can't decide what to have, why not have them both? Super-refreshing- okay. The way their flavor dissipates as the cream caresses ever so gently is definitely a plus, however, if you want the complete ice cream experience, just wait a while until it's a bit melted. (not too much though) I recommend walking across the street to Dolores Park. Enjoy the sun a bit while you savor the flavor. I love this ice cream place. All ice cream places should be like this. Well, except maybe they should also have model trains going everywhere. Yeah, that would be the ideal creamery.

After hearing such great things about this place and the famed honey-lavender ice cream, I thought that all the hype would inflate my expectations and leave me disappointed, but oh no no, i was not disappointed. Even on a non-holiday Monday afternoon, there was a line for the place! (Don't you people have to work?!) I got a scoop of the Malted Vanilla, full of goodies like peanut brittle and cookies?, and a scoop of the honey-lavender. Honey-lavender wins. It tasted so unique, so divine, so delicious. Usually, I'm skeptical about lavender flavored things, because the lavender taste is too overwhelming. Not this ice cream. It was perfect; it tasted like lavender but not like I was eating a mouthful of lavender leaves. It was just....good. I want to come back and try more flavors next time. Maybe even a sundae!

This place is absolutely delicious. I cannot believe I waited this long to try the ice-cream here. We came here on an overcast, but humid day . . . not the perfect ice-cream weather, but heck . . . I love me some good ice-cream. I had the coffee toffee and the roasted coconut. I hate drinking coffee, but I like all things coffee-flavored. I'm odd like that, and the coffee ice-cream here was strong, but oh-so-delicious! The coconut was nothing spectacular so I'll probably try another flavor next time. I dabbed into my friend's salted caramel, and it was a little too sweet for me. I'll probably pass on the Honey Lavender as well because everytime I try something lavender flavored, it ends up just tasting like soap in my mouth. This reminds me of The Christmas Story. Christmas Story is good; Lavender in my mouth . . . no bueno.

After lunch at Tartine, my friends and I walked over to Bi-Rite for some ice cream.  Lucky for us there was a line so we had time to digest.  I got the Balsamic Strawberry and the Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl.  The brown sugar was a bit sweet.  Yes, I know it's brown sugar, sugar is sweet...  but compared to the Balsamic Strawberry, it was just a tad overboard for me.  However, combined it was soOo good I really didn't want to share. My only gripe...  I got two single scoops which cost me $4...  however my single scoops really looked like kiddie sizes.  I think they need to get some girls with more arm muscle to really dig into those ice cream cause even though it's gourmet and delicious, I can't help but feel a tiny bit jipped.  Yah I know, it's not Scoops in LA... but dangit... I really thought they gave me kiddie sizes!!

I am torn between a 4 and 5 star rating, and as the saying goes, if Yelp allowed half stars.... BUT, I think I am going for four because of the incessant line & cramped nature of the quarters. I guess in this city you have to choose your #1 ice cream and I am going with Mitchell's for it's convenience (read:parking lot) and queuing quality.  My Operations Engineering brother would be so proud.  There don't seem to be as many flavor choices at Bi-Rite as well, and I actually prefer ice cream served ice cream style more than gelato-stizz.  Actually, Bi-Rite deserves their 4 stars! However, if Mitchell's were to, god forbid, be closed, Bi-Rite would be my next choice in terms of ice cream quality.

The great Bi-Rite hype is indeed true!!! Double scoop of Roasted Banana and Salted Caramel.  Deeeee-licious!  The ice cream is smooth, creamy and tastes o' so fresh!  Anhie T. ordered the Toffee Coffee and Toasted Coconut.  The Toffee Coffee is great for coffee lovers b/c it is very, very coffee tasting.  Not my cup o' tea.  Toasted Coconut was better than ANY coconut ice cream I've ever had.  Hands down the best!   Why four stars you may ask?  Parking, and the line to order.  But will that deter me from future visits?  I don't think so.... Tip o' the day.  Ask them to try the different flavors before ordering.  Don't feel bad about holding up the line.  Worst thing you can do is order some "weird" flavor and end up not liking it....coming home and signing on to Yelp and giving it one star!

Decided to wean myself from fro-yo and have actual ice cream. Went with some coworkers to Dolores Park and finally made a stop here. What I liked: -the honey lavender. The name was fruity and sounded like a body wash my gf would get at Body Shop, but this flavor is incredible. Almost tough to describe it, but it's that d*mn good. -the malted vanilla w/peanut brittle; great flavor, brittle almost tasted like a waffle cone. It's that mixture of sweetness and saltiness that makes America great -staff was friendly and gave samples. -I didn't have to suffer the plight of other friends/Yelpers and wait an eternity, I stood in line just under 3 minutes. -and you can't go wrong with a wooden ice cream spoon. Why it didn't get 5 stars: -actual size of the serving, a double for 3.25 is still somewhat small; I know my nephew would go through it in seconds and want more. -definitely bus or take BART, trying to find pkg around here is mayhem. But overall, I felt that Bi-Rite lived up to the hype. I ain't gonna start the whole Bi-Rite/Mitchell's debate, but I will say when out of towners visit, I'd be inclined to take them here as Mitchell's has always been crowded. And fyi, Bi-Rite has a great market just across the street.

With nearly 2,000 reviews, I'm not going to sit here and repeat every little thing that makes BiRite Creamery so great. No, I'm not going to sit here and tell you how yummy the balsamic strawberry ice cream sandwiched between two perfectly chewy, yet crispy sugar cookies is OR how, on even the hottest day, their (mixed berry) popsicles help you to stay in Dolores Park a few minutes longer OR how a sam's sundae seems totally weird with olive oil and salt slathered all over it but is one of the most interesting combinations I've ever had OR how, I KID YOU NOT, they make theeeeeee best pumpkin ice cream in the world (I definitely won't tell you I'm mad they only make this during the holidays). No -- I just won't do it -- I won't tell you that the workers totally accomodate my neurotic ways when I insist on standing in front of the freezer (only during non-peak hours!!) asking for a sample of every new flavor and sometimes a flavor I won't be able to fit in my cup that day OR when their freezer broke and I excitedly and unknowingly bought 3 pints (ginger, salted caramel, brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl) and ended up bringing my parents a salty, gingery, sugary soup, they happily exchanged all 3 the next day. No --  I'll save you the trouble and I won't waste my time...but I guess with 2,000 reviews, most of you know it by now anyway. P.S. One last thing I won't mention -- their beer ice cream tastes JUST like beer!

Uh, can we say YUM? A bit pricey? Yea. A bit pretentious? Maybe. Friggen delicious? Hell yea. The hardest part about coming here is deciding what flavors to get. I usually succumb to the 3 scoops. Salted caramel is a favorite, you can taste the burnt sugar notes with flecks of sea salt. I'd also recommend the ricanelas, cinnamon ice cream with chunks of chewy snickerdoodle cookies, SO GOOD.

Went to Bi-Rite yesterday for the first time...I am moving to the Mission tomorrow. There was no line on a breezy Tuesday night around 5:30 pm - guess we beat the after-work rush. The woman who worked there was SO nice and patient and kept giving us flavors to try until we had almost every single one, and also suggested which flavors would go best together. Protip: Honey Lavender + Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl. I don't even like caramel but this one had such a rich, smoky burnt taste that was impossible to resist. The Earl Grey flavor tastes like boba! I definitely had two scoops and then picked up a quart of salted caramel from the market down the street. It's just that good.

Surprise surprise! I actually came here on a warm day in San Francisco. How lucky of me! I was hanging out at Dolores Park with my girlies and there seemed to be a constant line outside Bi-Rite. When the sun was finally setting, we decided we had to get our ice cream before it got completely dark. And at around 7, there was NO line! Gasp! So I got the single size with honey lavender and balsamic strawberry. They didn't have my first choice which was raspberry somethin' sorbet. They guy wasn't friendly at all, but whatever. It was a nice day and he had to serve an endless line. My two flavors were good! I honestly can't say it's THE BEST THING EVER though.. at least not enough to lure me back for awhile.

I feel bummed that I discovered Bi-Rite ice cream just now... now that I am moving out of the city.  Bi-Rite is absolutely the best ice cream in San Francisco!  I have been living in the city for over 3 years now and my partner before we started cohabitating even lived a few blocks from Dolores Park along 18th St.  It's so sad that I did not get the chance to indulge on roasted banana, toasted coconut and salted caramel ice cream during the past three years.   I wonder how much it is to franchise this place.  Or do they even franchise?  Spreading Bi-Rite's ice cream goodness can be my real calling in life.

Mitchell's ice cream is an old time favorite.  I'm been going here for 16 plus years.  I love the ice cream here, and while I've tried several ice cream places over the years, nothing really compares to Mitchell's... until now. Sorry Mitchell's, but after 16 years of considering you my #1, I have strayed.  Please forgive me. What really sets Bi-Rite apart from most ice cream places is the oddball selection of off the wall flavors that work... and are quite tasty!  I mean who thinks of putting chocolate ice cream with olive oil and sea salt?  I was hesitant to try it, but damn... it was good!  My other favorite would have to be the salted caramel. Mitchell's will still always have a special place in my heart, but for now it's #2 to Bi-Rite.

I've been wanting to try BiRite ice cream for the LONGEST time.  Sadly, every time I was free to visit SF, it was a weekend and the lines are always rumored to be out the door, so I never bothered.  I was fortunate enough to come here with some friends yesterday evening.  Maybe it was the chilly weather, but we got there around 8:15pm.  No line. Got to try 4 different flavors. Salted Caramel is just as good as everyone says it is, but my favorite is the Earl Grey (surprisingly!).  I didn't like the honey lavender as much, but I'm not much of a lavender lady.  I also tried the malted vanilla w/ peanut brittle and chocolate... That was good too, but not as good as Earl Grey! lol. What I like most about the ice cream here is the texture and flavor which both remind me of a gelato consistency (kind of melty but not too melty and with a clear, distinct flavor).  I'd gladly wait in  line for 10-15 minutes. Otherwise, a pint would do since you don't have to wait in line to purchase one or two or three! A friend bought a pint and noted how the ice cream didn't get rock hard in his freezer and maintained its nice creamy consistency! woo hoo! A few other great things are their paper bowls and wooden tongue-depressor-like spoons!!!!! Eco-friendlyyyyy! We lucked out because after we got our ice cream, a line of about 10 people formed (i'm sure that's probably considered short by the usual standards!) Sigh. I want to get an ice cream cake from here!!!!

Best Ice cream I have had since the Cloverdale Ice Creamery in Fremont (childhood memory).   Brownie Sundae= Decadent semi soft brownie with textured crispy edges 1 scoop of roasted banana ice cream 1 scoop of cookies and cream ice cream lots of rich hot fudge poured on top home made whip cream (or its tasted like it... dream whip almost) a light drizzle of a savory caramel sauce ..... and I totally got my period an hour before ice cream HEAVEN AND HELL UNITE! WHICH MADE BROWNIE SUNDAE TASTE EVEN BETTER!!!

You have 1,210 reviews to go through, so I'll keep this short: Bi-Rite Creamery makes the best ice cream in the world. Period. Their secret - they start with Strauss Creamery's (West Marin organic dairy) ice cream blend. So does Three Twins and Scoop. But Bi-Rite's flavors top those other two, which are also stellar.

Yum... Bi-Rite.  My first time here the other day and I had some good ice cream!  I got Vanilla an the Toffee Coffee one.  I was surprised that this ice cream is not as sweet as other ice creams.  My go-to ice cream in general is cookies and cream and they did not have any this day!  Boo.. Anyhow, when we got there there was a line around the corner.  The line wasn't that long since Bi-Rite is near the corner.  My friends waiting in line while I waited the same amount of time to go use the bathroom.  Sigh, I really wish some establishments had two bathrooms.

Ok.. this place is a TEENSY bit overrated. The ice cream isn't worth the line nor the OMG BEST THING EVER tagline. Don't get me wrong, the ice cream is creamy and above average. The price is standard (around 3 dollars for a scoop). It just didn't blow me away. The flavors aren't even that unique. If you have been to Scoops in LA, those flavors are crazy (I had roasted rice white wine and it had a smoky taste to it, crazy stuff). I know, I'm not in LA, I'm in SF (not a LA fan btw). I guess I rather spend my 3 bucks on a pint of Ben and Jerry's which imo taste the same once thawed a bit. I tried the salted caramel and didn't like it. I'd give it two stars. I know, you all are thinking, SHE'S NUTS! It tasted a bit burnt, like it's TOO bitter. Their raspberry white chocolate, on the other hand, tasted way better. It's very silky creamy and just the right amount of sweetness. I have also tried strawberry balsamic.. I don't remember raving about it. I think I was a bit disappointed. I guess it must not have been that good (or bad) if I can't even remember it right? Bottom line: I'll come back if I'm in the area (and is feeling ice cream) but I won't take any detours to come back.

Don't let parking keep you away...that problem isn't Bi-Rite's fault!   Rain or shine, go and enjoy yourself with a scoop or two of quality made ice cream.   Tip - ice cream tastes so much better with great company...and fudge or caramel ;)

I love savory-sweet combinations, and Bi-Rite has perfected the art of savory-sweet ice cream flavors.   Example 1: Salted Caramel A sweet, toasted, almost burnt caramel taste with a hit of saltiness. Bi-Rite's most famous flavor for a reason! Example 2: Honey Lavender Subtly sweet honey ice cream with the surprising perfumey hint of lavender on the back end. Example 3: Sam's Sundae Chocolate ice cream with bergamot olive oil, maldon sea salt and whipped cream. First, you taste the sweet, rich chocolate ice cream. Then, the savory richness of olive oil. Next, the surprising crunch of salty sea crystals. And lastly, the delicate lightness of whip cream. So many strange flavor profiles at once, but it just works. I feel like I'm combining dinner and dessert in one with this sundae. And for days when I'm craving the ultimate sweet-sweet, I throw Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl into the mix.

Bi-Rite Creamery ice cream is the best I've had in a long time. Go for the Mint Hill (Lavender & Honey) or the Salted Caramel.

I'm usually a plain vanilla bean kind of girl... but I've had some really good ice cream, and this place makes my top ten.  The flavors are rich, clean and just delicious.  A little bit of this stuff goes a long way.  I've tried almost all of their flavors from '07...and my top favorites are coffee toffee, and sometimes the salted caramel, which makes the taste buds dance! Some day, I'll actually try their other goodies...

I am one of the very few people that doesn't love ice cream. That said, today I was helping out at my friend's shop located next to Bi-Rite.  All day I watched people lining up with total anticipation for their ice cream. By late afternoon I simple couldn't resist any longer. I made my way into the line. I ordered a honey lavender cone for myself and a cookie's-n-cream for my gf. The ordering experience was a little chaotic but the ice cream was down right delicious!! It's a habit I don't plan to pick up but if I am in the hood it is highly likely that I'll be back.

Bi-Rite earns a very solid 3.5 stars. I like this place.  I like it a lot, but I can't find it in myself to LOVE the place.  Yes, the salted caramel is fantastic.  The honey lavender is sweet and creamy.  Their brown butter pecan is old-fashioned and quite good. The toffee/coffee is a delicious combination.  The homemade toppings are great too.  Although the long lines move quickly, there's something about the Bi-Rite Creamery that lacks sincere, friendly service and doesn't peak at the top of my list for when I crave ice cream.  I have to admit, my top ice cream destination is still Bombay Creamery around the corner, but I have a big heart and Bi-Rite is a close second!

"People are talkin, talking bout people I hear them whisper, you wont believe it." Let's just say if Bi-Rite were my lover, I'd be one hellavuh lucky lady. Anyhoo Bi-Rite reminded me of this song because people are always talking about this place. I mention Mitchell's and I hear a collective groan in unison from the group, but you say Bi-Rite and everyone is taken to this magical place where it is not just a creamery but a dreamery. The first time I went here was just a few weeks ago, and then I had to go 2 weeks in a row. I started with the salted caramel and balsamic strawberry. I love me some caramel and especially salted caramel, so this was completely drool worthy. What's cool is that they use real spoons for the taste samples, and are very green in general, what's bad is the line is always forevers and a day. But for the most part it's worth it. Even on the coldest day in the city there will be a line out the door for the deliciousness. Definitely the best ice cream place in the city that I've discovered so far.

Woohoo! It is as good as it gets! Believe the hype, the ice cream here is homemade but made with love. You can definitely taste it and the richness of the ice cream. My favorite flavors have been the vanilla, caramel and my most favorite is the strawberry balsamic flavored ice cream. There is always a long line at Bi-Rite but there have been instances where there has been no line. Those are my favorite days because sometimes I can't wait for it but I always end up doing so. The staff is great and doesn't mind you sampling flavor after flavor. My punch card is getting filled up and it's definitely a great way to keep me coming back. Bi-Rite, you are the best!

Finally! I got the chance to taste the infamous Bi-Rite ice cream. It was a cold and windy night in the City. Before hitting up some bars, my gal pals and I had a craving for Ice Cream and made it a point to come here. Parking was a biznatch and walking uphill against the strong gust made our craving for ice cream quite a journey. Nevertheless, I was happy with the end product: Roasted Banana and Snickerdoodle on a sugar cone! It was amazing...orgasm in my mouth. At that point, I didn't care how cold it was outside, I wanted more! Other flavors I sampled: Balsamic strawberry- Nyeh, tasted like regular strawberry to me. Perhaps my taste buds aren't sophisticated enough to pick up on the balsamic part. Honey Lavender- Great to sample, but a little too overwhelming to have a whole serving. Cute little place. The staff rocks. Ice cream- heavenly.

Salted caramel ice cream anyone?  Fricken' awesome! Came here with friends after being told by other friends that it was a 'must-visit' spot.  Not disappointed. Service was fast and friendly -- the guy in front of me immediately dropped his ice cream cone before paying and they quickly made him a new cone without any complaint. Lots of unique flavours -- next time I'm looking to try the lavender ;-)

I once waited 10 min in line and got salted caramel & roasted banana ice cream. After taking a couple bites, I decided that I needed more, so I got back in line, and by the time I reached the front, I was done and ready to get more. Basically, I love this place and all the flavors I've tried here (even the more normal ones like mint chocolate and white chocolate raspberry), but my all time favorite is roasted banana. Oh wait, I'm not that big of a fan of the honey lavender, since I feel like I'm eating body lotion or something. Maybe ask them for a sample before you get a scoop to see if you have that same reaction.

Doesn't look like this place needs another 5-star review, but I'll go for it anyway.  Came here on a whim since the aroma of freshly made waffle cones brought us in.  Had a "make your own sundae" and almost made myself sick because it was SOOO good that I could not stop eating!   This place is amazing and you MUST go if in the neighborhood.

Deeeeeeeelectable! The only three commonly seen ice creams offered here are vanilla, chocolate and cookies and cream, the latter of which I've tried and it's really good. At 7.99 per pint, I couldn't bring them all home but I did choose salted caramel and toasted vanilla/peanut brittle/chocolate. OMG - WOW!

I walked by this ice cream joint at about 6pm and it took me a grand total of about 2 seconds to decide if I wanted to ruin my appetite by eating sweets right before dinner. The server was great and allowed us to try almost all the flavors. What's cute is that they let you taste with metal spoons, but you get a wooden tongue-depressor like spoon when you actually make a purchase. I LOVE the honey lavender one. It's tastes like lavender earl grey tea with a spot of honey. I partnered this with a scoop of salted caramel, which went well with the sweetness of the honey lavender. I didn't like the saltiness as much on its own. This place is the ice cream place of choice because they actually offer seasonal ice creams. The one for fall is the brown sugar ginger caramel one - tasty tasty tasty. Other flavors of note are the roasted banana, and Ritual's coffee toffee.

Bi-Rite Creamery is as good as it gets!!! I haven't had a chance to try all its flavors, but the two I can recommend is the "honey lavender" and the "salted caramel" At times, you may have trouble finding parking, but at the end the trip is all worth it to try its amazing flavors. All the flavors really stand out. Its all very creamy and soft... almost perfect! San Francisco Certified!

Finally checked out the soft serve ice cream last night, and I was surprised how un-creamy it was.  It tasted kind of icy ... like iced milk.  I asked the window girl (who was super nice despite the fact that she was freezing her butt off -- by the way, they should give her a window that she can shut so she doesn't DIE of exposure back there!) about it, and she assured me that it was ice cream but explained that it had less milk fat than the hard pack.  I think, though, that if it has less milk fat it wouldn't be ice "cream" .. it WOULD be ice milk, right? Anyway.  It was okay, but not fabulous.  I do, however, appreciate how they change their soft serve menu each day.  Despite that, I'll stick to the hard pack next time.

So after a day filled with Impressionistic art, I wanted ice cream. I managed to convince the bf to take me to Bi-Rite as we've never been there before. We bumped into a friend at the end of a fairly short line and hung out for a bit. The BF made his own mix while I tried the Salted Caramel, Honey Lavender, and Cinnamon. OMG. HAPPINESS IN A CUP. The Honey Lavender was sweet and creamy while the Salted Caramel had a slight burnt ending. But, unexpectedly, my favorite was the Cinnamon one. It was rich and light and just OMG! delicious. You can pick up pints of their ice cream as well. The workers are fast and friendly so the line moves pretty quickly. A must go to as their ice cream is amazing!

Already stuffed from dinner, our friend asked us if we wanted to grab dessert. Hello, there's only one right answer to that question.  ;) So we made our way to Bi-Rite Creamery and ...OMG, ice cream never tasted this good! It makes me sad thinking how far away Bi-Rite is. And when I'll be able to have it again. :( The salted caramel + butter pecan combo was to die for. Sweet, buttery, nutty goodness for your mouth. It was so good I tried to convince my friends to go back the following day (didn't happen). And then again the day after that (didn't happen). Why do my friends not appreciate gourmet ice cream? It's worth the hour long drive from San Jose!

The first time somebody gave me a taste of the famous Bi-Rite Creamery's ice cream, I was like, "Blechhhhh." The flavor they got was something involving candied ginger and blackberries. This may be somebody's idea of a yummy treat, but it's definitely not mine. A few years later, I gave it another chance, and ordered their salted caramel and coffee toffee flavors, and I gotta tell you -- I am in LOVE. These two flavors alone would rock my world, but together, they just about put me in a daze. Mitchell's, you have been outdone.

This place is so good, it makes me want to cry knowing that I live in London and it's so far away. We were recommended this place by a lovely guy in the Sunglasses Hut in the Castro, and he was spot-on with this place. I had the balsamic strawberry (as he suggested) and the roasted banana. It was amazing. I repeat, AMAZING. Take it from someone who a) loves ice cream and b) goes to Italy a lot to eat ice cream, this place is totally worth a visit and it makes my heart break that I got a taste and it was fleeting, but worth every second of full fat heaven.

Finally I got to try the much talked-about ice cream parlor!  I've read a lot about the salted caramel flavor, but I was tempted with the toffee coffee.  And being a coffee fiend, toffee coffee won.  Strong, bold coffee taste with the crunch and sweetness from the toffee made a good combo.  I had a bite of the salted caramel and I think the caramel flavor is too overpowering for me.  I also sampled the brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl, and again, the caramel was too sweet for me. The line is well worth the wait if you're not in a rush. The honey lavender, toasted coconut and pumpkin flavors will give me an excuse to come back!

Well I really am not sure how they've been doing in the coldest winters in the Bay Area in recent years but What's to say about this place and its divine and ideal placement after a sunny day at the park.  At first taste I blanched at the olive oil and sea salt on ice cream but yet many weeks after the last really hot day in the Bay Area I find myself hunkering for it.

OH MY GOD! I know I say this a lot when I eat ice cream, but seriously, I think I just died and went to heaven!! Ice cream here is so delicious. And oddly enough, it's kind of fluffy, light, and airy. Delicious, but kind of a shame since I could eat a gallon in like 5 minutes without having a stomach ache. I love the burnt caramel ice cream, especially with some toffee and caramel sauce. Also, the berry sundae is epic. Some of the flavors sound a bit odd, but somehow they made it work. Don't be shy, ice cream here is to die for, and the staff is fairly helpful and kind. They make it easy to go into ice cream coma and dream heavenly things.

You're lucky you lived up to the hype and surpassed my expectations, Bi Rite. After months of delays of wanting to try this place, I finally made it, and I decided to bring 3 buddies along. Granted the weather was cold and it was damn near 9:30 in the evening, this place was still poppin'. Guess any weather is good weather for their ice cream. I mean there were couples, families, and hungry groups of friends like us. I could easily see why lines can be long during peak hours and hot days. Now I didn't sample anything before I made my order, but I did notice how they use metal spoons to give out samples. Props for thinking about the environment. With so many damn flavors, it was hard to choose what I wanted, and they all looked good. I'm not gonna lie, I like my plain vanilla, but I didn't come all the way from the east bay to have it here. I like how the sizes they offer have 2 sets of scoops to chose from. For example, the large (which I got... don't judge) allows you to get 2 or 3 scoops. I'm trying as much as I can here, so of course I'm gonna cop 3 scoops. I ended up ordering the salted caramel, brown sugar, and honey lavender. The salted caramel was good, but kinda strong. I guess its cool that the aftertaste stays on your tongue for awhile. The brown sugar was good too, but wasn't as flavor-packed as I expected. My favorite out of the 3 scoops was definitely the honey lavender. The best way to describe it is like its.... bathroom potpourri in your mouth? Well, that's what I thought it was. Take it as a good thing, honey lavender was money. I also sampled my friends' ricanelas and balsamic strawberry, and those were rather delicious too. What's funny is that after eating all my ice cream, I didn't feel bloated or guilty haha. It would have been nice to have a bottle of water handy though. Bi Rite has easily become a favorite of mine due to the quality of the ice cream, the variety of unique flavors, and the flexibility in scoops. They also take credit card! I really look forward to my next visit so I can either get more scoops of new flavors or even a sundae. Woot.

Two weeks ago, I had the honey lavender.  When I found myself back in the Mission this past week, I knew I had to stop in for some salted caramel.  Honestly, how can anyone ever eat Dreyer's ice cream after having Bi-Rite?  I wouldn't even be able to tell you.

Pretty damn good.  I think volumes can be said about the milk they make it from (I love Strauss Family milk).  I really like the Ice Cream Sandwiches...especially the chocolate one with mint ice cream.  The macaroon one is good.  I like their coffee ice cream, but I am told they only have coffee toffee now... which is a bummer.

There are 3 ways to win me over. Give me some ice cream, give me some cookies or give me some cake. Really that's all you need. Bi-Rite definitely has some bomb ass ice cream. I'm not sure how to describe it exactly...maybe its the cream they use...but the ice cream is so creamy yet not overly heavy. The other night, I was lucky enough to have the bro-in-law bring back a pint from Bi-Rite. Why hellooo you Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces of yumminess! I told myself I just wanted a tablespoon of the ice cream...but after the first bite i HAD HAD HAD to get another bite.  4 spoonfuls later I stopped myself.

Thank you YELP and fellow Yelpers for letting us know about this wonderful place! Seriously the best ice cream I have ever had! Some friends and I had seen this place on Yelp and wanted to try it, but I have to admit I was a little leary it would live up to all the hype. I can now safely report that yes, it does live up to the hype. Why can't Dublin have good places like this? A group of friends and I stopped in one day last week and thank goodness it wasn't busy. All four of us were Bi-Rite virgins so we took quite a bit of time ooohing and aahhing over the different flavors. We each sampled 4-6 of the flavors with no hesitation from the guy behind the counter, he was so super nice.  I love how they give samples on real spoons, so environmentally friendly. I tried the Magnolia Coffee Porter, Roasted Banana, Toasted Coconut, Salted Caramel, Ricanela's (a cinnamony ice cream with snicker doodles) and some other flavor with a ginger caramel swirl.  They were all so amazing I couldn't decide what to get. I eventually ended up with Salted Caramel, Ricanela's and Cookies and Cream...all so wonderful! A little piece of creamy, sweet heaven on earth! It was like having Grandma's fresh home made ice cream, but with amazing flavors. Seriously, believe the hype...this place is THAT good!

Damn, this place is really that good! After hearing so much about this place I told some friends how awesome this place is (a little white lie) and that this place is a must visit.   They went and loved it so much that they brought me back some lavender ice cream. That's right, I got free ice cream brought to me. No waiting in that long line. There is a downside to all of this, I've got a new vice and that vice is Bi-Rite ice cream. I've gotten my first taste and there's no going back.

Friendly and feel good stop near Dolores Park, but the lines can get a little long from the looks of things after I left. I got the salted carmel and chocolate which my scooper assured me was an excellent combination.  And lo and behold it was!! The salted caramel was particularly good, the chocolate good but a bit gritty for my taste.  This place is good, but maybe a tad overrated.  About 3.5 stars from me, but I'll round up to four.

This is one of those places where you wish you knew about a long time ago. Heard all the hype about this place from my friends so I thought i'd try it out myself. At first when we got there, i was tryin to imagine how these flavors would taste because they were not your ordinary flavors. So, i settled for the salted caramel, brown sugar, and ricanelas which is pretty much a snickerdoodle. DAMN. I was shocked with all the flavor this freakin ice cream put out. Brown sugar tho was kinda blah after tasting the other 2. But other than that, it was all good. Also tried the balsamic strawberry (yum), malted vanilla (super yum w/ rice crispies inside), and chocolate coconut. (ok).  They take credit card! woo pah! I look forward to trying out other flavors esp their sundaes and coffee toffee. Definitely would recommend this place to ANYONE who loves ice cream.

Chocolate Ice Cream. Check. Bergamot Olive Oil. What? Sea Salt? Ummm... Yes folks, these are the ingredients for their well-known "Sam's Sundae" and if you haven't had it yet - GO AND TRY IT!! I was once a skeptic but I finally gave in after my bf begged me to share it with him (he saw it on TV and the person eating it said it was the BEST sundae she ever had..EVER).  I know, olive oil and salt in ice cream?? It is SOOO GOOD!! The flavors of the bergamot and salt mixed in with the chocolate ice cream was AMAZING!!!!   In addition, BiRite also has an amazing selection of fab flavors such as ricanelas and brown butter pecan (just to name a few).  There can be a long line here sometimes, but the wait is so worth it for this ice cream.  For those who like popsicles better, they also have some available and they are just awesome.  Their cookies and brownies are also delicious :D Love this place, and I bet you will too.

This is absolutely, positively, certainly a MUST try if you spend any time in San Francisco. I have been on a bit of an ice cream frenzy lately, and there is hardly anything better than salted caramel, honey lavender or, well, anything else at Bi-Rite. I'll spare you further editorializing and leave you with this: GO TO BI-RITE AS SOON AS YOU READ THIS AND GET YOURSELF A SALTED CARAMEL CONE! You can thank me later!

I'd heard great things about Bi-Rite so we stopped in for a scoop before heading to Dolores Park for a little sunshine. Great location, well priced, epic creamy, cold, crunchy goodness.  I ordered a scoop of Honey Lavender and a scoop of Mint Chocolate Chip.  he lavender was really amazing and very unique, light, sweet, YUM.  The mint was really good, nothing revolutionary but the combo was spot on.  The sugar cone was great, too.   It's been awhile since I had a fantastic ice cream cone and Bi-Rite did NOT disappoint.

Sunny Sunday afternoon, the line was around the block. It moved pretty quickly - 20 minutes. I had the vegan chocolate in a gluten-free cone. The vegan chocolate came in a close second to my all time favorite Luna & Larry Organic Coconut Bliss Chocolate Ice Cream. It was really nice having a gluten free/milk free cone. I also bought the watermelon popsicle. My 1 year old ate the whole thing by himself. He would not let it go. It was delicious and fresh.

Goddamn is that delicious ice cream. It's not good enough that I got 2 scoops of awesome in a cup. No, I had to get an extra little taste of the peanut butter swirl ice cream as well. Mint Chip - rich with lots of mint flakes. It's imperative that I get mint flakes in every spoonful so I had to do a little mixing of the ingredients myself, but no points off for that. Cinnamon Snickerdoodle - I'm a huge fan of cookie dough ice cream, but I had no idea I would like this one with bits of cookie in it. Delightful. Love it every which way.

Came down here on Tuesday night.  It was warm and a nice way to end the evening. I picked honey lavender.  It hit just the spot.  Sweet and floral, but not too sweet where I couldn't finish it.  comes in kiddie scoop, single, double and so on.  Also got to try my cousin's roasted banana and that was good.  They seem to have weird flavors like Balsamic Strawberry and Soy Chocolate, but they end up tasting really good!  We will def. be back next week!

OH MY GOSHHH. So good. I love specialty ice cream places! I think this place is even better than Scoops in LA. I had a ginger  something ice cream and even though I despise ginger, I loved this!!! It was perfectly creamy, and so fresh. You could definitely tell it was made in house and recently. The people are so nice and they let you have as many samples as you want. Roasted Banana was also TO DIE FOR!!!!! Love it. Check out pictures of what I ate here: http://une-deuxsenses.bl…

Bi-rite is a cute, fun ice cream shop that's definitely worth a visit! Nice place to grab a cone before having a picnic at Dolores Park. I tried: Balsamic Strawberry. You taste a slight tartness, but the rest of it is pretty much strawberrylicious. Honey Lavender tasted like a sweet, pleasant shove into a never-ending field of lavender. Coffee Toffee. I love coffee anything. So this was amazing. The ice cream had great, creamy texture, but I wasn't completely blown away. I'm probably not mature enough to understand the tasteful palette of great ice cream. +1 for the creative flavors.

You know the ice cream here is fantastically amazingly awesome when...it is freezing outside, there is a line out the door, and dozens of shivering people are savoring every last bite of Bi-Rite on the sidewalk.  Needless to say, this is one of my favorite ice cream places and totally worth the wait.   My regular faves are salted caramel, coffee toffee (made with freshly roasted coffee!), roasted banana, & toasted coconut.  I also tried the seasonal curry flavor at some point - not bad but definitely not for everyone. Ice cream is served with compostable cups and spoons so yes, you can toss your trash in the green compost bins that line 16th street. ;)

My go-to spot for ice cream in SF.  Lucky for me, it's "walking distance" from my place in Hayes Valley (I say "walking distance" because my friends visiting from LA didn't think 1.5 miles qualified as walking distance.) Excellent selection - obviously known for their Salted Caramel (even more-so now since being mentioned on the 7x7 list.)  They have other interesting flavors such as Ginger (my personal favorite - very light and palate-cleansing), Earl Grey Tea, and Roasted Banana.  They even have a couple vegan options for you lactards out there. The texture was interesting - one of my friends described it as being "icy-creamy" which was pretty spot on.  Definitely not as creamy as Mitchell's. Definitely worth waiting in line (which can stretch half a block down Dolores on some days.)  Brownie points being San Franciscan and having compostable cups and spoons before it was mandated by the city earlier this summer.

Date/Time:   Sunday - 4:45pm Occasion:    Early evening snack Party of:   Four Ordered:   Salted caramel ice cream Location:   Small little creamery, very crowded; lines go outside to the corner Total incl gratuity:   ~$4 for a scoop with cone Granted that I'm not a dessert kind of gal, this place actually ranks pretty high up there.  I came here with a group of friends after brunching at LIME.  We stood in line for about 30 minutes...yeah, for ice cream!  The salted caramel ice cream is listed on the 100 must eats in SF so I decided to give it a try.  It is a tasty flavor - not too sweet, which is good for me.  My friend got the earl grey tea flavor while the other got some chocolate sundae.  I dabbled into both.  Not bad though I preferred my caramel flavor one.  It's good and I'd say worth waiting in line for.

BEST ICE CREAM I HAVE EVER TASTED IN MY 21 YEARS AND 9 MONTHS OF EXISTENCE! please try all the flavors..because the people who work here are nice enough to share alittle. Must try: Salted Caramel and Honey Lavender All the other flavors are all good too so there is no wrong choice! after walking back to the car, which was awhile and 3 blocks down..i can hear people moan out loud and somewhat growl about how good the ice cream tasted..totally a life changing moment in the ice cream world..

I'm in love with Bi-Rite, which pairs fantastic flavor with great service. Line up once for the experience. Didn't think a scoop of ice cream (or three) could ever merit such a long line? It's definitely worth the wait, even in the chilly evening San Francisco weather. Parking is difficult on the weekends, so arrive early! They always switch up their flavors, so skip the classics and go for a flavor you wouldn't normally try! I promise you'll be surprised. So far I love the balsamic strawberry, earl grey, honey lavender, olive oil and pumpkin. I'm usually a big sorbet fan, but in Bi-Rite's case I like the cream flavors better. Not too sweet, with just the right amount of creaminess that makes you crave another bite. It's possible to walk in and buy a take-home pint/quart if you don't want to wait in line. A dangerous choice of purchase, I tell you!

Licking a cone of honey lavender ice cream while watching the sun set over the city at Mission Dolores park? Magic indeed. So this is really not a review, but a love letter to bi-rite. Dear bi-rite creamery, you make me happy when skies are gray. You delight my taste buds and tickle my fancy. You surprise and enchant me with your delectable, creative, genuine flavors. You light up my life. Sincerely, Taylour

Salted-caramel ice cream is the best ice-cream I've ever had.   Sadly, I can't find anything like it in Texas. I regret not trying the honey lavender...next time! My really awesome hosts took me here before dinner at La Trappe.  We were all supposed to share a small ice cream for taste but after trying the salted caramel, I ordered my own serving.  Though my stomach felt like it was going to explode later that night, it was worth it.   SO WORTH IT. Not like a lot of ice cream places do it, but they don't skimp on the serving.  They give so much that even if you're eating the ice cream at brain-freeze speed, it'll still drip.

YUM!!!!  This is the best ice cream ever!  I am so happy that I discovered Bi-Rite Creamery.  Too bad it's so far away from me, or I'd be coming here all the time.   We got here late on a foggy afternoon, so the line was out the door, but it wasn't too crazy long.  Anyway, it moved really fast, and I needed the extra time to decide which flavors I wanted to try!  I ended up trying the salted caramel, which everyone raves about, honey lavender, pomegranate sorbet, and malted (toasted?) vanilla.  The salted caramel was really good with a lot of depth of flavor, but for me it was just a little too sweet.  The pomegranate sorbet was good too, but I generally like creamy ice cream better than sorbet.  I loved the honey lavender and especially loved the malted vanilla with peanut brittle.  WOW.  So good!!  You can really taste the quality of the ingredients they use (I think they use milk from Strauss Creamery). Too bad they don't sell this stuff at Whole Foods or something.   I can't wait to go back!

Absolutely the best ice cream ever! The honey lavender tastes just like a spa.  And the mint chocolate and coffee are amazing as well. If ever you want an ice cream cake, Bi-Rite is quite accommodating.  Don't expect any frosting on it though, as it's just ice cream on cake.  Not expensive as other cakes in the area so definitely worth the visit.  All in all, very good stuff.

Big fan of this place.  Have been there twice in the past week. 1st experience:  had the honey lavendar and the earl grey.  Honey lavender tasted like I was eating a flower (too much lavender) and I would recommend the honey lavender from Ici in Berkeley over this one.  Earl Grey was fantastic. 2nd experience:  stood in line for 20 minutes to buy 2 pints and then was told I didn't need to stand in line to buy pre-packed ice cream. next time I will remember that.  I bought the banana and vanilla.  both were fantastic. best banana flavored ice cream i've ever had. all-in-all. great service, cool seating, good ice cream.

I tried the Balsamic Strawberry, Honey Lavender and Salted Caramel.  Balsamic Strawberry = how could you go wrong with strawberry, this was delicious; Honey Lavender = reminded me of some skincare product infused with lavender - this flavor left a pleasant aftertaste, but I have to be honest, it didn't go well with the other two flavors - for your highest tasting pleasure, it should be enjoyed by itself; Salted Caramel = if you like salty and sweet at the same time, this flavor is for you - it took me a few moments to get used to it, as my brain kept telling me isn't ice cream supposed to be just sweet?  But later on, I understood how it can become quite addicting.   When I arrived here @ 11am on a sunny Saturday morning (the time it opens for business), there were only 3 people in line before me.  The lady who took my order was very sweet and all smiles!  I definitely look forward to returning here again and trying the Roasted Banana, Toasted Coconut and Earl Grey flavors next time around.  Great that it is located next to Dolores Park - that is a very pleasant park to be at.  And come here by public transportation if you can; don't stress yourself out in finding parking around this area.  It's a shame that I used to live only a few blocks away from this place but had never gone until now. . .  This is by far the best place I've found to get ice cream in SF.

I haven't Yelped in a long time, but after visiting this place I was inspired to Yelp again. BEST.ICE CREAM.EVER. So good that I had to use Caps and periods. The line was ridiculously long but my friend had a genius idea of buying a couple of pints and sharing. That way we get to try different flavors.  Now if you're buying pints instead of individual scoops, you get to bypass the line and go right up to the front and order. I believe pints were about $7 or $8. We ordered: Salted Caramel, Coffee Toffee, Ricanelas and Malted Vanilla.  I honestly cannot tell you which is my favorite and I'm getting brain freeze just thinking about it.

Anyway, Salted Caramel needs no more praise... it's damn good.  But the Roasted Banana was also delicious!  So I just want to give it a little extra special attention.  It actually tasted like roasted banana (not funky cardboard)... it was creamy, smooth, and delicious.   What can I say, I love bi-rite!

This was high on my list of places we missed last year, so I was rather excited on arriving here. It's doubly exciting because this was to be Ainsley's first taste of ice cream. I started with Roasted Banana. Intense banana flavor, dark brown flavor, and it is just beautiful. It's one note played perfectly. Next was Brown Butter Pecan. I love butter pecan ice cream in general. I've been anticipating what nice dark notes browning the butter might accomplish. I was slightly disappointed on that front: if the butter was browned much before this batch was made, it doesn't appear to change the taste of the ice cream much from what I expected. Still, it's a really good incarnation of butter pecan. Next up, Orange Cardamom. There are floral notes to the orange flavor that pair very nicely with the cardamom, which is fairly understated by comparison. I would absolutely order this again, though, as it's a lovely counterpoint to the fourth flavor, Salted Caramel. The first bite of this flavor had me hooked. It is intensely burned sugar with some surprising and welcome bitter notes. In fact, this is probably the most intense caramel flavor I've had, bar none. Some of that is likely due to the salt, but it's seems mostly intended. That they get a flavor that strong to show up in a frozen dessert is impressive enough, but it showing up in a dairy dessert, which has a tendency to dampen the intensity of most flavors, is absolutely noteworthy. And, although Ainsley clearly enjoyed the banana and orange cardamom flavors, she really seemed to enjoy the caramel. Mom and I agreed.

Fresh and pure ice cream and sorbet handmade at the Bi-Rite Creamery (started by the same folks as the Bi Rite Market down the street).  It's great anytime, but best go on a chilly foggy San Francisco evening, and get a scoop of the salted caramel or brown butter pecan flavor.  The cold inside makes you feel warmer on the outside, or something like that. For a little show, order a banana split that they blowtorch right in front of you.  And why not get dessert here instead of hogging the damn tables all night long at Pizzeria Delfina (as the party of three in front of us did the other night - are you sure you don't want a third dessert or cup of coffee?  How about running through those vacation photos again?  Sheesh, get a clue people, the place is tiny and people are starving!) Anyway, sorry, I digress.  Bottom line, this place is quality, I loved the natural ice cream and will be back.  Four stars, pretty darn good.

After many months of having you in my bookmarks taunting me with your creamy deliciousness, Bi-Rite, we finally meet. You continue to taunt me with your long lines that wrapped around the corner on a beautiful day in the city. I get handed one of the menus and all the flavors sound sublime. I wish I had 3 stomachs so I could try everything. I narrowed it down to two. Salted Caramel and Roasted Banana. But before getting my single scoop with these two flavors though, I was able to sneak in a taste of the cookies n' cream. It was really tasty and almost made me change my order. After getting my ice cream, I sat on the wooden benches outside and dug my little wooden paddle into the salted caramel. Super delicious and bursting with flavor. I can see why so many people order it. I make my way through a bit of the caramel in order to reach the roasted banana scoop underneath and it was awesome as well. Delicious stuff. Will have to come see you again Bi-Rite. Until next time.

This place is by far the best place for ice cream in the city and perfectly situated in the mission where it's actually warm most of the time.. Not like the outer sunset where I live..

I really don't know what to add - but I think that the more great reviews you see on here - the better sense you get of how great the ice cream is!  One suggestion: share the brownie sundae, or you might explode.  Also, you might want to refrain from smearing whipped cream on the face of the person you are on a first date with, when he isn't looking.  It's better for eating! This place isn't to be missed.

I just don't get what all of the fuss is about over this place. I mean, it's great that they use fresh ingredients and organics, but... the flavors seem to be trying-too-hard-to-be-different-and-hip to me, and don't actually TASTE all that good. I was out of the country when the shop opened, so perhaps I just missed the excitement and hype, and that needs to be part of it. I pick Mitchell's over this any day of the week and twice on sundays.

This review is for the chocolate chip cookie ONLY.  I'm lactose intolerant and therefore unable to enjoy the ice cream here. I believe that Bi-Rite Creamery bakes the 2nd best chocolate chip cookie in San Francisco.  Unlike the ubiquitous buttery/chewy Toll House style that mainstream Americans seem to fall over each other for, the good folks at Bi-Rite have created a very unique cookie.  It seems to have a high walnut content, although the nuts are lovingly chopped almost to the consistency of granola - a very nice touch, since I'm convinced that the "chunky walnut" craze that has a death grip on pop culture here in the States is in fact the result of laziness, plain and simple.  (Yes, I'm talking to you Mission Beach Cafe Cookie Chef.) There is also a deeply satisfying note of molasses in the dough, but the key to the success of this cookie is quite honestly in the chocolate.  I'm not a sucker for any halfway decent chocolate chip that comes along, but let me point out that Bi-Rite does not use chocolate CHIPS per se.  Rather, these would be more accurately referred to as chocolate PLATELETS that are broken into randomly sized chunks.  Sometimes I'll bite into a very expansive platelet that the chef has (perhaps on purpose?) left intact somewhere in the cookie, and this is such a thrilling moment - on par with opening a fortune cookie message that reads, "You will inherit some money or a small piece of land."  A surprisingly complex cookie experience.

My friends and I were on our way to Gelato Naia and saw this huge line and had to see what all the fuss was about. They have interesting flavors, I'm personally not interested in eating ice cream that tastes like flowers, but I tried their Coffee Toffee and Roasted Vanilla and it was amazing. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. They also had ice cream sandwiches, chocolate souffles, chocolate chip, and oatmeal raisin cookies. UPDATE: I was confused where the patisserie was, because I wanted to find the rest of their baked goods. They sell some, but not all, of their baked goods at the creamery. Across the street at the bi-rite market they have tartletts, breads, and cakes, as well as a fine selection of wines... The Malted vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate and Coffee Toffee are so ridiculously good, I think I'm having withdrawal symptoms after just 3 visits.

Jess M is pro Bi-Rite and not so pro Mitchell's. She says the ice cream at Bi-Rite is so much better and in order to give me the best eating tour of SF, she takes me to Bi-Rite and you know what I do? I don't order any ice cream. I go for a melon popsicle. I did however sample the roasted banana and it was freakin good. Not so banana-y but very much a hint of banana. Like chesnuts roasted on an open fire, this banana ice cream was roasted to perfection. But alas, I wanted a follow up to the melon agua fresca I had an La Tacqueria and the melon popsicle at Bi-Rite was the answer. Jessica M got the plum popsicle. It was the most gorgeous shade of purple, it could have been a shade of nail polish. Anyhows, her popsicle ended up tasting like prunes (sorry Jess). My melon popsicle was refreshing and like agua fresca on a stick. Me, Bi-Rite Creamery, Dolores Park, and a bff = a perfect afternoon.

This place is literally heaven in your mouth. Seriously... I know another 5 starts isn't going to do it justice, but I just had to mark this place off on my to do list. I first heard of this place on the food network and was quite intrigued on how the host was ranting and raving about Sam's Sundae (Chocolate ice cream with bergamot olive oil, maldon sea salt and whipped cream) So I tried it not expecting much, but OOOOOH there were so many fireworks going off the creaminess of the ice cream, subtle saltiness of the salt crystals, and the floral notes of the olive oil were just fantastic. I'll also suggest trying the Ricanelas and salted caramel oooh wow... The one thing that I really like is that you can get your ice cream and walk kiddie corner to the park and people watch.

I know people are raving about the Salted Caramel, but for me it was all about the Honey Lavender and Ricanelas (Snickerdoodle) combo! I tasted the Salted Caramel and for a moment I was puzzled to see many people buying scoops of it when I thought it tasted like caramel cooked far too long. Now, now, before the flames come at me that's just my opinion of it alone ... I think that if you paired it with something else it would mellow it out some bit - just sayin'. I got my Honey Lavender and Ricanelas combo which was probably the best decision I've probably ever made in ice cream selecting history! The Honey Lavender was sweet and you could really taste the Lavender in there, it is not subtle. The Ricanelas (Snickerdoodle) was creamy, had bits of Snickerdoodle and had that cinammon-y bite to it and was just wonderful. The workers are great here and for the prices of homemade ice cream, nawwwt bad! P.S. I was still craving for more so I went ahead and got the Mango Popsicle which is $1.95 and it's perfect for those Mango nectar lovers, it was like someone took a mango froze it and sprinkled magic on it to turn it into a popsicle treat! Pretty sweet though.

I've been wanting to try this place for months, so my friends and I decided that today's hot summer weather (FINALLY!) warranted an ice cream trip.  This place was the perfect choice.  We were treated to unique, flavorful ice cream. Here's what we tried: Salted Caramel - My personal favorite!  The best way I can describe it is the top of creme brulee in ice cream form.  It's sooooooo good! Balsamic Strawberry - I couldn't really taste the balsamic, but the strawberry flavor was really nice. Honey Lavender - Of all the honey lavender ice creams I've tried this one has the most lavender.  It was very floral with the slightest hint of honey.  I liked it a lot. Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl - I'm not a big fan of ginger, but my friend got this so I gave it a try.  I was surprised that I liked it.  They really have the right proportions of flavors, and I will get a scoop of this next time. I really wish I got to try all the flavors!  But that just means I need to come back sometime.  A++++ for this place!!

Sorry to burst the 4 or 5 Star bubble but this place just wasn't having it with me. Yeah their ice cream is good, but I definitely would not wait in that long line again for it. Service was okay, ice cream was good, and the servings were way skimpy. For that amount of money, I'd rather go to Mitchell's and feel thoroughly satisfied after. Sorry Bi-Rite, I hope we can still be friends.

I experienced my first bi-rite ice cream this past Monday funday with the boy and Roxie, the poodle.  WOW, since I had never been I got to pick the flavor......I was torn between many, but the snickerdoodle flavor caught my eye and holy ice cream was it delicious.  It had real snickerdoodle chunks in it, was creamy - sort of a mix between gelato and the triple churned ice cream and was a perfect fit in the sugar waffle cone, we should have gotten 3 scoops damnnn it. We then strolled down to the bakery (1 shop down....I know, we're on a roll here)  where they have soft serve and had a vanilla-coffee swirl sample by the extremely nice and happy gal that was working.  I loved her Hello Kitty watch and she laughed with us and told us about all the different treats they had in the window....we walked out with that tasty looking chocolate mini cake.   Rox was not too happy when she found out she couldn't have a piece.

Yum! We stopped here for dessert after brunch at Bar Tartine. Our group ordered the Toasted Coconut, Roasted Banana, Salted Caramel, and Coffee Toffee. We each claimed that ours was the best. I had the Toasted Coconut (surprise, surprise), and it was definitely the best. And it was definitely the best coconut ice cream that I have ever had. Next time I'm up there I want to try honey lavendar, earl grey, olive oil, and/or salted caramel! Don't those all sound amazing? The shop is super cute and the ice cream is to-die-for!

K and I were finally celebrating my bday (it was in January) and I chose to dine at Delfina so I can also 'stop by' Bi-Rite...   I just had to find out what the fuss was all about.   We walked by before dinner and - no surprise - there was an impressive line.  After dinner, even though we were both full, I just *had* to walk by Bi-Rite and check it out, not *really* intending to get anything.  By golly, the line was much shorter!  Maybe only 2-4 people out the door.  So, of course I just *had* to get in line and get something.  So glad we did.   Many flavors caught my *eye* like the salted caramel, roasted banana, chocolate chai...  I ended up getting the salted caramel and the coffee toffee.  Really enjoyed them both.  I was surprised that I enjoyed the salted caramel as much as I did b/c I'm not a fan of *burnt* flavored caramel like that found in Mexican flan (as opposed to the sweeter/milkier version of Filipino leche flan) and *buck's caramel syrup. Can't say that the ice cream here is the best I've ever had, but it surely is up there.  Either way, I can't wait to go back for more!  Yum!

I don't see what the big fuss about Mitchell's is when there are places like this in the city. Of course, I'm still a devote Naia fan, but that's gelato and if I were in the mood for some simple ice cream, I would totally come here instead of Mitchell's, and here's why: 1. They're not as crowded 2. It's right near Dolores Park AND a bunch of cool restaurants 3. You can sit down and hang out here They have a bunch of unique flavors, and the last time I had a sample of the Lavender which was a tie w/the Earl Grey when deciding, but I went with the Earl Grey, which was super yummy...almost tasted like the chai you get when you go to indian restaurants (which is basically Earl Grey w/milk).  Next time though, I'm definitely getting an order of the Lavender cuz I'm still thinking about it!

This was stop one of our multi-sunny-day Bay Area ice cream crawl! Friendly, neighborhoody (if that even can mean anything...), cramped but warm space. The staff here was definitely fun and friendly, especially compared to the more constipated-appearing staff at some of the other shee shee ice cream shops (smile other bitches - it's ice cream!). Music was also fun, space is tight, a line is almost certain it seems. They also had lots of options: Tried (samples are given on real metal spoons) - Blood orange sorbet Honey lavender Mint chip Bought - Earl grey Salted caramel I might have liked the earl gray the most. So creamy and really tea flavored. The salted caramel was nice, but not the best of that flavor that I've had - it's at Hot Chocolate in Chicago (what can I say? I've live a charmed, spoiled, multiple salted caramel ice cream eating life.) - but it's obviously still delicious.

Party in my mouth! I have never tasted a bad flavor here. My absolute favorites are the salted caramel and honey lavender. I just wish their scoops were bigger because I always want more even after a double scoop, but I don't want to look like a fatty so I limit myself to two scoops per visit. But a double here is a single size elsewhere so keep that in mind. Try out their new flavor, creme fraiche!

I finally had the chance to try Bi-Rite Creamery. I mean, I tried it before, but that was at the SF Street Food Festival a couple months ago (had Sam's Sundae at that time and LOVED LOVED LOVED it--chocolate ice cream, olive oil, and a sprinkle of sea salt). This time around, I was so tempted to get Sam's Sundae again, but I opted for a couple scoops. I got creme fraiche and ricanlas (cinnamon with snickerdoodle cookies). The flavors went sooo well together! Craime fraiche was delicious and tart like it should be, and the ricanlas straight up tasted like snickerdoodles (one of my favorite cookies)! I also had a taste of my friend's balsamic strawberry, salted caramel, and coffee coffee, which were all delicious as well. Next time I want to try the ginger, lavendar honey, and roasted banana. Yum yum yum! Luckily I went without my SO, so now I have to take him back there...lucky me! :0)

Best.ice cream.ever.period. Salted caramel, coffee toffee (uses coffee from Ritual!!), ginger, etc etc. Soooo good!! And the servers are soo sweet! They have so much patience - they let me try basically every flavor. Hot or cold, rain or shine, I'm always down for some yummy Bi-Rite!! So here are individual reviews for the flavors I can remember: Salted Caramel: sounds like a weird combo, but it's reallyyy good. Might also be an acquired flavor. Ginger: REALLYY good. But I'm also a huge fan of ginger ice cream. Coffee Toffee: I LOVEEE coffee flavored ice cream, and this is the best I've ever had. Roasted Banana: Gross. Brown Butter Pecan: Really good, but you can almost feel your arteries clogging. Honey Lavender: Not a fan. Kind of tastes as if you're eating soap. Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel: It's okay. I'd much prefer the Salted Caramel. Ricanelas: pretty good. Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces: I can't remember, but I think this might have been good. Sam's Sundae: So I know a lot of people like this sundae, but I think it might be an acquired taste. I definitely was NOT a fan at all. It's chocolate ice cream with olive oil and salt in it. One of the servers created a small sample for me.

I rarely give 5 stars as it requires at least three trips and that the establishment is so good that it gets me to swear like a sailor on shore leave getting his kicks like it's his first time.  The line around corner sucks.  The trek across the bay sucks.  The frequent trips to the potty afterwards because I'm kind of  lactose intolerant sucks.  But what can I say? It's all worth it. That's true love, baby.   The creaminess is not that much more outstanding than, let's say Tucker's in Alameda or Mitchell's in SF, but the flavors are unique and out of this world!  Take the salted caramel for example.  You can really taste the burnt sugar that defines what caramel is while the salt adds just enough complexity to the buttery flavor of the caramel.  And, who would have thought of ROASTED banana ice cream?! Clear taste of bananas with a hint of smokiness from caramelized sugars that come with roasted bananas. Nice staff, super clean space, nearness to Dolores Park (if you want to lick and stroll) just add to what makes this place stand out among the rest.  Where else do you see people huddle in the cold, foggy, SF mist (and sometimes rain) for a scope of ice cream?  It's that good. Take heed, it's that addictive.

Being the only ice cream joint within a stone's throw of the kewlest, warmest park in the city, Bi-Rite couldn't do anything wrong if it tried. But it does try, and it does a darn good job!

I don't get into sweets much, but if you've ever had delicious artisanal ice cream-and I don't mean gelato-you understand why it's one of the rare enticements for my taste buds. I really got excited when I saw the Salted Caramel flavor. It reminded me of the yummy as hell Bertillon ice cream you get in Paris. I hesitated once I saw the price tag: $8 for a pint?!?! wtf...awhh, wt hell, this better be good. No one else is making such good flavors around here. The result: me and 3 other Bertillon fans all really enjoyed the flavor. It should be renamed burnt salty caramel. So freaking tasty! So why, you ask, do I only give it 3 stars? The price you pay is too high for the air-pumped cream. It just doesn't fill you or your freezer as much as the denser stuff I love, but then again, tighter ice cream probably would mean even higher prices. A splurge.

Seriously...Salted Caramel ice cream, OH F YEAH! Sorry if it's boring, but it was really too good. The place was totally cute, not much seating but I think ice cream is best for strolling (too bad the SF nights are not like the East Coast nights...though that's the ONLY way I'd ever compare SF to the East Coast where the East Coast has ANYTHING over SF...) I digress. Go here if you haven't. And if Salted Caramel ice cream sounds remotely interesting to you- GET IT! Oh, you can taste it first too- SWEET, literally!

I remember eating at Delfina's a while back before Bi-Rite Creamery opened up.  We finished dinner and walked by Bi-Rite Market and saw a sign that read homemade ice cream.  Our mouths watered so we decided to go in to get some ice cream.  I think we were looking for scooped ice cream served on cones which we couldn't find.  Looking back I think they probably had pints in the refrigerator.   Disappointment. Years later I drove by that area and saw a new store front, Bi-Rite Creamery!  Woo hoo!  I  immediately stopped (even though I was in a rush to get somewhere) and went in to get some ice cream.  I have never looked back since then.  Bi-Rite has become my favorite place to get ice cream in San Francisco.  I  just love their clean taste and creative flavors which are not over the top like other places but creative enough to make me smile.   Some of my favorites are salted caramel, roasted banana, and double ginger.  The newest flavor on my "like" list is orange cardamom.  A harmonious blend of flavors that aren't too overpowering and works perfectly for me.

Really this was a 3.5 for me....but since I can't give 1/2 a star, I'll round up to be nice. So we came here after dinner on sat since we were in the neighborhood..and it was around 10:15 and the line wrapped around the block. As our group was standing in line, freezing our butts off - I was thinking this better be some bomb-@$$ ice cream! Since I only wanted to try 1 flavor, we decided to to not wait in line and just buy a pint. It's $8 for a pint of this famous Salted Caramel Ice Cream and you don't have to wait in line. Well the ice cream was good but not enough for me to wait 45 mins in line for. Also, for $8 a pint, its pretty pricey! But if I were in the area and the line isn't too long, I'd come here again...but I'm more of a vanilla kind of girl anyway.

Wanted ice cream and we found this place. Saw a phat line but went into the shorter line, i guess just for simple cones. I had a chocolate, vanilla swirl which was very awesome and tasty. As i got more towards the middle i found a hole in the middle of it. The way the cone was swirled on, it left an air hole in the middle of it. I felt a little ripped off lol. My girls ice cream cone was the same way. Is that a signature way of building a soft serve cone? haha. Would I go here again? Maybe if there wasn't anything else around.

One of the few things that has disappointed me about San Francisco is the lack of ice cream joints.  Of course, Mitchell's is incredible, and Bombay will do in a pinch, but it's nice to have another one to add to the list. The cookies and cream was good -- big chunks of Oreos and extra-creamy ice cream.  I'm a big fan of the environmentally-friendly cup and wooden spoons, as well as the real metal spoons for tasting.  Staff was friendly, and although it is small and crowded, the benches outside around the sidewalk trees are really nice. True, $2.95 for a single is more pricey than Mitchell's or Bombay, and you do get less -- but I'm okay with it, because it's one of those times where you pay more to be a little bit healthier.  Cause, who's gonna leave any Mitchell's amazing grasshopper pie in the bottom of the cup?  Not me.  But if you don't get a huge portion to begin with, you aren't gonna eat it.  And if I have to pay a bit more for some help to exercise moderation. . .well. . .that's okay.

Ok Ok, I know I might have a slight, no major addiction to ice cream and frozen yogurt, but at least I am happy to admit it! I was very excited to try this place after hearing great things about it and I am always looking for new sweet spots. I must admit there was a pretty long line and my friend said, "Do you really want to wait in this line?...We can just skip it." to which I replied, "No, we can't skip it. I hear it goes fast, it's worth the wait and I MUST HAVE ICE CREAM." Yummmmmy, so worth the wait and I wish I had gotten a bigger size because when I finished, I sadly looked down at my cup wishing there was just one more bite. And I was getting a cup of coffee this morning right across the street at The Dolores Park Cafe at 7 a.m. (on a Sunday, don't ask) and I wished they were open, I would have happily had their ice cream for breakfast.

Bi-Rite creams a good ice... There are several features upon which I typically judge ice cream.  Texture is obviously quite important, but Bi-Rite's best attribute is in the taste department.   Typically I am somewhat of a traditionalist when it comes to new flavors (Peppermintstick on a summer day is pretty hard to beat), and this usually stems from the fact that many creamers who venture into new flavors just dont nail it.  These guys have some of the best true flavor in creamed ice that I have ever come across.  My typical benchmark for flavor quality gravitates around the standards (Coffee being paramount, as few nail this one, as well as Strawberry and Vanilla).  These guys kill it with their coffee with toffee in it, nice work. They obviously get some credit for their flavors of novelty, as well, and the basics (or iterations of basics, like the Strawberry with Balsamic, essentially a Strawberry with a bunch of "zing" to it) are quite tasty. Lack of novelty-traditional flavors is OK in their realm, as all flavors they make are truly their own. Amazing flavor, definitely solid texture, and  a great shop.

if i can creatively express the goodness of bi-rite creamery with books I've read... For example, Baskin Robbins is like "where the wild things are" by Maurice Sendak- simple, full of colors, craziness, nostalgically childish. where as Bi-Rite Creamery is like "the prophet" by Kahlil Gibran - wanting, philosophical, insightful, full of perspective. They uniquely handcraft ice-cream flavors and you can mix and match the flavors just the way you like it, in two scoops or more. So be creative and go to Bi-Rite Creamery, and get some perspective!

I'm so down with this place. Maybe even too down. I don't think I could pass this creamery and not get their ice cream even if I tried. They're famous for their salted caramel. There is an excellent reason for this. It's heavenly. And I don't even like caramel! The downside: The lines can be dauntingly long. The upside: The soft-serve counter 10 feet away NEVER has a line and is really good too. Sunday is chocolate/salted caramel twist. DO IT.

This place is by far the best ice cream you can get.  It seems like every time my friends and I eat in San Francisco, we always end up here at Bi-Rite for dessert. First time i came here, my taste buds was kind of off. I believe i had a hangover or something but i didn't like it. Second time i came here, i got the salty caramel and the malted vanilla with peanut brittles all stacked inside of a cone. Let me explain that moment. The salty caramel had a crazy kick to it in a good way, it's like Chuck Norris punched your tongue. The malted vanilla with peanut brittles helped calm the caramel down. Mix those 2 flavors together and you got a party in your mouth. You have to get both taste mixed together and you will understand what i went through. It was delicious. 5 stars for a great ice cream shop

Where could this craving.. this urge.. this madness be remedied??? *Gasp!* The Ninja began to flashback to an episode of "The Best Thing I Ever Ate: Sugar Rush". Aida had spoke of this creamery called "Bi-Rite". With no time to waste the Ninja-mobile sped off in a thunderous chirp! After several loops around the block the Ninja located a parking spot and was ready for battle. A smile grew ear to ear once the Ninja's eyes gazed upon the creamery. .::Overall::. Salted Caramel - Ah-Mezzing!! - Salty & Sweet cannot go wrong here Toasted Coconut - Very Nice - Like biting into a super creamy macaroon Pumpkin - Excellent - the Ninj' kept looking for pie crust bc it was just like eating pumpkin pie Coffee Toffee- Excellent - So good the Ninj' has decided to have a scoop of this in the morning instead of a cup of joe Bonus - the staff is fantastically friendly ^_^ .::Recommendations??!!::.

Single Scoop of Malted Vanilla and Ricanelas.  Best ice cream I've ever tasted.  So creamy and smooth, the flavors were strong and sweet.   When I'm back, I'll try to be more adventurous and get something like the olive oil, which I tried and was surprisingly delicious.

I came here after dinner last nite.. and i might say the ice cream here is fantastic. I had to minus one star b/c I really wanted to try the honey lavender, but they were out of it!! They could at least have one of the workers erase that flavor, or put SOLD OUT for today or somethin'. Other than that, I plan on going there in hopes of trying that flavor. I tried the salted caramel. Very tasty indeed

I came here on a Monday night, hoping there won't be a crazy long line like there is on the weekends. And I was in luck, there were only about 6 people ahead of us. The flavors here are very creative and unique, not your typical ice cream shop. The best part is that they continue to create new ingredients, which keeps it interesting. I had the roasted banana and brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl. It was good, but too sweet. Creamy, but nothing out of the ordinary. Flavors were on key though. I would come back if I was around the area and if the line doesn't extend around the block. Not my favorite, but still pretty good.

I love ice cream.  On a stick, in a bowl, from the carton, on a cone, doesn't matter.  I love ice cream.  Bi-Rite is awesome. This place is down the street from Tartine Bakery (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…). I test tried a few flavors and decided on Earl Grey.  I don't drink earl grey tea nor do I like it much but for some reason, I can have a gallon of that ice cream.  This is on the list of places I am revisiting and taking my sister to try.

It's concluded. I'm a 1000+ review whore. I have week long affairs in my head about these places until i try it. I do what P Diddy does; I mind f**k these food havens before, during and long after my first bite. As you've read, Bi-Rite is the right bite for that perfect after dinner or pre-dinner spoiler. Unlike my sweet talk, everything, that everyone says, about the Salted Caramel and Honey Lavender is true.  The Salted Caramel makes you melt before the ice cream and the Honey Lavender massages your buds and instantaneously relaxes any angst or uncertanties you've had about their flavors - If only it could kick your feet up for you and do your laundry(but i guess that's what boyfriends are for).  Two very different flavors that dance so gracefully on your tongue. We also bought a scoop of the Ricanelas (cinnamon and snickerdoodle), coffee toffee and had a chance to sample the earl grey, roasted banana and cookies and cream. They all left me sad that i didn't have a larger stomach or higher tolerance for sweets. I don't care if it's dirty and a little scary....The Mission is slowly becoming my  little, foodie, promised land of hope.

Bi-rite creamery, Why must your line be so long? Sometimes I hate that I crave this place because there's always a long line. But nonetheless, I choose to stand in line with the hipsters of dolores park and wait in the cold san francisco fog/overcast for bi-rite's ICE CREAM. I'm not for all the extreme flavors my palette is not to sophisticated yet so my favorites are banana, salted caramel, and malted vanilla with peanut brittle. YUMS!   i scream you scream we all WAIT for ice cream! note: its a small creamery so i wouldn't plan on eating in. There benches outside though.

Yum, yum and yum!  The small creamery offers a small but unique and gourmet flavours like salted caramel, lavender and creme fraiche. The texture was soft but rich and creamy. There is a small seating area inside the creamery but there are also benches outside the store.  We sat outside under the cover of the store to savour our delightful treats. If it weren't for the wet weather, we would haver gone across the street to Delores Park to enjoy the view and skyline of the city.

Visitor's Perspective: With NYC currently under the onslaught of frozen yogurt chains, I mam just happy to get away from it and get back to basics - ice cream. A first time San Francisco visit would not be complete without visiting a cool dessert spot, especially one with 3,000-plus Yelp reviews.   While the salted caramel seems to be an overwhelming favorite, the pumpkin sundae was just unbelievable. It totally hit the spot after a mediocre sushi dinner. Unfortunately, I can only surmise that this is a seasonal item so I would say that I visited at the most opportune moment. A special shout out to the amazingly friendly gentleman behind the counter who basically responded "Thanks for coming and God Bless You" simply because I requested an extra spoon. God Bless? You San Franciscans are just wonderful.

This review is a tad bit old, seeing as it was a part of the 'Mission Adventure' I ended up going on with Amy J. However I adored this place. The seating was cute and cozy, the service was quick and friendly and my lavender honey scoop was tasty and delicious. The only negative I could see is if it were really busy (like I've heard it gets) I would have probably knocked off a star for the lack of seating and the crowd.

I've heard a whole lot about this place, so I finally got a chance to try this out.  The line was about 5-10 minutes on a Saturday night, not too bad.  Though I was growing more hesitant with the winds picking up in the evening time. That said, I grabbed a single order of the salted caramel, which I hear is a favorite.  My tastebuds must have been overloaded though, as I was pretty surprised by how salty it was, heh.  Perhaps I should've grabbed a second flavor to compensate for how powerful the salted caramel was. All in all, I enjoyed coming here, looking forward to trying ice cream when I'm not in the mood to experiment with flavors (like Humphry Slocomb)

I'm a man of simple tastes, vanilla ice cream is often a standard of mine with "cookie dough" being relatively fancy for me. But, when I stopped in at Bi-Rite Creamery and saw their more exotic offerings, I had to at least sample some of them. The cinnamon was actually quite tasty and left an impression on me, I still sometimes think about the flavor and texture. I wound up getting cookie dough, though :)

I'm sure lots of other reviews go way into depth about the Bi-Rite Creamery, so this is all I'll say: 1. I always thought it was way far away from anything I knew, and I was wrong. 2. The honey lavender ice cream and I are engaged and are planning on having many, many babies.

This is the best ice cream in the city, no contest. Last night I discovered my new favorite flavor, too.. malt with peanut butter. I got the coffee sunday with half of that flavor and actually liked it better than the coffee ice cream (normally my favorite). The sunday was incredible... lots of nuts, toffee, chocolate sauce and whipped cream on top. It was $6.50, but worth every penny. I stashed half in my freezer because it was so huge, and may have the other half for a sinful breakfast this week. Those who are looking for a cheap scoop of "normal flavored" ice cream at regular prices and don't recognize gourmet ingredients or superior quality, go elsewhere to avoid the line (and save me time!), but those who appreciate outstanding food, its worth the hassle!

Oh why, oh why....most of the foods I fall in love with it is in SF? Oh why?! Bi-Rite is just not any kind of ice cream/dessert shop, it a decadent mixture of different flavors that makes one hell of a scoop or even more. The flavors they have may make your mind debating if you should try it but once you have, your taste buds will be begging for more. At this first visit to Bi-Rite, I chose a kids scoop of chocolate coconut ice cream. It was smooth, creamy with specs of coconut and a good taste of chocolate. I new I should have opted for a single scoop which includes 2 flavors because while eating mine, I tasted some other flavors hubby and my sister chose and wish I have gotten the other flavors. From their scoops, I was able to taste roasted bananas, balsamic strawberry and snicker doodle ice cream. WOW....the freshness of the ingredients hits your mouth which instantly makes you say "HMMMM" and grabbing some more. I don't know if I have a FAVORITE but I do have to say, the next time I come back, I will get a single scoop with Balsamic strawberry and snicker doodle. When you first arrive at Bi-Rite, you may need to stand in line but don't let it bum you down. The line goes by quick and you won't remember standing in line once you finish your ice cream.

Friday night at Bi-Rite. I read up on this place. On a list of other places to try, Bi-Rite was our initial stop. I think I got my hopes up though. Came here to try one thing and one thing only: Salted Caramel. But sad to say, it was a bust. The Salted Caramel ice cream didn't cut it for me. Standing in line wasn't worth it. I don't know why they hype it up but the sweet and salty wasn't right for this contraption. Flavor was extremely overwhelming. A little too rich, in fact. No cone here. My sis also sampled the Chocolate Chip. That was pretty good. I likes me my chocolate chips. Kinda made me rethink my decision about ordering Salted Caramel on its own. For a single scoop, you get to choose between 1-2 flavors. Maybe I wasn't bold enough to try the other flavors and was too hung up on trying only one. I'm all for their environmental friendliness and I hear it's a great place for awesome ice cream. But I still haven't seen the light yet. Maybe next time.

Well this is review 2609 for Bi Rite so I'll just keep it brief. Walked by yesterday and there was NO LINE.  So I stopped in and got three scoops - Salted Caramel, Chocolate and Brown Butter Pecan. Salted Caramel was a revelation.  I've seriously not had anything like that.  It was INSANELY delicious and honestly worth the hype. The other two flavors were ok but it's all about the Salted Caramel.  Oh yes.

I liked the texture of the ice cream and how unique it tasted. I liked the vibe from the shop, too. Still, I regret not sampling some other stuff - or at least sampling the salted caramel before we ordered it - because I wasn't crazy about that flavor. It wasn't bad, definitely different, but I wouldn't care for it. I guess I would just advise not to blindly run straight into the salted caramel.

Finally!  I had been trying to make it here since opening - latest attempt having been thwarted by Bi-Rite's abnormally early closing time (10pm on a weekend?  Come on!).  So this past Friday, I committed to foregoing dessert at Delfina (very tough move) for some ridiculously-anticipated ice cream.  Made from scratch with Straus dairy products, food snob-friendly flavors... I knew this would be my kind of place.   And I was not let down.  This is seriously good stuff.  Because I am a caramel obsessive, that's naturally what I got.  Salted caramel + brown butter pecan (the latter being a bit too subtle to truly shine in the intensely caramelly salty face of the former) + whipped cream + marcona almonds + homemade fudge sauce = Delfina panna cotta, I don't miss you in the least.  Though next time, it's going to be all about the Toffee Coffee.  I love coffee ice cream.  Will I love it more than caramel?  TBD, my friend, TBD...

I'm not a sweets person or a dessert person or really anyone who even regularly eats sugar, mostly because (1) I have a love affair with salt, and couldn't imagine cheating on it with silly sugar; and more importantly, (2) it's not on the diet plan to lose these "last" 5 lbs. Nevertheless, I paid the toll. Yep. Got on the hedonism hwy and oh man, was it worth it! I had no clue heaven was on terra firma, much less in the Mission, but OMG all I can say is Almond Joy sundae... emphasis on JOY. Never mind it's a $6.50 sundae, b/c quite frankly, if they charged $20 I'd get it (please don't do that though, Bi-Rite). You MUST try it & throw yourself a gastronomic party. Also, service here is icing on the cake, err, I mean whipped cream on the scoops - the 2 gals that work the counter here are both awesome! Friendly, knowledgeable, quick & enthusiastic despite the deplorably long line of drooling customers.

OMFG.   Delicious.  Creative flavors.  I settled on a small with half honey lavender/half salted carmel.  The honey lavender was sweet, but not overly sweet, and not overly floral.  It went perfectly with the salted carmel, which had a slightly burnt sugar taste (in a good way) which was well balanced by the sweet and floral of the honey lavender.   I appreciated the large sample tastes that they offered up.  The guy that was helping me was just giving me tastes of interesting flavors, which was much appreciated!  All the people working there seemed really nice and helpful. My husband had the chococalte coconut, which was vegan yet surprisingly still creamy!

Such a cute lil' place.  The flavors are innovative and so tasty!!!  Local, organic, and sustainable products used when creating their treats.  I've been back here twice and have always gotten really lucky with parking (jinx).   First time was the 2nd day they had opened.  I had the Brownie Sundae which consisted of housemade decadent brownies with salted caramel & cookies and cream ice cream, chocolate and burnt caramel sauce, whipped Straus cream, and candied pecans.  This was all devoured between me and my bro with bio-degradable spoons! 2nd visit was a nice scoop of salted caramel ice cream on an organic sugar cone-yummmmy! Because the flavors are innovative-ask for lots of tastes.  They are nice about it :)  Tastes come on silverware spoons, ergo cutting back on waste-another mindful, green move. Note: on both visits I've seen, but have yet to order, the homemade hot chocolate.  There's a machine brewing near the register-TEMPTATION.  Last visit I noticed it was labeled EXTRA DARK CHOCOLATE brewing-OMG!!!  Also, don't even look into the take-home freezer.... *Love the cute benches they built around the palm trees out front*

Oh my goodness. Wow. I love ice cream, I used to be the President of the Ice Cream Appreciation Society, I should know these things. Anyhoo. Did I say wow? This place is mouth-watering, I'm licking my chops right now. The ice cream here is SO GOOD, good enough that I use the word good against the advice of all my English teachers. The texture is spot on, creamy, smooth, delicious, and none of that weird fatty aftertaste you can get at some "homemade" ice cream style places or from your own ice cream maker. I had a sundae, the whipped cream was really whipped on the premises, it looked drab because it didn't come out of a fancy spout but from a spatula, the almonds were half pieces so they were crunchy and the hot fudge was decadent. I don't even like chocolate that much, and I still loved the rich gooeyness of the hot fudge. Now on to the ice cream. I couldn't decide what to get so we split a sundae, salted caramel and cookies and cream. I kind of wanted the banana ice cream but I thought I'd be a good sport and let my friend choose the other half. They were both FANTASTIC, wow, I am salivating as I sit here. Flavorful and rich, it's the way I like my ice cream and chunky full of oreos for the cookies n' cream. I'll be sure to stop next time I'm in the Bay. It was the highlight of my day.

I live a block from Bi Rite, a good and bad thing.  After many visits and much deliberation, I have discovered the perfect scoop.  Honey Lavendar with hot fudge.  Sharing this juicy tidbit is possibly the greatest service I could provide to the yelp community.  I hope you make good use of it. Plus, this place is open later than most restaurants in SF (another good and bad thing).  Finally, somewhere that understands that the city shouldn't shut down at 9pm on week nights.

Bi-Rite is my 2nd destination after Ike's. It really goes hand in hand. LOVE LOVE LOVE the Salty Caramel. Thanks so much for my fellow Yelper's recommendation ! The honey lavender? It was too weird for my taste. You know it's like the feeling  like eating cold  creamy lavender scented soap from the fridge . Ugh.     Bad news is I had to finish the whole pint. Good news is my taste buds were so numb from the coldness that it didn't mind at all.      Back to the Salty caramel. Get a scoop and get a pint to go. You will crave for it the same night. TRUST ME.    I can't wait to see what Bi-rite has to offer next time I return. If  only Salty Caramel wasn't so AMAZINGLY GOOD, it would definitely give other flavors a chance.    Beware of the lines.l came here on a cold, rainy Thurs night. Thinking everyone would be in bed curled up in a blanket. And  there it was......A LONG line. So I had to run in to get the pints and enjoy it at home.

Ok, I will admit it. I was a little intimidated by the Sam's Sundae concept. Chocolate ice cream, bergemot olive oil, sea salt, and whipped cream. For a midwestern boy who was raised on the sweet pleasure of vanilla custard turtle sundaes, this is a major departure from the norm. So glad I took the plunge. The olive oil is insanely fruity, and with the salt it makes for this immense amount of depth that your tongue just doesn't expect off the bat. Incredible genius went into this creation. I will be back for more someday.

Organic? I'm SO there. Never would have thought that these quirky flavors would taste so amazing together. I got the salted caramel & shoot, my brain just farted and I'm forgetting my other flavor. But it's okay. Because the salted caramel, the honey lavender, strawberry balsamic and white chocolate blackberry swirl are enough to make up for that flavor I forgot. Must try!

Came here on a Sunday afternoon, there was a line of course, but it moved pretty quickly. I got a single, with salted caramel & malted vanilla (vanilla w/ peanut brittle). BF got salted caramel & the one w/ the snickerdoodles in it. To me the salted caramel was a bit much.. too salty, not enough sweet. The malted vanilla was good. The ice cream consistancy was very nice, very smooth. I also tasted my friend's Balsamic Strawberry, yum, and honey lavender (eh, I felt like I was eating perfume). Super nice people and nice environment.

ARE YOU FRICKING KIDDING ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I cried while I took in all sugary wonderfulness of this place! I had a sunday as big as my head and tried the salted caramel ice cream ( once again are you kidding me ) and mint chip. This is some of the best ice cream I have ever had in my life. I would consider myself an ice cream snob and a bit of an aficionado and they have become the top shelf with me. DISCLAIMER: There is no true way to verify that I am the aficionado that I say I am. I will tell you this! I eat ice cream...therefor i am.

As a person who spent a good part of high school working in an ice cream shop, I have to say Bi-Rite Creamery is the cream of the crop. This whole week has been ice cream weather (and earthquake weather but we won't talk about that) and after a nice visit to Dolores Park, Bi-Rite is the perfect topping. Extra star for using all natural ingredients.

My friend took a taste of her ice cream, looked at me and said: "I really sometimes hate it when a place lives up to all of the hype."  Yes, this is that place.   The flavors are unique and delicious.  My favorites?  The orange cardamon,  salted caramel; balsamic strawberry, and the cinnamon.  (The list may only be limited because I haven't tried all of the flavors.) Subtracting a star as the service is odd.  The guy helping me walked off in the middle of my order, then returned with no explanation, then served me the wrong flavor of ice cream.  (Wanted Coconut, but got banana. Still tasty, but wrong fruit!).  Also, prices are a little high.  I could buy a whole pint of (admittedly inferior ice cream) for the price of a scoop.  It's still worth it though...

You'll be hard stuck to find anyone in dolores park who hasn't at one time or another tried bi-rite creamery (and reviewed it on yelp ) to either maintain their hipster air or superiority, or simply because it's the closet ice cream to the park. because for some reason, elite status is achieved by, "Oh yes, I waited 30 minutes in line for the best ice cream in the city" I'd been a few times years ago (before there were lines. okay it may have been the dead of winter, no hipster points there) and wasn't wholeheartdly impressed. yes, it was ice cream, yes it tasted okay, but it was nothing to write home about. But then I went back last night, and oh man, it was a different story all together. Now I'm not one of those people who get excited over exotic ie cream flavors, and really I mostly just like chocolate. Bi Rite's chocolate is not bad, but I've had better (aka strauss) . But last night I got two scoops, one chocolate and one roasted banana, and oh man, it was a mouthgasm to be sure. So good that I'll probably go back again tonight on my way home (It's probably a bad thing that this place is on my commute path) So for those of you who have yet to try the Birite creamery, suck it up, stand in line and taste a little bit of deliciousness. On a side note, their ice cream is totally affordable, the staff friendly, and the inside spotless.

I basically second everyone's opinions and suggestions here (did the salted caramel, toasted banana, and coffee toffee).  Everything was delicious as expected (I'm a harsh critic on ice cream, so I RARELY give out the full 5 for ice cream establishments unless they really REALLY blow my mind... or if Jake Gyllenhaal's behind the counter). However, I do have to mention that the best part of the visit was when the lady at the register rang me up: Lady: What'd you order? Me: Uh....two sundaes. *slightly embarassed and feeling like a fatty* (Note that I'm by myself as my friends didn't feel like waiting in the line and decided to lay out at Dolores Park on one of those rare sunny days in SF). Lady: Oh... don't worry, no explanation needed. Thumbs up for sure for their customer service, and understanding.

Forget about ordering vegan ice cream from Herbivore after dinner! Go to Bi-rite Creamery! Bi-rite has like 2 vegan flavors but their chocolate coconut is incredible!! And also way cheaper than paying $4.25 for ice cream at Herbivore (I do think they're reasonably priced on everything except most of their dessert items). The people working there are all pretty chill and yeah there's usually a huge wait but it's totally worth it. I like to get my ice cream here and then head to Dolores Park to enjoy.

Would I stand in line outside on a cold & rainy San Francisco night to eat this ice cream?  Yes, without hesitation. The honey lavender is so good that my best friend's cousin once smuggled two pints onto an airplane to bring some back home to her family. Salted caramel is equally delicious, but extremely sugary, which is of course a-okay so long as you are mentally prepared.

#2123 reviews. Holy sh*t! Everything I say will probably be a repeat of everything everyone else has said about Bi-Rite Ice Cream. Even this statement was probably said at least 10 times. Oh well. Even though there is 0.00000001% chance that someone might even read this review, I still would love to share with you my feelings about this wonderful place.   If Bi-Rite Ice Cream and I had a song, it would be "Me & Mrs. Jones" I grew up eating Mitchell's Ice Cream and loyal to the creaminess and the tasty textures of the Ube and Lanka flavor. Nobody would be able to tell me otherwise. Then in 2007, Bi-Rite came along with its Salted Caramel and Coffee Toffee and swept me off my feet. I was going back and forth, forth and back, trying to stay loyal to my Mitchell's. Every once and awhile I would secretly drop in to Bi-Rite and have a scoop, but would always run back in to Mitchell's arms. I thought of Bi-Rite every now and then...of our secret ice cream love affair, but stopped going all together. Tried a few different ones...Swensen's, Humphrey's, but I didn't feel the same way about them as I did with Bi-Rite. Then recently, I joined the 7x7 Big Eats and there it was...#35 Bi-Rite's salted caramel. And the rest is... When are you going to start your love-affair with Bi-Rite?

Bi-Rite's ice cream is delicious but I would also recommend their popsicles, especially on a hot summer day. I have tried a few of their popsicles, but mango-strawberry is still the best. They seem to change the popsicle flavors by season. The popsicle tasted like a frozen sweet mango stuffed with strawberries. In terms of ice cream, I love their balsamic strawberry. The only flavor I have tried and not like was honey lavender so much because of the lavender taste. But if you like lavender, like lavender tea, you will like it. They are known for their salted caramel ice cream. It is amazing and something everyone should try at Bi-Rite, however, I found it very hard to finish my small serving. It became too sweet towards the end. If you go often, buy 10 items, get a scoop free!

I have been eyeing this place for the last year, just waiting for an excuse to eat their raved about ice cream! Finally! The Boyfriend was in town and in SF, so I had the perfect excuse to force him to eat ice cream with me even though it was cold and rainy. Nothin' ice cream can't solve :) We went and the lady behind the counter offered us generous amounts of samples and offered up her fav, the snickerdoodle ice cream. The only downside is it's a bit expensive (3.50 for a small) but mmmm it was a frickin' party in my mouth and my taste buds and stomach thanked me for it later.

I finally got to visit the actual Bi-Rite Creamery in SF and boy, was I a happy camper. **Note: parking was a pain. Expect to circle around 18th Street for at least 20 minutes. Street parking in SF is terrible. I don't have any advice for this other than to pray that you get lucky and find a parking spot nearby. ATMOSPHERE It reminded me a lot of Ici back in Berkeley, except not as "cute" and "girly." Like at Ici, you can sample the flavors with actual silver spoons! Classy at its best. There were also jars of fudge/syrup and baked goods lined along the walls, which only served to tempt me to buy bags of chocolate chip cookies or salted caramel syrup. Mmm. The place is very small. In fact, there's more room near the cashier compared to the seating area, which is a narrow room with immovable wooden tables and tiny wooden stools. FOOD The flavors change daily and you can call in to ask for the daily selection. However, based off other Yelpers, I decided to go with the salted caramel and the honey lavender and HOT DAMN were they tasty. I highly recommend both flavors. However, both flavors do get a little sweet after a while, so I recommend getting a single and split the single into half honey lavender and half salted caramel-- that way, you don't get sugar overload and you can still leave extremely satisfied. Overall, one of the best ice cream parlors I've been to. It's just a shame they didn't have the balsalmic strawberry ice cream sandwich I tried at the SF Food Festival...

What can I say about Bi-Rite? I think my feelings are best summed up by the following excerpts from an email exchange I had today: From: Leilani H. To: XXX Subject: Re: Knees* Date: Mon, November 22, 2010 "...In other news I had an ice cream last night that seriously changed my life, true story. Ever heard of Bi-Rite Creamery? Its near Dolores Park and there is always a long line out the door, even on cold days. I always thought these people were insane, I mean it's ICE CREAM for chrissake. That is, until I had a bite of my roommate's pint of snickerdoodle ice cream. I get it now. They put crack in their ice cream, in the form of sugary cinnamon-y explosions of goodness within each frosty bite. Its so f'ing good I'm waxing lyrical in this very email about it. I think this may be the beginning of a very unhealthy obsession, and of course my knee is injured so I can't even run off the pints I will consume all in one sitting - because that scenario is most definitely imminent in my future. Fuck you, knee**." "...No, for real. I was BLOWN AWAY. I can only speak for the snickerdoodle flavor. Go forth and try and cry tears of joy." *The recipient of aforementioned email had inqured about my newly acquired runner's knee which is directly related to **

Last stop on our badunkaversary. We came here because it is famous on Yelp. Let's just start off saying that we've had some pretty good ice-cream in our time (i.e. Ici's, Tara's, etc.). The decorations are really nice, and it's a lot more festive than any other ice-cream place that we've been to. The line wasn't too long, and it moved quickly. We stood in line, stomachs bulging, looking at the menu. We were a little bit hesitant because we were scared to go beyond the tipping point of fullness, but we just had to try it. We got a double-scoop with: - Brown sugar with ginger caramel: overall good flavours, but a bit too sweet. The real ginger they used was pretty good, but the sugar overpowered the quality of the ingredients. - Ricanelas (cinnamon & snicker-doodle): I actually just don't think cinnamon ice-cream sounds appealing. Celia why did you choose that one? I don't know. That was a bad decision :(     /stream-of-consciousness The scoops are HUGE though-- it's a pretty good price for quality ice-cream. When we paid, the cashier asked whether we were eating here or to go, but he'd already handed me a to go cup, so I wondered what the difference was. Then he informed me of the eat-in tax, which made me indignant, but Celia said it made sense because they were "internalizing an externality." We would come here again, but only if we're in the neighbourhood. Otherwise, we would rather stop by Ici's or Tara's in Berkeley.

The best way to avoid those ridiculously long lines (although we still had to wait about 5ish minutes) is to visit at 9:30pm on a Tuesday night when it's 48 degrees outside. The nice thing (but sometimes not as fun thing) about Bi-Rite is their safely tasty flavors. Can't go wrong by the general masses for the most part. Honey lavender, always a hit. Earl Grey, ever so fragrant. Chocolate is bombastic. Etc, etc. The quality of ice cream is also very good, dense and rich. However, it doesn't give me that tingle I get in my panties when something's just outta control.

Beware: LINE! Another stop to cleanse the palette on my San Francisco road trip, we came here after Ike's Place, which was featured on Man v Food. It is only a few blocks away, making it a perfect spot to go to and it is right across the street from a high school and park. The time we went there was a line just around the corner, which probably took about a half hour. It moves quicker than I thought, so don't be too intimidated. As for flavors, they are known for the salty caramel, which I tried and liked a lot, but I wanted the banana split, and it was a little to pungent for something like that.  So I ended up getting a banana split with vanilla ice cream and a cinnamon snickerdoodle ice cream, which had some weird name, but either way, you'll know it when you see it.  It was a great banana split, you got the fudge, the nuts, the ice cream, the whipped cream.  All the elements of awesomeness.  Was it the best one I've ever had...no, but it was still worthy of me making a return trip. If you're in SF, I would definitely make a stop here to cleanse the palette from all the other food places to try in and around the city.

THIS IS SOME CRAZY ICE CREAM!! I tried the honey lavender, the salty caramel, and the roasted banana. The roasted banana was so strong, it was so so flavorful. Not in a bad way, mind you, but if you aren't a banana fan this isn't the ice cream for you. The salty caramel tastes exactly like you would expect it to, as long as you expect it to taste delicious. caramel ice cream with salt in it-standard. Lastly, the honey lavender was FANTASTIC! My favorite flavor, it was the most subtle of the 3 and was such an unexpected combination of tastes. By the way, parking is terrible and I'm assuming there's always a line because I waited a while on a day it was raining. So, prepare your nerves because driving around (and around and around) that block while eccentric ice cream flavors await you is extremely annoying.

Oh good mother of god. I don't usually eat ice cream, but holy friggin cow this place is legit. Bi-Rite fires on all cylinders. It's a small creamery that seats only about 10 people, but damn I can definitely see what the hype is about. I ordered the honey lavender and the earl grey. Oh my god, the honey lavender. Probably the best ice cream I've had in recent memory. Not to knock on that earl grey, but damn the honey lavender takes the cake. Super reasonable prices, $3.25 for 2 scoops in a small cup. Not a crazy line, and great service and recommendations from a nice staff. Located right near Dolores park, you can grab your legit ice cream and have a hipster hangout at the park afterwards.

I am not normally one for sweets, and need to be in the mood for ice cream, but this place was good.  Very fresh flavors.  I came on a Sunday afternoon and the line wrapped around the building.  When it was our turn to order, we were overwhelmed with all of the things we wanted to try.  Being as busy as it was, they still let us sample several of the ice creams.  They even recommended a few more to try and gave us samples of those as well.  The salted caramel, balsamic strawberry, the one with the snickerdoodles and the lavender honey were among my favorites.  I will definitely venture back. Thanks Bi-rite for the friendly service and good ice cream!  Oh and I forgot to mention the homemade graham cracker toppings and whip cream.

I could get more and better flavors at the local rite-aide, where they sell the old fashion thrifty ice cream versus this lame joint. Also, the staff sucks.  They are very rude and the sour flame queen behind the counter should really take a good look in the mirror... (let's see if I can express this correctly)... "You are just serving ice cream, s-w-e-e-t-i-e"... treat your customers with respect. Mitchell's is still the best.  This place can't even compare.  For those that feel this is a place people have not found...maybe, they did, and realized the same. What a waste.   I need Mitchell's to remove the bad taste this place left in my mouth.

I've only gone to Bi-Rite Creamery during off times, and on my second most recent visit, there was this one surly counter-person who was clearly from New York (and clearly so shamelessly rude that he figured he'd move to the West coast because he's run out of people to alienate.) Anyway, that punk appears to be gone and thank goodness! On my most recent trip my boyfriend and I were showing some friends around the neighborhood. This time we waited in the long line I always try to avoid. Well, we waited less than 10 minutes -- far less painful than I expected. There was friendly, happy and helpful staff behind the counter, and this was during a sunny day which is incredibly busy for them. And the best part of the recent visit: I learned that you can get two flavors in your single scoop serving. That's information that will force me to kiss my waistline goodbye for good, but whatever! That's the price you pay for the five minute orgasm of eating their ice cream.

Bi-Rite's ice cream is very good (I dig the Honey Lavender and Balsamic Strawberry), but Amy's Ice Cream in SoCo in Austin, TX, is so much better: http://bit.ly/9sBqrq As for the Salted Caramel everyone raves about?

So, Bi-Rite is definitely one of the most hyped ice cream spots in the city.. BUT, I have no qualms in saying that the hype is absolutely well deserved. Straight up, this is one of the few foods in the world that I can eat and then immediately be in a good mood.. Their ice cream legitimately makes me happy. I guess I'm no ice cream expert, but I have had my fair share of ice cream cones beyond Dreyers from the Safeway freezer aisle.. And, Bi-Rite's unique flavor selection, creamy and flavorful ice creams, and staff (usually) are truly bomb. If anyone visited me here in SF, this would be a destination for sureskees. What I recommend: EARL GREY TEA (do it), Honey Lavender (damnnn), Salted Caramel (a little hyped, but pretty good), Coffee Toffee. Notes: Typically a long line, even at night/when it's cold. Suck it up and wait. Don't park in front from 4pm-6pm M-F because you'll get ticketed... Beeeeen happened to me.. Conclusion: Must go to destination in SF. Even if you end up hating it (which you won't, unless you are an absolute freak), you should say that you tried Bi-Rite Ice Cream.

Great tasting and quality ice cream without breaking your wallet even in one of the most expensive cities in the world. I usually dont like ice cream but the salted caramel was pretty good. Even at 10pm at night theres still a line down the block.  if you are in the city, give it a try. Make sure to get some napkins if you get the salted caramel cone, the salt makes it melt faster than most ice cream.

I am usually not a big fan of ice cream, but this place was so talked about that I had to try it out and I certainly was not disappointed. I liked this place so much that I went there twice in one weekend while visiting San Francisco. It was super hot the first day I went and the line was around the block. This is what I get for coming here the first time at around 3pm; everyone and their mother had the same idea of staying cool with some ice cream. I had to wait almost 30 minutes to get my ice cream, and it was definitely worth it. Salted caramel - excellent toasted sugar flavor. The on the palate taste was smooth and creamy, the after taste was great with lingerings of caramel. Two Thumbs up! Honey lavender - was nice and delicate, but I didn't care for the lavender taste so much. The 2nd time I visited this place was the day after in the morning right after breakfast. Haha, yeah I am crazy. In my defense, I was literally down street  and I found street parking, so as to not waste it. I walked over to Bi-Rite again, the weather was warming up, really...hehe. Malted vanilla - taste like a vanilla malt shake. It has crushed peanuts and bits of malt in it which makes it even better. I personally would like more peanuts, but still very good. I am torn between salted caramel or malted vanilla. I think I will get them both next time. Do yourself a favor and visit Bi-Rite, especially on a hot summer day. Enjoy!

Used to love this place until that one fateful day in February... Was down to my second-to-last lick of yummy Salted Caramel ice cream on a sugar cone when I see something dark and wiry right at the surface of my last bite. It's a pube. Seriously. Not believing my own eyes, my friend and I picked it out and put it on a napkin to get a better look. No other part of the human body's hair looks like that (and you know it). It was unmistakably a pube. "All-natural" ice cream is right.

They could rotate flavors more frequently and be open even later, but otherwise they are doing everything right. They even have a creamy vegan option, way to accommodate everyone!

Even at 9:30pm on a cold cold night in the city, this place STILL has a line! Last night was when I lost my Bi-Rite virginity - swung by after grabbing dinner with the girls and as we drove past, I was already like damn, this place has to be good, look at all those people willing to stand in line for it - when it was SUPER cold. Had a scoop of their famous salted caramel and another scoop of their blood orange sorbet.  Nice and sour, just the way I likes it. Both balls on top of a sugar cone of course ;)  No Earl Grey that day but both were yummy. They also give out samples in case you're a little intimidated and not sure which flavor to get.

My fave combo: Salted Caramel & Earl Grey. The best combo ever! The strong flavors of the salted caramel goes perfectly with the refreshing earl grey. Too bad the last two times I went they didn't offer earl grey (total bummers), but instead I paired my salted caramel with the brown sugar ginger (good, but the salted caramel really over powers the brown sugar ginger). I've also paired it with lavender, but after awhile you get kinda sick of it. I just can't stop thinking about the salted caramel and earl grey together. my mouth is salivating just thinking about it. I wish I could get some now!

I really LOVE the ice cream here ! I tried the salted caramel and honey lavender flavors & it was amazingggg ! The line seemed super long at first since it circled around the corner of the building. Surprisingly, it only took 20-25 minutes to reach the front of the line! It was national ice cream day yesterday so there was a worker asking customers questions about ice cream for card punches (buy 10 get 1 free) or if you answered all five questions correctly then you receive an ice cream book. The ice cream is definitely worth the wait ! =)

I had to try this place after the reputation it earned to be on yahoo's top ice cream shops. I tried the strawberry balsamic ice cream and it tasted like a watered down strawberry ice cream. How does ice cream taste more like water??? Maybe I had a poorly made batch that day. I also had bought an ice cream cake. I believe it was something with peanut brittle. The brittle had a burnt taste to it and the ice cream was not creamy at all. The bread was very dry and the only moistness it had was when the ice cream melted on it. All in all I wish I was impressed, but sad to say I wasn't. I had to give it stars because although I wasn't a fan, there was a line out the door and other people seem to like it so they have to get some credit right? Also the staff was helpful.

There's always a decent wait for Bi-rite but today was an absolutely gorgeous day in sf so the line went around the block. They had their side window open where they serve soft serve and other "treats" and there was no line there so I decided to check it out. I usually just go through the main area, but this little window ended up being a nice surprise. Turns out you can get ice cream sandwiches there! Popsicles too which were cheap! Had two of their ice cream sandwiches: balsamic strawberry with sugar cookies and coffee with brown butter cookies. Balsamic strawberry was solid. Ice cream wasn't overly sweet (the cookies brought the sugar) and the cookies were nice and soft so you didn't get that mega squish factor that usually happens when you take a big bite of an ice cream cookie sandwich. Coffee ice cream was easily some of the best I've had. You could even see the grinds :))). Brown butter cookies were very subtle, but the flavor came out more as you ate along. My advice is to give the side window a try because they had 4 choices of sandwiches and lots of other treats there that looked great.

The husband and I spent a recent weekend in SF, visiting family, and a trip to Bi-Rite Creamery was on my MUST DO list. We went on Friday afternoon and the line was pretty short and moved quickly. I had the toasted coconut and roasted banana ice creams. DELICIOUS! Very smooth and creamy, richly flavored, and nice-sized scoops. I was pretty bummed we couldn't get back over there again before we had to go home.

Bi-Rite always has a huge line. We went when they were about to close and the line was still so long! We tried the salted caramel. It was very salty and rich, but it wasn't my favorite. We also had a sam's sundae with the olive oil. That was very interesting, but I wouldn't be able to eat it all the time. I think ice cream with olive oil is an acquired taste. It was a good experience, but it's not my favorite ice cream in the city.

If I lived closer to Delores Park, I swear I would gain 10 pounds from the daily visits to Bi-Rite Creamery. So it's a good thing that I have to make a drive and that parking can be difficult, which makes the lazy nature overcome my ice cream cravings... maybe. I absolutely LOVE this place. LOVE. The line moves fast, the staff takes care of business, friendly neighborhood and best of all, delicious ice cream!! There are two lines - one for soft serve and pastries and one for the ice cream. You want to get the ice cream. Everyone raves about the Salted Caramel. I tried that and the Malted Vanilla (vanilla with peanut brittle). But I actually got a cone with Cookies n Cream and the Ricanelas (cinnamon and snickerdoodle). What makes BiRite the best is the texture of the ice cream - just the right amount of creamy. I thoroughly thoroughly enjoyed every lick and bite. Coming back? Is that even a question?

The best Ice Cream ever? I think so. This small ice cream shop has insane flavors that I have never tasted before. I got the malted vanilla(Amazing) and something with snicker doodles in it. For 3. 50, you can get 2 scoops that melt very very fast. If you plan on eating your ice cream slow, get it in a cup, otherwise you will be slurping your ice cream nonstop.

Two words:  Salted Caramel. The salted caramel ice cream here is, to put it simply, the best ice cream I have ever had in my life.  (And I have had a lot of ice cream.) The only downside of this fact is that it means that none of Bi-Rites other flavors can *also* be the best ice cream I have ever had in my life, because they are all trumped by the salted caramel. Creme fraiche!  Balsamic strawberry!  I am sure I could have fallen in love with them too, but I simply can never bring myself to order anything other than the best.

A friend of mine who recently relocated to the bay area told me she found ice cream better than Fosselman's in Los Angeles.  I told her she was being blasphemous.  During a recent visit, she took me people watching at Dolores Park.  After 15 minutes of this, I was ready to go.  So we walked down the street to Bi-Rite where I was able to confirm/deny such blasphemous rumors. I ordered a single, which really means a double scoop (?), which ensued much confusion on my end.  If I had known and actually read their sign, I would've gotten two flavors instead of the boring old one.  Trial and error, I guess.  Bitterness aside, I ended up getting the ricanela on a cone.  That cone.  Was.  BOMB.  It was light and crispy, not dense, brittle, crumbly, or overly sugary.  Perfection.  The ice cream was tasty, as I enjoyed the cinnamon and cookie bits.  But that cone, it was something else. Can't say it's "better" than my beloved Fosselman's, but it's definitely up there.  I'll need to try the salted caramel and maybe one of those delicious looking sundaes on my next trip.

Being that I had joined the froyo revolution, I felt like I was cheating on my cause when I came to Bi-Rite.  But seeing the line that was out the door, I couldn't help but to line up and found out what the deal-o is.  As we lined up, we saw a chalkboard list of flavors...which is a great sign because they claim they make all their flavors in small batches so their flavors rotate.  Thumbs up for them on that.  I thought I'd play it safe and go with the honey lavender...I liked it and I literally tasted lavender which is strange for me since I usually take whiffs of it in the bathroom.   Next time, I'm coming here to try the balsamic strawberry flavor and maybe that snickerdoodle one too...Please forgive me froyo gods for my future unfaithful transgressions...unfaithfulness has never tasted so sweet!

Ice cream you can SCREAM for! It's so worth the trip.  Even on a hot day and with thousands of people milling around Dolores Park for Pride festivities. I braced myself for a lengthy wait, but it turned out to only be 20 minutes.  The shop is small, but they are well-versed in taking your order quickly and moving the line along. You can get 1-2 flavors with the single size and 2-3 flavors with the double size.  Between the three of us we tried the honey lavendar, ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodle), almond cherry, cookies and cream and of course, the LEGENDARY salted caramel.  So good.

The SNOZZBERRIES TASTE LIKE SNOZZBERRIES!! Ok, but seriously.  I'm going to predict your future if you plan on coming to Bi-Rite. -You'll stand in line and enjoy the aroma of ice cream shop.  You'll look at the list of flavors and wonder. -You'll order something crazy like lemon grass vanilla and think to yourself  "It probably won't be that close to the actual flavor." -You'll get your ice cream and think "Holy crap!  This tastes more like lemon grass vanilla than real lemon grass and vanilla" -You'll at least entertain the thought of returning here anytime you walk by regardless of how full you are, the previous meal just consumed or time of day. WARNING:  If you're thinking of coming here on an unusually hot SF day, trust me, everyone else is thinking the same thing.

Considering that I am lactose intolerant, it is definitely hard to please me when it comes to ice cream!  I have to be very very careful because I will throw it up if I have too much of it but I swear if it is worth eating, I will literally force it down...who cares if I throw it up! lol okay sorry that was a little too graphic (but if you're wondering, I didn't throw it up today lol) Honestly, I really only go to one place which is Mitchell's on San Jose Ave..  Mitchell's is a whole 'notha story and I will never ever trade it for anything in the world but this...this...this...Bi-Rite creamery is sure to please, hands down the most savory and flavorful ice cream I have ever tasted.  I had the roasted banana and honey lavender, my friend had the ricanelas-ohhhh my god! I'm in awe and words cannot speak to how I feel about the taste of this ice cream, you are just going to have to try it!  Can't wait to try more flavors!!!! 5 Stars for you Bi-Rite! Oh you know what what else is cool?  They give samples on silver spoons and their containers and spoons are totally recyclable-SCORE!!!!!!

Thursday, 9:30PM. Shout-out to those who told me it was imperative that I visit Bi-Rite Creamery. The website indicates that Bi-Rite uses organic ingredients and engages in sustainable business/environmental practices. Awesome, awesome, awesome! Now, it just has to taste gooooood. We found a sweet parking spot right in front of the shop. Hopped out, stoked as heck, and saw the dreaded "CLOSED" sign. Ahhhh! Floral lady to the side of the front entrance informed me that the creamery was 40-50 feet west of the Bi-Rite Market. Needless to say, my party and I were rejuvenated, despite me feeling like a dork and thinking the market was the creamery. Signs on the creamery door says they're getting a bigger shop and I can see why. Line was out the door, despite the dang rain and despite being 9:45PM in the evening. You know it's gotta be legit if it's freezing, wet, and people still want the goods. Though there were six people ahead of us, we were ordering before we knew it. Yes, you can sample stuff too! If I wasn't so full from dinner, I'd be sampling for days. Final Call: Since there were only three seats inside, we ate the scoops standing...but you know what? It doesn't matter because the quality of the ice cream was outtttta this world. I intend to try ALL the FLAVORS! ********** Stuffed my face in: 1. Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces     +Generally don't like malted anything but the pieces made this a     winner 2. Ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles)     +++Biased alert: I love snickerdoodles and this flavor was     essentially chewy cookies in ice cream (ORGASMIC for 'doodle     lovers!) 3. Cookies and Cream     +Not too creamy and the cookies avoided being rigid 4. Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl     +I avoid ginger desserts but there's only a hint of it in this one     because the su-su-sugar allays the ginger's sting

I love ice cream. I made ice cream once in chemistry in high school. It didn't come out as good as Bi-Rite's ice cream. I actually haven't gone out for ice cream in a while. I'm mainly been on a froyo streak lately, but after my friend told me about Bi-Rite, I was excited as hell to try it. Last Sunday, I finally fulfilled my dream. We skipped indoors a couple minutes before it was about to close, though the store was still super packed. Got a sample of the roasted banana (they give you samples with real metal spoons! very eco-friendly), and though I usually don't like banana that much, this sort of banana was awesome. Got one scoop banana, one scoop earl grey (because I love tea) in a eco-friendly cup, topped with an ice cream cone. Sat at a small wooden table in front of a water fountain, watched my friends do a check-in on foursquare with their iPhones and jealously wished I had one too.

Yes, there's a cult following of this place...and for reason. We had the Ricanelas (cinnamon w/ snickerdoodles). I would have preferred more cinnamon or something funky w/ the snickerdoodle flavor. Not bad, but I've had better Bi-Rite flavors. 2nd flavor of the dish: Brown Butter Pecan - music to this (partly) Southern girl's ears! It was almost better than the pie in my opinion. Next time I'm going for the soft serve as that counter also had interesting flavors (& not 1/2 as many people waiting in line). Definitely a "scene" here.

4.5 Stars I want ice cream just like everyone else so expect a line and to wait during peak times.  If you don't want to wait, just stay at home! There'll be more ice cream for me..muahahah :) If you tough it out though you'll experience genuinely unique flavors you cannot get anywhere else. Single - $3.25 - One or two flavors Double - $4.75 - Two or three flavors Triple - $5.95 - Three or four flavors They give you ACTUAL metal spoons to try the ice cream.  I highly recommend the Salted Caramel if you like a mixture of sweet and salty.  Another good combo is the Roasted Banana and Toasted Coconut.  The Toasted Coconut even has actual coconut shavings. This place serves up some legendary ice cream and I'm happy the weather is starting to warm up.  Be sure to bring your frequent buyers card because if you fill up 10 punches, you'll get a single scoop for FREE.  Parking can also be tough so I highly recommend taking the MUNI if you live in SF. == A MUST TRY! ==

Hype gives +10 taste points. Bi-Rite is pretty darn good I'd have to say, just because there aren't any ice cream parlors like this in my neighborhood. It was a Saturday afternoon that we decided to trek to SF for a spontaneous trip. (spontaneous it was, good and bad) It was a pretty warm day for early April. Line was out the door, the usual. Like other reviewers have mentioned they have a great variety of flavors. I expected salted caramel to blow my mind, but it was a bit too...salty for my liking. I expected more of a starbucks salted caramel hot chocolate. So we opted for snickerdoodle and toasted coconut. Both were faaaab. Single scoop on a cone for like $2.50? Beats 31BR anyday. Would definitely stop by for an ice cream fix if we were in the neighborhood. Parking is a little pain in the A$$ though. SF meter maids are ruthless creatures.

The line was out the door and around the corner. I knew that my friend and I were in for a treat. Balsamic strawberry, earl grey tea, & salted caramel, oh my! Such amazing flavors. I was really impressed by the earl grey tea - I had never tried anything like it before. The flavors are so vibrant and fresh! How do they do infuse the ice cream with that much flavor? Simply magical. I went on the perfect weekend, clear skies and warm weather. In other words, ICE CREAM WEATHER. I'm a fan, I'll be back, next time I visit SF :)

"Wait...what the...oh hell no." My thoughts as I drove down 18th and AROUND the corner to Delores street gazing a the monstrosity that was the Bi-Rite line.  My girlfriend had spoken nothing but good things about the Bi-Rite, and was excited in being able to finally take me. My anger reached its apex though when it took me 15 minutes to find parking and I ended up walking 10 minutes. It's a good thing that I love my girlfriend. It's another thing that Bi-Rite absolutely kicks ass.  The line went quicker than usual, and I was impressed with their flavors.  We settled on the Balsamic Strawberry, the Coffee Toffee, and the Salted Caramel Flavor, and sat ourselves down at Delores Park. I could care less really that the flavors are organic, but this was some great tasting ice cream.  The Salted Caramel eventually melted and acted as a bit of a topping on the coffee and strawberry flavors, and each bite was great.   Definitely one of the best ice cream creameries in the Bay.

WOW! This place meet expectations. I was so stuffed after lunch but I still wanted to try this place, I only got a kid scoop, but the serving was SOO generous. I saw the guy expertly dig and shape the honey lavender into a perfect ball of sweetness. The ice creams almost looked like gelato, so smooth and creamy- with the right amount of sweetness. Extra stars and thumbs up to the biodegradable cups and the "pride sundae" to celebrate the gay pride celebrations the next day- I love it when local businesses really support their neighborhood :)

Treat Ice Cream in San Jose held the crown for the best Bay Area ice cream for me, and I'd heard so much about Bi-Rite, that it was time to see if it could take the title. After suffering the parking situation in the Mission, I wasn't going to just get one flavor. No, I got the Balsamic Strawberry, Coffee Toffee, and Earl Grey to eat there - and the Salted Caramel to take home. Earl Grey - It really tasted like Earl Grey tea, not just a hint of it, but it was like a cup of tea in ice cream form. Unfortunately Earl Grey Tea isn't the most exciting thing in the world - so this didn't really wow me. I was hoping for some other flavors to amp up the overall taste. Coffee Toffee - My favorite flavor. Bold taste, and chunks of delicious crunchy toffee, what's not to like? Balsamic Strawberry - Also very good, I was afraid it would taste like Balsamic Vinegar in ice cream form, which is a mildly scary proposition. But this was not the case. Salted Caramel - My second favorite. This is as good as everyone says it is, with a nice contrast between sweet and salty. Plain old caramel ice cream would be far too boring. Bi-Rite has very innovative flavors, but as far as quality of the ice cream itself goes, and execution of the simpler flavors, Treat Ice Cream is still the winner for me. But Bi-Rite is definitely worth checking out, especially if you want something different from plain old vanilla or chocolate ice cream.

Bi-Rite.....where have you been my whole life?  After a 10 min wait in line (not bad considering the park was full of picnics waiting for fireworks on a Sunday afternoon) we were transported to a sampling frenzy of every flavor they had available.  I chose the salted caramel and the brown sugar.  While the salted caramel is amazing....the perfect ratio of sweet and salty ...I was just udderly (ha - I crack myself up...) amazed by the brown sugar ice cream and the ribbon of ginger caramel running through.  It is very sweet which is just how I like things!  Other orders with my friends included the sam's sundae (brownie goooooooood!) and the snickerdoodle ice cream (highly recommend if you love cinnamon).   I have a feeling we will be back very soon with coolers in hand to purchase some pints! Now I think I have to add bi-rite to my last meal request....

I didn't get the hype but like everyone else, I stood in line on a cool treat on a hot day. Not until today did I fully realize the awesomeness of salted caramel ice cream. It was featured on a list of things one must eat in SF. So glad I did. I'll put it in the top ten list of foods I've ever eaten. Yes, that good. I'll have to wait in line for a scoop every time I go to D Park. minus one star for the wait.

Never fear, sc. I still bought two pints of you for me & a couz. We will have fantastic desserts for a little while. ;) I still scream for sc and maybe more new favorites soon!

After seeing it on Yelp and dreaming about trying it for months, I finally got a chance to try it today. Delicious. I went around 7pm and there was only a short line of four people in front of me. I'm glad I didn't have to wait! I can tell they're really into the green-movement. First, they use metal spoons for sampling. Second, they only have a recycle bin (no trash!). Pretty cool! I sampled the creme fraishe and was disappointed that the fancy name was code for plain ol' vanilla. I also tried the salty caramel which was really interesting. I enjoyed it, but I wanted something a little sweeter. I ended up with the white chocolate blackberry in a kids cup. It cost $2.25 for a scoop, which happened to be the perfect size for me at the time. I definitely would have wanted more had I not just eaten a slice of cake 10 minutes prior. I really don't know what it is, but Bi-Rite has a certain quality or taste to it different from other ice creams. It's delicious! It wasn't too sweet for me and not too creamy. Next time, I want to try lavender honey. Seriously, who else makes flavors so interesting???

In the constant struggle between who's got the better ice cream, Mitchell's or Bi-Rite, I have to say the edge goes to Bi-Rite. I just find the flavors more enticing to my palate. I appreciate the care they take to provide an ice cream that has local, sustainable, and organic ingredients that shine in each flavor. My favorite is the Balsamic Strawberry, which has the slight tang from the balsamic and the strawberries used are fresh and sweet. I've also sampled the ever-popular Salted Caramel, which pops with caramel. Sometimes caramel can have that burnt taste to it but this was made perfectly and the salt heightens every sense on the tongue. The Roasted Banana is also a hit with me. It tastes more of like a sorbet to me rather than an ice cream because the banana flavor is so incredibly intense. Sam's Sundae is a unique amalgamation of ingredients. Who would have thought to put chocolate ice cream, olive oil, sea salt, and whipped cream into a dessert? On a recent visit, I had to try it and see what all the fuss is about. I gotta say it was unusual though. The Bergamot olive oil had a fruity, almost floral taste to it. The chocolate was some of the best chocolate ice cream I've had. The flakes of Maldon sea salt are not distributed throughout so in one bite you can have too much salt whereas in another you can have just a bit of it. Trust me, this ice cream is worth standing in a long ass line in the bitter SF cold for.

Voted on of the best ice cream places by many review articles out there, it's no question that Bi-Rite is simply "As good as it gets!" With unique flavors made daily at the creamery, Bi-Rite is sure to satisfy everyones' craving. I always hit this place up when traveling to San Francisco. With all the buzz surrounding it, there's often a line out the door that comes with the trouble of finding parking. There is the creamery itself and the less busy soft serve stand to the side of it. They have set flavors as well as seasonal flavors that range from Mexican Chocolate to Balsamic Strawberry. They also sell goodies on the side such as cookies and ice cream sandwiches. Although if you go there to just pick up a pint, don't wait in line and grab one out of the fridge and pay for it at the counter.=] I usually get Honey Lavender, it's sweet with a hint of lavender that leaves me wanting more! I also enjoy the toasted coconut and balsamic strawberry. They cook the strawberries in balsamic vinegar- this makes the sweetness of the strawberries stronger. It's close to the Bi-Rite market so unless you want to go to both locations, don't mix the two up. It's definitely a place to stop at while on your trip to S.F.! Happy Eatings! =]

Maybe I'm just not the typical ice-cream fan, but I didn't think Bi-Rite lived up to its hype... and I was also in a snorlax state of mind (sleeping everywhere lol) From what I remembered, my friends and I just shared salted caramel and the honey lavender. The flavors were pretty interesting... I prefer salted caramel over the honey lavender. Both flavors were not too overwhelming, and it tastes exactly what it sounds like. They were both pretty unique, but I realize that I like the more typical ice cream flavors :x This place is pretty comparable to Ici's in Berkeley (which I prefer over Bi-Rite!) Although both ice cream places are comparable, I like Ici's overall texture and consistency over Bi-Rite's. Next time I come here, I'd definitely try the sundaes rather than just scoops of different ice cream flavors. Maybe it'd change my mind (and my taste buds)

My favorite ice cream place ever, because of its unique flavors I can't get anywhere else and they are soooooo good!  My favorite flavors here are the earl gray and the malted vanilla.  I have never had earl gray ice cream before, and once I tried it I fell in love with it.  I am a big fan of tea and this flavor rocks my socks! Yesterday I Ricanelas for the first time and loved it!  If you are a big fan of snickerdoodle cookies then this is a good flavor for you to try!  The ice cream is super creamy, and there are many chunks of snickerdoodles in the ice cream!  I've never had snickerdoodles ice cream in my life!  Sooo good! Other notable flavors are roasted banana and cookies and cream. One thing about this place I hate is the long long lines at all hours and days!  But I love it so much I think it is totally worth the wait.  The best things in life are worth the wait =)  Well maybe a half hour wait...

The BEST ice cream in SF! Perfect amount with the perfect taste. There are days when I drool and dream over their salted caramel, ricanella and malted vanilla with peanut brittle.   It's worth the wait because you get a sweet treat at the end. Go Bi-Rite! Hooray for Bi-Rite!  I scream...you scream...we all scream for Bi-Rite. (Can you sense my enthusiasm or I'm just sugar high?) I want like 20 scoops of ______, please.   Happy Yelping!

You better believe that every time I go to SF, Bi-Rite is on the itinerary. Everyday. Salted Caramel and Roasted Banana are my favorite flavors. I'm usually not a fan of banana flavors in ice cream cause it tastes really artificial to me but, not at Bi-Rite. The salted caramel is not overwhelming at all and I have yet to find any other ice cream shop that can top it. Small selection of flavors but, all so yummy!

By far, THE BEST ice cream shop that I have ever been to! We came here because of all the good Yelp reviews, and am so glad we did. I will definitely be back for more yumminess! The Coffee Toffee is what I recommend for you coffee lovers (like me!) out there. You should also try the Salted Caramel ice cream. My friends gushed about how great it was. This place is one of those secret treasures in the city so make sure that you stop by here before you leave! Make sure you aren't in a hurry though because the line is usually long, but it is most definitely worth the wait.

This is how I know Bi-Rite Creamery is PERFECT. I brought my friends here citing that this is the place to be in San Francisco. Parking was a slight pain, but hey - no pain, no gain right? Come earlier to plan your time in line and then relax in the park afterwards!! I entered Bi-Rite's LINE and was saddened to see the lack of Earl Grey. No matter... everything is good there! That was my loyal thought, so when I got to the front, I asked to try their Snickerdoodle flavour and Green tea. I couldn't help it. Even though I wanted to try everything else or stick to my favourite Honey Lavendar, I had to go and get the Snickerdoodle/Green tea combination. Strange? Trust me, if you walk out of Bi-Rite with a single scoop, you're doing a great Creamery wrong. Munching on my ice-cream, I quickly scoured my friends' options. Oh my god, brown sugar was heaven in my mouth. I wanted to trade with my friend until I tried the salted caramel and changed my mind again. Then I went back to eating my own ice-cream and felt so satisfied with my decision. Never have I felt so polar with food decisions before. Everything was amazing. See the thing with Bi-Rite is that there is no "right" or "wrong" option. Many restaurants/food places have that unfortunate addition. I used to think that all establishments had their good and bads, but that doesn't exist with Bi-Rite. It is perfect.

My FAVORITE ice cream place! Boy, if this was in my neighborhood, I'd be here everyday...hot summer day or not! Typically, I am not a big ice cream fan. I like baked goods much more...cookies, brownies, pastries etc. but this place rooooooccccckkkksss! The best thing about Bi-Rite is their ice cream is fresh and oh so simple. To break it down: Salted Caramel- a must try. It has not only a nutty caramel flavor, but also a little bit of coffee (?)...something tastes a little strong (but a good strong). Mexican Chocolate- Not sure if this is one of their special flavors and only available certain days, but it is freakin' awesome. It's a wholesome chocolate flavor with a kick of cinnamon and spice :) Totally my kinda thing. Roasted Banana: AMAZING for banana lovers. Just like you're actually having the fruit except in creamy, cold form. Bi-Rite, can you please open one of your delicious stores in the South Bay? pretty puhleeeze.

Bi-Rite have very original flavors and also continue to try new ones constantly. I know it's overhyped, but salted caramel is the best tasting flavor of ice cream on earth.   Terrible parking and I hear the lines can get long. I will be sure to try other flavors when i happen to be in the area.

3.5 stars. I got the salted caramel (a little too sweet / bitter for me) and the honey lavender (I like lavender, but wasn't anything TOO special because the lavender wore off and it was more creamy / vanilla). Would come here again, but wouldn't go out of my way. Want to try something else. They had a sugar cookie flavor (Ricoan...?) that I thought was good when I tasted it. Parking is hard to find.

I'm a big fan of bi-rite because of how supportive they are of community events. I'm a fan of the creamery because its oh so delicious. On a rare warm day in SF, I sometimes venture off into the Mission for some good food and dessert, dessert is usually split between tartine and bi-rite. My favorite flavors at bi-rite are: Honey Lavender, Balsamic Strawberry and Cookies and Cream. Next time I'm going for the salter caramel.

On a moderately warm Sunday afternoon, the line for this place was out the door, along the building and around the corner. Several sources had recommended this place, and I wasn't in any hurry, so I decided to wait. Thank God for smartphones. As I approached the door, the group in front of me passed back a menu. There were plenty of interesting options, but I knew I only had one shot at this, so I decided on the Double (which is actually 2-3 flavors of your choice) and went with Honey Lavender, Toasted Marshmallow, and Balsamic Strawberry. The first two flavors were really well executed.  The Balsamic Strawberry could use a bit more balsamic, though. A couple drops of aged balsamic or a few ounces of a reduced balsamic would go miles here, as it had only a slight tang to differentiate it from any other (good) strawberry ice cream. Is it worth it? I guess that depends on how much you like ice cream, want to try interesting flavors, and have something to do standing in line.

I came here the other night after discovering Bombay Ice Creamery was already closed for the day. Like Bombay, they have lots of unique flavors (salted caramel: yum; ginger: pretty darn gingery, but still good; chai spiced milk chocolate: kind of watery and not as good as I'd hoped; mint chip: nice and minty), so I was able to fill my need for some good, but also different ice cream. I love that they use compostable cups and spoons and that they have ice cream sandwiches. However, I don't like that there isn't much room inside (and hardly anywhere to sit), that everything is just a bit more expensive than I feel it ought to be, and that they don't make milkshakes. If they did, I bet they'd be darn tasty. I'll be back though. I really want to try their sundaes--they all sound so delicious!

If you're trying to decide if it's worth waiting in line, or if it's one of Those Places that just has tons of reviews but, you know, is just so so -- no, it's really that good. SO good, that -- especially given the amount of actually useful content in the other 2000 reviews -- the rest of the review I can express only thus: salted caramel salted caramel salted caramel. Salted caramel. Ice cream love. Salted caramel. Orange cardamom orange cardamom salted caramel. Salted caramel.

Most flavors are a bit too sweet for me. Gotta warn you the LONG LINES. we had: SALTY CARAMEL:  i had to get this since 7x7 said it's on their list of 100 must try.  It was too sweet for me BROWN SUGAR W/  GINGER CARAMEL : not my thing ROASTED BANANA:  yummmmmm.  Reminds of the ice cream truck's banana-chocolate popsicle, but just the banana part. MEYER LEMON:  my fave for the night and the least sweet.  I wish there was a bit more lemon sour to it but i love the creaminess.

I just could not give this place anything higher than 3-stars. I had a single scoop of the toasted coconut and it just left me asking, "why so many stars?" I didn't really taste the "toasted" coconuts and the ice cream was not really that creamy. Parking was horrible and I think that is the norm. For my dime, Mitchell's is better.

We finally get there and the line was super short.  So we got the salted caramel and also decided to get a pint for the next day. OMG THIS FLAVOR WAS INCREDIBLE!!!  This is the only one I tried but looking forward to the next visit. I will definately wait if there is a line when I have a craving.

Wowsa, I love love love love this place. For my money it has the best ice cream I have ever had. The line can be long, so go prepared. And parking isn't all that fun either, so take the Muni. But their flavors are delicious, and their salted caramel is my favorite ice cream I've ever had. The people that work there are super friendly, and if the line is too long you can always walk 10 feet down the street to their soft-serve window, which also has pastries...including a salted caramel cupcake! My personal choice every time I go is the Sam's Sundae. It normally comes with chocolate ice cream, which is great, but you can have whatever flavor(s) you want in it. Personally I go for Salted Caramel and Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces. The sundae has bergamot olive oil and maldon salt  the sweet and salty combinations in this bowl are amazing! The oil is fruity...it's not like dumping olive oil in ice cream. Nothing like that, in fact. It's a green oil that is not actually infused with bergamot citrus, but instead is crushed along with the olives and the juice is centrifuged out. (Bergamot is the lemony fruit that gives Earl Gray its flavor). If you can only go to one place for dessert or a treat in SF, this should be it.

Not the only ice cream shop worth going to - but arguably the best ice cream place in the city. I'm docking about a half-star for being a little overambitious with some of their flavors. Some of what they offer, I dream of. for example Salt Caramel. Or a Salt Caramel brownie fudge sundae. With Caramel Agh Gad. (drooling)

Only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because I'm a stickler when it comes to giving out 5 star reviews. I must absolutely be blown away by the food or product and in the case of Bi-Rite I was definitely happy with my purchase, but it wasn't life changing. Not like the gelato I had that one time in Italy. That said, Bi-Rite is a definite must-do for anyone visiting San Francisco. It may not look like much, just a tiny little ice cream shop by Dolores Park, but you'll notice it (esp on a weekend) because there's a long line out the door and down the street of people waiting for a taste of that Honey Lavender goodness. Prices seem decent - and I prefer my ice cream to be higher priced anyway so I don't buy it that often. Many of the flavors are unique, which I appreciate -- Coffee Toffee was - yum! - and I'm dying to try Balsamic Strawberry. A small cone comes with two flavors and it was something like $3.50. Perfect afternoon treat if you happen to be in The Mission.

So I want to let all my friends know that I am moving.  Where you ask?  To about 18th and Dolores in San Francisco.  It is a strategic move you see.  Because I finally went to Bi-Rite for the first time in my life and I don't think I can imagine my life without it anymore, and really don't want to be any further away than where I can roll my soon to be very chunky self through their front doors. I thank Bi-Rite for giving me a new purpose in life: to try all their flavors at least a couple hundred times and to not go broke when buying insanely large quantities of their salted caramel.

Some of the best ice cream I've had! I got the ginger snap sundae (or something) and was offered either the regular size or the small size by the employee, which was greatly appreciated because the small was still plenty! The ice cream was superb, the berry compote was good, and the whipped cream was delicious. I went sometime at night, so there was barely any line. It was also cold out, which probably had something to do with that. I'll definitely be back when I visit again! I think I'll have to try the salted caramel next time judging by the other reviews.

There is always a line outside of this little shop no matter what time of the day you're coming! Their ice cream is amazing. You can sample as many flavors as you want before deciding, and they use actual spoons that they constantly rewash. Make sure you order the 'ricanelas' if you're a snickerdoodle fan, it is DELICIOUS.

As if we weren't full enough from dinner at Chez Papa, we came here last night for second round of dessert! (Yes, we are pigs! So what?!?!) Since my warm chocolate cake lacked ice cream, I justified myself with a treat at Bi-Rite! The flavors here are all so unique! I wanted to try everything!! I settled on a small scoop split between two flavors. 1) Chai spiced chocolate: YUM! I love chai, so this was my favorite! Chocolate ice cream was infused with spicy chai flavor and it came with chunks of chocolate. 2) Salted caramel: I had to get it of course. It was very creamy and sweet. I didn't taste too much salt, but I think that's a good thing. I also tried the Roasted banana. YUM, banana is one of my all time favorite flavors and this one tasted like real bananas. I tried the blood orange granita too. Tasted like the real thing! It was in the 50s last night and this place was packed! Definitely worth a trip here for ice cream if you're in the neighbor.

These people are so nice.* Where do they come from? I was trying samples and got guilty about it even though they use real spoons and not those sad wasteful plastic spatulas and was ready to order but the guy was like, "No, you should try this one too. And this one." Then I ordered and was delighted to find that a "single" scoop is actually *two* flavors, so I didn't even have to decide between lavender and salt caramel, which is an indescribable sensation in your mouth, drip drip. Then I sheepishly asked if they wouldn't mind filling up my Crystal Geyser water bottle with tap water (I'm on a budget, people!) and he said not at all, and his co-worker girl smiled at me not in a condescending, "I can't believe you're so cheap and granola-y" way but in a "right-on my green sista" kind of way, and I was so happy I nearly laughed aloud. *Okay, only on weekdays.

My friend Robert G. and I were discussing tonight how Bi-Rite might just be the best ice cream in the world (Italian gelato excluded because it gets to be in a category of its own) over a double scoop of salted butter caramel and brown butter pecan ice cream. Made with Strauss organic milk (which, if you've ever tried it, is naturally sweeter than other milks and it's one of our local dairies!), they have all sorts of exotic flavors (i.e. strawberry basalmic, ginger, and my favorite, salted butter caramel), make their own ice cream sandwiches from scratch, and even have a sundae with olive oil and salt as a topping... I don't know why you'd go to any other place in the city for ice cream.

Because I love ice cream I would have given this place 5 stars. Because I don't like ridiculously loud music and getting my order wrong twice due to no one being able to hear a thing over the silly loud music I am detracting one of those stars. But this is NOT a negative review. The ice cream is delicious. Fully freaking yumtastic. The flavors are just out of the box enough to make every single one crave-able, without any fear of wanting to spit it out. They have a lovely balance of creative spins on old favorites and I'd definitely recommend stopping by!

Thank you Jesus, Buddha, Mohammed, Ra, Flying Spaghetti Monster, Earth Mother, athiest "god", whomever you believe in for this amazing little ice cream heaven.  Ho-lee MAMA! I was visiting San Fran recently (one of my fave cities), and a friend who lives here made us go to this out of the way joint near Mission.  Dearest Lord it was tasty!  It is a tiny store, to be sure, and there isn't much seating but who gives a rat's butt.  The ice cream was incredible. I did the double, I think, where I could get three kinds of ice cream.  Because, folks, this fat kid needs three kinds of ice cream.  I tried the Mint Chocolate Chip (tasty yummy), the salted caramel (superb), and the roasted banana.  The roasted banana now sits in the top three all-time favoritest ice creamy tasty treats ever!  IN-FREAKIN'-CREDIBLE! My friends tried other flavors...and of course I sampled.  The pear sorbet was amazing and actually tasted like REAL pear!  In fact, all of the ice creams tasted like they had real ingredients in them made with care.  So good. Now...as you know (or don't know at all), I rarely give out 5 stars.  Um...I wish I could give this place 12.  So fantastic.  If you get to this area, just go!  Don't think about it...do it!

So, so so good. I had the roasted banana and chocolate, but I tried several other flavors. Everything positive that has been said is true. Clearly high quality and  all natural, unlike the fake flavor extravaganza at Mitchell's. Yeah, I said it. Every flavor I tried was rich, smooth and full of flavor. I will say, though, that I was shocked by the cone I received: a tasteless, out of the box, cake cone. It was nasty and I threw it away (I had it on top of my cup - that way, enjoy the cone, but no rush to chow down on the ice cream before making a mess. I have a system.). I would really expect a place like this to have great cones - waffle or sugar, but not just cake out of the box! Yuck! Also, I felt bad for the server who got in a little trouble by two employee for making my man's serving too large. He must agree with some Yelpers.   :)

We all scream for Ice Cream!!! Well maybe, I'm a Mitchelle's ice cream snob.. I just love the long menu of flavors.. however since I love ice cream I try to not discriminate too much. Last Friday was total ice cream weather. A. and I decided to walk the franks in the hood and visit Bi-Rite Creamery. Always a line out the door... I order Toffee Coffee and he ordered some type of coconut... One lick of the Toffee Coffee and I switched.. A. has a MAJOR sweet tooth, I bet he'd put sugar on top of all his sweets if he could. :) Me? Well I always considered myself a sweets lover and I am, but sometimes too sweet is just that, too sweet.. That's what happened with the Toffee Coffee... tooooooo sweet for me.. A. loved it. The coconut ice cream was nice.. way better.. Mitchelle's is still my fav. :)

It is so good we have been her three times in the past week. The line may look long, but it really only takes around 20-25 minutes which is totally worth it. We've tried the Sam's Sundae, Berry Sundae, and Banana Split Sundae. SO DELICIOUS. I could eat the whipped cream forever *drool*. You have to give the banana split a try. They caramalize sugar on the bananas so it has a little extra crunch which makes it absolutely heavenly. All the ice cream is so creamy and the flavors are so delicious--I'm drooling as I think about it. The prices aren't too bad either. $5-$6 for a sundae isn't too bad. The serving size isn't humongous but for the quality, it's definitely worth the price!

Just get the damn Salted Caramel and shut up about it already. Really, it is THAT good. Props to uber-Yelper Graham R. for absolutely nailing the most amazing comparison: the flavor is definitely reminiscent of a See's Candies caramel lollipop. If you don't know what that tastes like your Bay Area cred just took a serious hit. Another 5 stars for Graham R. and his beautiful black scooter, who often scoot to my house carrying such wonderful Yelp-approved treats as this ice cream, Blue Bottle coffee beans, Ike's sandwiches, and La Boulange bread. We should all be so lucky to have friends like these.

While this page was loading I was pondering to myself about this place probably having a bunch of great reviews already and if I should write or not.. And then up pops that Bi-Rite has over 3,000 reviews!!  Wow! They deserve it too!  I went the other day after a day of shopping in the city to be peasantly treated to a delicious bowl of salted caramel and cookies and cream ice cream, topped with HOMEMADE brownie bites (a lot of them too), HOMEMADE hot fudge (that actually hardened like real fudge), and HOMEMADE whipped cream... Mmmmmmm I was NOT missing that high fructose corn syrup on this sundae!   It was amazingly great and totally worth the $6.50 I paid.  The employees were all really cool too and totally social and awesome even though it was freezing and probably 45 degrees. Definitely will go back!

Quality ice cream, deeeelicious flavors & wonderful atmosphere! Bi-Rite is the coziest ice cream shop with an awesome location, right down the street from Tartine and across the street from Dolores Park. After reading all the reviews, I'm a bit scared to admit that I'm not a fan of the famous Salted Caramel. I know I know, don't hate me! It was okay but I like some of their other flavors way more. For instance, the Roasted Banana is incredible mmmm. And my favorite flavor by far? The Creme freakin' Fraiche! SO GOOOOD! My boyfriend was kinda weirded out that I dug Creme Fraiche the most ("It's just cream!") but it was perfectly rich & just...YUM. I could have ate a whole bowl of just that one flavor. It's nice to see that they expanded the shop to seat more people inside and they're very efficient & friendly when serving their customers. My only other qualm is that I wish the servings were a litttle bit bigger. I'm totally spoiled by the likes of Mitchell's & their humongous scoops! But the reviews don't lie, Bi-Rite is definitely worth a stop in SF...believe the hype.

Here's the scoop: Service was friendly and prompt, line wasn't long and ice cream was legit! So many flavors to choose from and I savored the malted vanilla. Perfectly creamy, just the right amount of sweet. Milk chocolate swirled in with chunks of delicious peanut brittle. This cone's a winner!

3 stars for the flavor and flavors of ice creams. I'm a big fan of the salted caramels. If you love salted caramel try fran's chocolates. She has the best salted caramels. Anyways, I liked bi-rite's flavor of ice creams, but the texture isn't all that. When I went there I got two scoops, coffee toffee and salted caramel on a cone. I also bought a pint each at 7.99 so I could bring some home to my husband. I thought the salted caramel was too airy and didn't have the oomph creamy texture that I like in homemade ice creams. It was more like a mousse ice cream. For the coffee toffee there were too many icy bits that made the ice cream too flaky and not cohesive and creamy. Also the toffee just sucked. The toffee bits were sugary soft bits. They should just leave out the toffee. I'd like to go back to try more flavors, but i won't be buying pints anymore until after i try them.

Two reasons I continue to live in pricey and foggy San Francisco: 1) My husband 2) Salted Caramel Ice Cream Move over, Mitchells. The gentrification of the San Francisco Ice Cream scene has began (in a good way). This place has the BEST ice cream flavor in the whole world: salted caramel.  Sounds funky, but I assure you, it will be the best ice cream flavor you have ever tasted. Only if they had Dulce de leche, or queso or mango (not the sorbet kind) flavors as well...

From the moment I got there until I finished my last bite of ice cream, this place was packed with people! We got a 2 scoop cup with honey lavender and salty caramel. I wasn't much of a fan of the honey lavender. At first bite, it wasn't that bad, but then the aftertaste felt like I was eating a plant, twig or something earthy and herbal. The salty caramel was bomb diggity though.The blend of saltiness with a bit of sweet caramel was exceptional! I'll definitely be coming back here to try the other flavors, since the consistency and texture of ice cream was also superb! **update** came back here and tried their "brown sugar with ginger and caramel" and "Ricanelas cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodles". The brown sugar was too sweet for my tastes, but the Ricanelas was heavenly! I liked the hidden crunchiness that was within it.

Happy.  Hip.  Happenin' You know an ice creamery is legitimate when there's a line out the door and people are wearing boots and fleece jackets. Bi-Rite creamery has helpful, friendly workers, unique but tasteful flavors, and delicious, quality ice cream to match!   The salted caramel is creamy, rich, and speckled with saltiness throughout.  Sorbet is refreshingly tart. There isn't too much flair about Bi-rite, and the colorful, old fashioned vibe and it's pure quality will undoubtedly keep the lines long. Know Before You Go: 1. While a friend is waiting in line, have another friend scope out one of the few bar stools if you're looking to sit inside! (6 chairs inside!)  There most likely will be a line. 2. Don't be afraid to ask for samples, the employees are kind - but don't take advantage!  Keep it reaaallll. 3. Take a date and share multiple flavors!

So I've decided that Bi-Rite should be giving me a cut of their sales.  I'll take it in ice-cream vouchers if needs be. Seriously, the amount of people I've gotten addicted to their salted caramel ice-cream...well, let's just say it's ALOT. If you're feeling wild and cwazy, the Sam's Sunday is one of the richest, most inventive ever.  Using bergamot olive oil and sea salt, just be prepared to be catapulted to oooh myyyy goddd.  Nuff said.

Unbelievable!!! Bi-Rite brings ice cream to a new level. The flavors are incredibly innovative and the quality is through the roof! Every single flavor is delicious and expertly crafted. There is something new and original there for everyone. How they have eleven 1 star ratings (even out of 1355 total ratings) is beyond crazy. It has to be their competition making jealousy reviews. I don't have anything else to say except if you haven't been there you must go & try it. It will not be hard to fill up your buy 10 get 1 free card.

Line out the door like a club.   9pm, what could possibly be so exciting?!? YOU HAVE TO GET THE SALTED CARAMEL.  PERIOD.  Add a half scoop of Ricanela's (ice cream with snicker doodle cookies).  Sit outside because there's only about 3 seats inside this tiny spot and it's way too noisy to sit inside.   Bi-Rite Creamery owners are geniuses.  Lease a spot near Dolores Park, offer funky flavors, have no seating inside to force everyone to sit outside and make your place look popular, charge $3 a cup, and get rich fast.   I will definitely be back to contribute to their bank accounts.  WOW on the Salted Caramel.

Oh yeah. I'll give this place 5 stars - without a doubt! 1 star = Salted Caramel flavor ice cream. Wow! So tasty, I actually crave it. 2 star = Honey Lavendar flavor ice cream. Definitely their #2 flavor. 3 star = Friendly service. Everyone was super friendly even tho the line was out the door. 4 star = They are open later than most ice cream places. 5 star = I got parking right in front. (Now, this may have been a fluke as it is NEVER that easy to find parking in the area. But the few times I have been here, I have found parking right away and very close! Maybe it's a sign that I need to come back often.)

My buddy and I ended up circling the area because as it turns out, there is NO parking in San Francisco. So three of our friends got out of the car and alas, I had to settle for whatever they brought me. I wound up getting their much talked about Salted Caramel paired with Coconut. The salted caramel was very exciting, it tastes exactly like it sounds ... sweet and salty. The burnt/caramelized sugar flavor was a tad overwhelming, but I still enjoyed it. The coconut was very creamy, very sweet ... but not the best complement to the salted caramel. I didn't really get to know you Bi-Rite ... I didn't even get inside of you ... But I think I loved you.

Salted Caramel Ice Cream - it does live up to the hype.  On first bite, I was a bit surprised by the flavor, but a second taste reassured me that I liked this.   The more bites I took, the more it reminded me of eating the hard crunchy top of a yummy creme brulee.  What I find most interesting is that the ice cream managed to taste like a bite of creme brulee (both the cream part and the burnt sugar top part all rolled into one bite). Yumm.   Also had the Coffee Toffee today. I LOVED the toffee. I really wish there was a bit more of it. And the Coffee taste was really strong but in a good way. It is a quite pricey pint of ice cream ($7.99) and definitely an indulgence unless you've got a bottomless box of cash.  And if you have one, please let me know where I can get one too.

Loved the flavors with malted vanilla being my favorite. Thank god this tasted good because I would have been so pissed to just wait in the cold for mediocre ice cream.  Actually my boy and I split the Trifecta which consisted of malted vanilla, brown butter, and sea salt caramel. I thought the caramel had too much salt and it was just too overpowering.  The other flavors were fantastic.  Loved it. Not as creamy and soft as Humphrey Slocombe, but loved the Trifecta sans salted caramel. Thank you, customers in front of us, for keeping us entertained in the cold!

Visited Bi-Rite because it was highly recommended by my man Ed.  Got the Salted Caramel ice cream and it tasted really good.  I never thought salted caramel could produce such a great taste with ice cream.  It's probably all in the art of the homemade ice cream. I took the metro subway from our hotel room to get to this place and it was well worth the trip.  Highly recommend this place if you enjoy ice cream and are brave enough to try new flavors.  This place will blow your mind away with the amount of different flavors that are served here.

The 4000+ other reviews say it all! A few words of wisdom when coming here... Skip the sometimes ridiculously long lines and head to the freezer inside and grab yourself a pint (or larger) of salted caramel, grab a spoon, pay, and walk over to Delores Park and dig on in. So yea, it's a bit pricey, perhaps a bit gluttonous, but so. darn. good. If you do plan to wait in line for a sundae or something freshly scooped, give Sam's Sundae a whirl. Truly decadent and rich chocolate ice cream, a bright and fruit olive oil, and sea salt are a unique and utterly perfect combination. Oh and the whipped cream is freshly whipped as well. As I write this it is 70 degrees out and what better way to spend an afternoon that with a tub of ice cream in my lap.

I have been lamenting this review... I had very high hopes for Bi-Rite.  I bypassed many other options on my birthday in favor of making the trek to have my birthday sundae at Bi-Rite; how could I go wrong with so many great reviews? I will not say I was disappointed because many things were very good, even great, but it just wasn't what I had expected.  And slow, oh so slow to make our sundaes... Like 10+ minutes... Really? I got the brownie sundae with a scoop (love the very reasonably sized scoops) of ricanelas and a scoop of brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl.  Brownie, fabulous. Ricanelas, very tasty and I could really taste the snickerdoodle.  Brown sugar with caramel swirl, amazing.  Whipped cream on top, wow.  Here's where they lost me... The hot fudge was horrid!  It wasn't fudgy... It was runny... It was thin... It was cold... It was bitter... It had a gnarly aftertaste that makes Walden Farms chocolate syrup taste good (and that, my friends, I have always thought to be impossible).  Because of this it was a complete distraction.  And it was all over the place so there was no artful way to make it go away.   My husband got a banana split but really felt it should be labeled as a bananas foster sundae because all it had was bananas and the unfortunate chocolate crap being passed off as hot fudge, he said he would try it again but with caramel sauce instead. We all agreed that the ice cream itself was worth the trek and the brownie was good enough to stand alone but the sundaes were missing something.  Sorry purists, but what the sundaes here need is a dose of Ghirardelli... Bi-rite ice cream with Ghirardelli chocolate, hot fudge, caramel... Mmmmmmmm, that would be heaven.

We sampled many flavors and ended up with 4 scoops/flavors.  My favorite was.... surprise, surprise.... salted caramel.  I can't even remember the other three.  I actually did not enjoy the icecream there because i went after a huge dinner.  We couldn't finish the icecream, so i took it home and froze it.  I ate the salted caramel a few days later, and omg heaven, it tasted so good.  I recently saw that Safeway has salted caramel icecream, so i'm going to try that and compare it to Bi-Rite.

My ideal sunny summer afternoon (which for SF is peppered throughout the year, and not restricted to June-July-Aug) includes a stop @ Bi-Rite. After your Dolores Park picnic starring one of Ike's famous sandwiches, stroll down 18th toward BART. Skip the inevitably long line-up into the 1st Bi-Rite you see, and instead go nextdoor to the pop-up window, for the limited list, but equally as mouth-watering selection of their famous beat-the-heat treats. Try the brown-butter cookie with coffee ice cream sandwich... and love your life. Enjoy it while taking in the gorgeous street art plastered down the entirety of Clarion Alley off of Mission. Ah, summer in the city.

On the first warmish day during this latest Ice Age, we sat on one of the cute benches outside Bi-Rite enjoying our ice cream cones in the sunshine. Even when my friend pointed out two of the most unsavory sights ever while eating ice cream - on the left, some tore-up fake braid extension possibly lost in a fight between two queens, and on the right, a beagle with a huge hard-on - yeah, even then - that scoop of butter pecan tasted damn good.

I was in the Mission with my newly minted bf...taking in a film at the Frozen Film Fest this past splendid Saturday. Shhh....but of course my secret mission of the day was to seek and find my long-awaited scoop of the Salted Caramel that I've been reading so much about from the local yelpers.   After a slight detour of ending up at the Bi-Rite grocery store...I found it!  And a short line wait later, I completed my mission!!  Mmmmmm.... I was tempted by a brief moment to try some of the other wonderful flavors...like Chai or Honey Lavendar or Balsamic Strawberry.  I would have asked for a taste of all of them if it wasn't for my newly minted bf.  He doesn't quite know how much of a sweet tooth I've got...what a dessert fanatic I am...a cake fiend...shhhh....I'm not ready to divulge this weakness to him yet ;)

So this place has like 1000 reviews that tell you how incredible BiRite is and why you should come here, so why write another review? Because this place is awesome. Even from the line outside (which can get long on nice days), you can smell the creamy goodness that is taking place inside. With flavors of ice cream ranging from Delicious to Exquisite (maybe a maple pecan something or other somewhere in the middle), you'll never be disappointed with their rotating selection of flavors. Go see Andrea while you're there - if you leave grumpy after talking to her, there's no hope for your soul. Oh, there's also plenty of tasty treats you can buy inside from cookies to cakes made from local bakeries. There's really no way you can leave unhappy after walking into BiRite. Unless you're the devil.

It's Indian Summer, is that politically incorrect to say that, in these neck of the woods. Warm weather is expected end of September and October so it's no surprise the lovely weather we've been having. My grandparents live up the street from Bi-Rite but we were raised on Mitchell's Ice Cream. Today we went to visit grandma on her 93rd Birthday, after our visit we headed to Bi-Rite. Parking is a biiiiiiiitch! What with Mission High school right there, Tartine down the street, and Dolores Park too. Circled 2x and managed a space on Guerrero. Thankfully there was NO line at Bi-Rite! I knew what I wanted to try and what my mom would be open to taste. Prices have gone up! AUWE! At least with the single you're not limited to 1 flavor but for $3.25, I want more!!! So I got the Salted Caramel and the Roasted Banana, how could I not? Everyone raved about them here on Yelp! And mom got the toasted coconut and butter pecan. Being a warm day and having to walk back to the car, a block away, melting was occurring. I actually noticed that they seemed soft when the guy was scooping for me. The salted caramel tasted like burnt creme brulee to me. Not bad, but not great either. The roasted banana was more my cup of tea but it needs nuts in it or something, walnuts perhaps? My mom loved both her selections.  I only got a taste of the butter pecan and it tasted like vanilla with raw pecans. Where was the buttery goodness? or pralined nuts? Noticed the cute benches built round the trees out front. And there's some bench like seats built into the building. I can see it being a hit with some, but I guess I'm a self proclaimed Mitchell's loyalist!

Fantastic!  Local friends brought me here on a "short walk," and, apparently from the other reviews, it's a good thing we made it there before 10! Actually, when we got there at 9:30 on a Monday night, we didn't have to wait at all.  They offered up free samples of whatever we wanted to try, but as soon as I had the salted caramel I knew that's what I wanted. A friendly smile & a beautiful friend also got us into the reserved for employees only (wink, wink) restroom, which was nice to have in that kind of non-retail area late at night. The prices aren't cheap, but I was born in the 70s and grew up with Thrifty's ice cream at 15c a scoop, so, I guess since I'm working now I can afford $4 something for 2 scoops of ice cream.

Best ice cream hands down. All I have to say is get the Ricanelas ice cream. It is all about the Ricanelas. Snickerdoodles in cinnamon ice cream, what more could you ask for? It is cold, creamy and great on a cone. Absolutely love their ice cream. I've tried the other flavors as well, but I always leave getting at least one scoop of ricanelas. Worth the wait in line. Get a scoop on a cone and lick to your hearts content as you walk over to dolores park and swing on the swings like you were a kid again. great place to take a date. Great ice cream and great service. love it!

If I could get my fix of bi-rite ice cream through an IV 24/7 I would consider it very very seriously. The flavors are sophisticated and crisp. My faves happen to be the honey lavender and ginger.

So I've lived in SF my entire life, and seen all the ice-cream shops come and go...To my surprise besides Mitchell's Ice Cream and Polly Ann's  I would have to say this is one of the best Ice cream shops in the city.   I love the salted caramel and Roasted Banana. It is the perfect remedy for a desert after a nice dinner in the Valencia or on Mission.   If you come here on a Sunny afternoon expect lines out the door, and be prepared to wait at least 15 mins...but it is definately  worth it.   Make sure you get your frequent buyer card stamped on the way out, cause once you try it, you'll definately be back. This is a very American style flavored ice-cream shop so if your into classic Chocolate, Coffe, and Vanilla flavors...this would be the most ideal place to get it.  But if your looking for something tarty with some fruity flavors check out Polly Ann's...Either way even if your not a fan you will be after your first visit!

Hello deliciousness. Salted Caramel Ice Cream? No way. YES WAY. Everyone who works here is super friendly and helpful.  They give out as many samples as you "need" to decide AND I very much appreciate the (clean) metal spoons for samples as to not waste a million plastic spoons. It's small so a line out the door doesn't mean tooo long of a wait.  Definitely a place to check out.  Get the salted caramel. Do it.  Or the Malt Vanilla with something that I can't remember because my brain stopped forming memories due to intense oral pleasure. (Yay classy reviews!)

Holy crap! This is the your best bet on satiating your sweet tooth in this extreme heat. The line on Sunday wrapped around the corner. I didn't mind because I got a chance to chit chat with those around me. Once in front, I went for the double scoop because I couldn't decide on coffee toffee or the salted caramel flavor. BOTH were delicious. Their texture and ideal sweetness really made my visit to Mission Delores fantabulous!

This place was good.  It was just so creamy, and just slides down your throat.  I got the mint chip, and it was intense!  It tasted like those peppermint candies.  It was good, and had enough chocolate chips to balance it out.  Not too many, not too few.   My bf got the salted caramel, and it was delish!  This place is his favorite ice cream place in the city.   Plus, the people who worked there were super cool.  The guy was so nice and let me try a bunch of flavors since it was my first time at BiRite!   Go here, and love it.  You can't not!

This past weekend I came here twice. On Saturday I waited 15 minutes outside in the boiling hot weather to order a single scoop of honey   lavender ice cream. Apparently, for a single scoop of ice cream you can choose two scoops of flavors but my friend only ordered me two scoops of the honey lavender for $3.25. She herself ordered a scoop of honey lavender and toasted coconut. The honey lavender was too sweet but it has a very strong and aromatic lavender flavored. After eating that I was in desperate need of water to wash the sweetness down. I managed to taste a small nip of my friend's toated coconut and it is excellent. The texture of the ice cream is very creamy and with flakes of toasted coconut that really enhances the flavoring. Best of all it was just right--not too sweet. After the bay to breakers on Sunday, I went again and waited 20 minutes this time to order a single scoop--toasted coconut and balsamic strawberry.  The toasted coconut once again was delicious. The balsamic strawberry is also very tasty with a heavy strawberry flavoring and a little bit of sourness. I ordered the coconut on the bottom and the strawberry on the top of the cup and it was divine. The strawberry really enhances the flavoring of the coconut so neither flavors would overrided the other making it one fabulous combination.

"LEGEN...wait for it, wait for it...and I hope you're not lactose intolerant because the next part of that word is DAIRY.  LEGENDARY!" I'm not a huge ice cream lover.  I don't go to the store to buy ice cream, and I don't really care whether my freezer has ice cream or not.  I'm usually not the one to eat it.  Pretty much the only place I eat ice cream is Ghirardelli when I'm giving someone a tour of SF.  Well, that was until I found out about Bi-Rite Creamery. First time I went I got Cookies N Cream (to be safe) and then Roasted Banana.  Cookies N Cream was almost the same as any other, but when I tried Roasted Banana, OMGWTFBBQBANANA! Heavenly.  I've been to Bi-Rite two other times after that and have always gotten this plus one other flavor.  My friends have started tallying how many people like Roasted Banana vs Salted Caramel.  Can't say I'm a fan of Salted Caramel, but to each his own.  So far, Salted Caramel is winning. The second time I went I tried Honey Lavender with Roasted Banana.  Of course the Roasted Banana was good, but the Honey Lavender was...INTERESTING.  Not bad, but not something I'd like to have again.  It sort of tasted like how I'd imagine Febreeze's lavender aroma would taste. Third time, again Roasted Banana, but the second flavor was Cherry Almond.  IT WAS DELICIOUS.  It really is just almond and cherry flavor mashed into one delicious ice cream.   The service there is also really great.  The servers are always smiling.  I picked up a "Buy 10 get 1 free" card because i know i'll be going there very often.    Parking is a little difficult closer to the weekend.  Weekdays between 9 and 10 it's quite easy to find parking. GO TO BI-RITE.  THEY HAVE AWESOME ICE CREAM. I'm probably going back here tonight haha. EDIT: I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news.  I just found out today that Cherry Almond is a seasonal flavor!  So what with cherries only being available during the summer, it turns out that CHERRY ALMOND IS ONLY AVAILABLE IN JUNE/JULY!  Remember this, mark your calendars for June/July 2010.  GO TO BI-RITE.  MUST TRY CHERRY ALMOND.  Even if that means coming back from your summer vacation in Hawaii or Cancun or whatever. On the other hand, Balsamic Strawberry is delicious.

Yummy yummy in my tummy. Just had my first bi-rite experience and it was a great one. I had a salted caramel cone because it was on 7x7's 100 Foods to Try list. I have to say it was a very interesting flavor, super creamy and the salt side of it kept it from being too sweet. I was also considering the balsamic strawberry and honey lavender. I suppose I will have to go back again :) 5 stars for the really interesting & creative flavors. Minus 1 for line.

I tried the brown sugar icecream as a tasting. Soooo amazing. But we got 3 flavors my brother really likes. I was not a fan of the lavander honey, and the carmel and salt was OK (should have gotten brown sugar). The best was the balsamic strawberry.  Next time I go, I will sample each one before making my selection. I really hated the lavander, esp when it touched the other flavor and I got a taste by mistake. ick!   If you couldn't tell already, there are crazy long lines, so eat your dinner, then head over. By the time you get your icecream, you should have enough space for dessert.

If you like melty ice cream, this is the place for you. I don't know if it's ever firm because both times I've had Bi-Rite ice cream I've been the circle-in-the-car-because-there's-never-anywhere-­to-park person and somehow, between my wingperson walking from the store to the car, the ice cream turns into really delicious, rich, complex soup. I love how spot-on the flavors are (banana tastes like bananas instead of the banana FLAVOR I've come to expect after a youth spent sucking on banana Now-n-Laters), I love that they offer non-traditional flavor combinations (even if this means that they don't offer anything involving peanut butter -- not sure if they just don't or if I've just missed their peanut butter days), and I love that you can get a teeny, tiny kid-sized cup of ice cream because JIMINY CRICKETT, that stuff is rich.

I'm not a huge fan of sweets, but my gf is. So we came here on a random night, and decided on the Salted caramel, and a Sam's Sundae. Sam's sundae may seem a bit weird, chocolate ice cream, sea salt, and olive oil. It doesn't sound entirely appealing but the combination WORKS. You get the smooth velvety chocolate, and the sea salt just enhances and confuses your taste buds, causing them to scream in pleasure. And then you get that fruity taste of olive oil. It's really intense and I'd suggest anyone to try it. The salted caramel is more or less on the same level as Sam's Sundae. The salt just brings out the flavor a bit more, kind of transforms what you normally think of caramel into something different. It's smooth and velvety, and a lot softer than other ice creams, but the reasoning behind that is the high sugar content, go figure. The lavender ice cream is pretty cool too. It's hard to describe but you kind of get a little minty aftertaste.

Yes, I jumped the food network bandwagon and found out about this place on Best Thing I Ever Ate. Had Sam's Sundae and wow. This is a sundae for those with advance palettes and can appreciate new things. The olive oil was citrusy and delicious, and so unlike olive oil that I had to remind myself of what it was a few times. The salt intensified the chocolate ice cream, and the citrus was creamy and unexpected. All around delicious and I can't wait to come back! Then I came back, before I posted this. Salted Caramel. Heaven. I optimistically got a stamp card, and my goal is to fill it up by the end of the year...

Sweet and savory is the new john and yoko. At least bi-rite would have me think so. I tried a sundae made with sea-salt-and-olive-oil-infused chocolate ice cream that absolutely changed my concept of what "delicious" means in the context of experimental ice cream. I've yet to try a flavor that beats the ricanelas, though. Holy cow.

Wow. The best ice cream i've ever had. They have lots of innovative flavors that initially scared me away, but my beautiful gf and i felt adventurous one day and decided to try it out. over a few visits, we've tried roasted banana, toasted coconut, salted caramel, snickerdoodle, and lavender. the banana, coconut, and snickerdoodle are all favorites, but the lavender tastes too much like perfume. The salted caramel is also very good. Would def. go back and recommend to others. I want some now! *nom nom*

The Ricanelas (Cinnamon Ice Cream with Snickerdoodles) was off the hook! Even on the cloudiest day in San Francisco, on the brink of rainfall, there's nothing like a good...cough...there's nothing like a GREAT scoop of ice cream to make your day! Passing  the line divider outside, I felt relieved that it was that easy to get some ice cream, assuming people line up out the door. It was 2 o'clock in the afternoon. There were so many unique choices, but once I took a sample taste of the Ricanelas, the search was over. By the way, right on Bi-Rite Creamery for using actual spoons for samples scoops and helping the environment!

This place does ice cream right (or should I say Bi-Rite!). It is right down the street from Bi-Rite market and easy to find. Parking, however, is difficult. I adore the Earl Grey and Roasted Banana!!! I have tried other flavors and they are good too. There is always a line out the door, but it moves quickly. It's open really late too! So when you are feeling for something sweet after dinner and drinks, head to Bi-Rite! Eat it. Love it. Repeat.

The flavor is very bold however so pair it with something lighter. It going to be a tough call as to which one is better btwn Humphrey's and Bi-Rite. Guess you'll have to make that call yourself.

Let me start by saying that I'm lactose intolerant so I only "tried" some of the regular flavors; and they were all fantastic; especially the much touted salted caramel. I had a small taster cup of their vegan chocolate ice cream which was also very very tasty. Prices are high, and lines are long, but its well worth it!

Took a journey to find some good ice cream today because it was mildly hot. I went with a few friends at around 9pm and as we passed by, there was a line out the door to the corner of the block already. To our surprised, the wait wasn't very long. It resembled Ike's Places' line but went by much quicker. Plus, I got parking right in front today :] I had heard salted caramel was good but I was never a big fan of caramel. I liked how roasted banana sounded so I got that along with Malted Vanilla in a cone. I must say, their roasted banana flavor made me go bananas! It tasted so fresh and I could really taste fresh banana. So GOOD. About $3.25 for a double scoop cone. Very worth it I was always scared of having two scoops on a cone though. That one moment you're too excited to lick and it just falls off. Good thing it didn't happen to me though. Gotta keep your head in the game! *NOTE: my friends both got sundaes and told me the ice cream was good but they add too much chocolate and it minuses points for them lol. Cone or cup should be just fine!

Bi-Rite is all-Rite! Salted caramel: one of the best things you've ever tasted Rincanelas (vanilla? with hint of cinnamon and snickerdoodle pieces inside): maybe the 2nd best thing you've ever tasted. The ice cream here has a great creamy consistency and nothing is too sweet or too bland = perfect! Service was pretty awesome as well; we must have sampled every single flavor, and the lady still had a smile on her face. Best I've had in SF so far!

I LOVE Bi-Rite! I can literally go there everyday, and I did for a month (sometimes twice a day!). Yes I have an obsession. Just thinking about the salted caramel and honey lavender combo is driving me crazy! That is really the best combo, or you can sub honey lavender with earl grey! The salted caramel is sooo good it tastes like the See's Peanut Butter Caramel Brittle Bar (i think that's what it is), but the flavor can become overwhelming and that's when a soft flavor like honey lavender or earl grey can balance it. Brown butter pecan is pretty bomb, the balsamic strawberry, the malted vanilla, omg everything was soooo good. And the watermelon sorbet.  Yea when I first went, I literally tried everything, but I don't think they mind because they were super nice about it; and they give you a silver spoon to try the ice cream with (hooray! for being environmental conscious!). Here's the perfect summer day in SF, if weather permits: -You're going to need a beach towel, a light blanket, a book, magazines, and your ipod. Also bring a game or some form of physical activity. -Grab a sandwich at Ike's (beware lines are super long, get ready for at least a 45 mins (if you're lucky) wait; but trust me it's worth it. -Set up your spot in Dolores Park , eat your sandwich, read your book/magazine and listen to some music.  Take a nap. -Then go to Bi-Rite for ice cream. -Go back to the park, and play some frisbee or football. -Go to one of the many GOOOD restaurants for dinner; then take a stroll. -Finally before leaving, make sure you go back to Bi-rite again!

Noting recent experience and the age of my original review, I think it's time for an update.   A recent visit into the parlor revealed there isn't a new "seasonal sundae" on the menu in quite some time.  The selections were all the same as were the flavors available for the most part.  The ice cream was very good, but not exceptional.  Perhaps it's just there is now some fierce competition in town and my tastes are more subjective now.  It's certainly better than Mitchell's but Humphrey Slocombe tries harder and stays more fresh I think. I also recently tried their new soft serve.  I wasn't super impressed the first time and gave it a second chance to today.  I LOVE soft serve.  Dairy Queen rules.  Sorry Bi-Rate but you don't even rate with dairy queen.  The choco/vanilla twist had very little of either flavor.  It basically tasted like sweet cream which was ok, but I wanted both vanilla flavor and chocolate.   Once again me thinks location, location, location and a sense of take the money and run has gotten the best of what started out to be an outstanding place.  Hate it when that happens.

Bi-rite is always a fun spot to go with friends. I don't think this is the best ice cream I've ever had, but their Honey lavender is one of my favorite. It's really smooth and creamy, with a subtle hint of lavender, and just melts in your mouth. The servers are really nice and always willing to give out samples. If you aren't in the mood to wait in line, there is a take-out window on the side. Definitely give Bi-rite a try if you have never been, it's one of the best ice cream spots in the city!

Maybe it was a bad day, maybe I had a bad day... My first visit to Bi-Rite left me shrugging my shoulders.  I had the Honey Lavender and Salted Caramel.  Driving home, my sweet tooth was hurting and needed satisfying. I first dug my wood spoon into the Honey Lavender... the first thing I thought of was soap.  I tried another spoonful, but couldn't continue.  It did have a nice scent however... 2 stars. A few gulps of water later, my wood spoon found the Salted Caramel.  This is the same Salted Caramel that is on the 7x7 100 must eats.  It certainly was better, and was a good combination of salty and sweet... 4 stars. I was looking for the Earl Grey my Yelp friend Christine C raved about, yet it wasn't on the menu :(

I came here on a random hot hot day and I was in the mission and thought about this place and wanted to go there asap for their ice cream!! When I got there, I think the elementary school nearby just got out because every little kid was their with their mamas. I thought it was cute and people had their bikes and doggies too! Anyways the line was not that long and I really really wanted to try their Earl Grey Tea but they didn't have it that day!! But I got a total of 3 flavors! The salted caramel, balsamic strawberry, and honey lavender. Everyone raved about the Salted Caramel so i had to get it! IT was the BEST out of everything else! As for the Strawberry Balsamic, I liked that I could totally taste the vinegar in there, but it was sweetened enough to taste good! And the honey lavender wasn't anything special, it always tasted like lotion but I still have love for it! Next time I will come back for Earl Grey and more Salted Caramel! But I was kinda disappointed that their scoops were kind of SMALL I wanted more bigger scoops ):

I walked down the street to this place after eating at Pizzeria Delfina for what I heard was some of the BEST ice cream I could get in SF. I was pretty skeptical but decided to go anyways since it was down the street. I am not big on ice cream or desserts in general, but this ice cream was DELISH I got the cookies and cream and my gf got the coffee toffee ice cream. The cookies and cream was perfect, thats the only way I can describe it My gf loves coffee ice cream and said that this place was the best she's had. Those toffee chunks they put in really take it to another level! I would say to go check this place out if you are in the area or if you are craving ice cream!

Bi-Rite Creamery is one of the only super-highly-rated place on Yelp that I don't think is overhyped. You can definitely taste the quality, even with the tiny samples they give you. The staff have always been very pleasant to me; one even brought personalizing the experience to a higher level by saying, "Wow! I dreamt last night of serving a girl wearing a black and white jacket, and here you are, in front of me!" Okay, I'm a sucker for people who try to make a connection with me, even if it's a slightly lame line like that. Brownie points from me :) Their ice cream is so good. It's always a struggle for me to choose just one [or two!] flavors, but I think my favorites are the salted caramel, honey lavender, and mint chip [my favorite flavor in the world]. The boy likes the Riccanela one [the snickerdoodle one] a lot. :P Definitely can taste the difference between this ice cream and mass produced ones. So go visit Bi-Rite if you're in town! Or even if you're not, it's worth a stop by. Line gets long on warm days, but you can sit in the park and enjoy your ice cream :) Oh, parking sucks in this area, though, so might be a bit of a walk. But I mean, that makes your extra calorie-consumption alright, right? (;

I have extensive ice cream eating experience.  They truly do it 'rite' here.  Got the single one scoop of salted caramel and one scoop of coffee.  Caramel flavor was excellent, great texture, and consistency.  Coffee was perhaps the best i've ever had, with intense coffee flavor that came through the creaminess and sweetness.   I'll be back.  This is an easy 5 star. (and the price was reasonable too!)

After spending about 20 minutes searching for parking around Dolores Park, we got into a 15 minute line that was blocked off with the special ropes and everything in the freezing weather.  You would assume it was because we were entering a poppin club or something, but nope-- it was to get ice cream! Bi-Rite has so many amazing flavors, I didn't know where to start!  I tried some salted caramel, the coffee toffee crunch, balsamic strawberry, snickerdoodle, and something else (I'm totally blanking right now) but everything was so wonderful! My only regret:  Not buying some jars of their sauces to go.  Damn me and my guilt (I had just eaten a cow before consuming 2 scoops of ice cream here).

There isn't much to say that 3500 people haven't already. I'll just present an eating sequence that's worked quite well for me. Go to Ike's and get sandwiches. Walk over to Dolores Park and eat them in the sun. Rest/digest for 15 minutes. Walk to Bi-Rite and have Ice-Cream. Go home and sit on the couch for the rest of the day. Chocolate almond fudge, my dear lord.

I'm not going to say anything new here... Bi-Rite is my favorite ice cream shop. The salted caramel is absolutely AMAZING! I like to order the sam's sundae but substitute the chocolate ice cream for the salted caramel. It comes with bergamot olive oil, maldon sea salt, and whipped cream. Okay I know it sounds like I'm telling you to overdose on sodium but I swear it's one of the best things I've ever had.

~*Compostable spoons and cups! How friggin awesome is that!?? I would love to see more businesses have these environmentally friendly products!!!~* Yummy! I got 1 scoop that was 2 flavors: Peanut Butter with fleur de sel nuggets and Cookies and Cream. Mmmmm.  You can have a couple of samples before you decide. Salted Caramel is a big hit but I personally am not so into that one. It tasted a bit too buttery for my taste buds. But, who cares- there is something for everyone.

Words can not describe the incredible deliciousness of Bi-Rite ice cream. I'm positive I'll never encounter another ice creamery better than this joint. It's the epitome of perfection. While I love everything I've tried, I'm currently addicted to plowing through pints of Cookies and Cream. The Malted Vanilla w/Peanut Brittle  comes in at a close second.

I think one of the biggest draws to bi-rite creamery is the unique combination of flavors. The ingredients, of course, are fresh and organic, but I think it's the pairings of these ingredients that make bi-rite a stand out. They aren't the run of the mill flavors you would find at any other ice cream place....I love the balsalmic strawberry, creme fraiche (tastes like tart yogurt) and the ricanela (tastes like horchata!). They also have several other unique flavors such as lavender honey, roasted banana, black cherry almond. All good, but I would taste a few before settling on one....for example, though good at first bite, I definitely could not eat an entire cup of lavender honey. The one downside? Kinda pricey....but what is not in SF?

I finally gave Bi-Rite Creamery a try. I'm on yelp*'s mailing list & seen Jonas "JonasApproved" T.'s review on them...I had to go see what the hype was all about. I think they are okay, not bad. They sure have some unique flavors. I'm use to my safe flavors like Chocolate Chip and Cookies & Cream. This place is located across the street of Dolores Park...so you know it's a guarantee easy money maker.

First time here yesterday and the line was long! But it was worth the wait. It's been forever, since i've been able to have some homemade ice cream with high quality ingredients. The service was very friendly.. which was surprising because even though the line was out the door and around the corner, they seemed to greet every customer with the same energy and eagerness. I had the honey lavender & Roasted Banana. The roasted banana was really good & the honey lavender had a weird first taste.. really florally, but then it got pretty good after the first initial shock of the taste buds. The flavors are definitely unique and I hope to come back soon to try out the rest =)

I'm usually pretty critical of a place when I first try it, but for the first time in a long time, I didn't say anything negative about a place.  Now that has to mean something!  After finishing my single size cup with two flavors, let's just say I couldn't stop talking about how great it was. Don't tell anyone this, but I had previously been stalking Bi-Rite for the last several months.  So when I came in, I pretty much knew from the start what I was going to order.  I knew that I was going to order the Salted Caramel and the Roasted Banana flavors.  But I taste-tested them both just in case (some people complained about the Salted Caramel being salty, but it definitely wasn't!). Both were sooo flavorful and scrumptious.  The Salted Caramel has this burnt taste that's almost indescribable.  My sister said it tasted like coffee, but I didn't think so.  Either way, it was delicious.  The Roasted Banana was perfect.  I think next time I might just get only that flavor.  I was expecting chunks of bananas (which would also be pretty tasty), but instead I got rich, creamy banana-y goodness.  I even saw banana seeds, so it was definitely fresh/natural. Great place!!!! And I followed the advice of other reviewers, who said to   get your ice cream and then go eat it at Dolores Park.  Do it!!  The park was so gorgeous, especially on a nice, sunny day like today.  The rolling hills were amazing and great for people-watching.  I bet they could've held Woodstock there...

I finally tried the icecream here and let me tell you, it definitely lived up to my expectations. Its never fun when places disappoint after hearing all the hype and I was not at all disappointed with my 2 scoops of  deliciousness. Here's how the story went: Once upon a time, it was a warm, sunny Sunday in the mission, and so obviously I thought to myself, this is the perfect day for icecream. Luckily Bi-Rite was only a few blocks away. When I arrived, there was a line out the door, but it moved fairly fast. I decided on a scoop of the salted caramel and honey lavender, because I love anything with lavender! The salted caramel was very good, but the winner of the day for me was definitely the honey lavender. Best.Icecream.Ever. The end.

My friend dragged me here. He told me that he drove by this area many times. And every time, this place always had a very long line coming out from the store and sometimes the line was so long, it wrapped around the block. One day, he finally had a chance to try it and he loved it !    He loved it so much that he had to drag me here so I could try it myself  (considering that I am a big fan for All Kinds of Dessert) and yes, he was right. The ice cream here is amazing - possibly the best one in town.   I tried Roasted Banana, Balsamic Strawberry and Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle (the last one was my favorite). It's so creamy, sweet but not super sweet. I love every bite of it! I will come back and do not mind to stay in the long line again.

After much hype from a good friend, I finally got to try Bi-Rite during my last visit to SF. I opted for the single with pumpkin and salted caramel. AWESOME is all I can say.

I want some more just writing about it right now.

Afterwards we walked down the street to a cafe, and when we walked past Bi-Rite the line was out the door! Workers are friendly, you can sample any ice cream they have that day. Some may think it's an expensive place for ice cream, but if it's good..then who cares?!!

I LOVE their Honey Lavender. Every time I come to SF I have to stop by here to get some. I usually get about 3-4 flavors at a time but nothing every comes close to my love for their Honey Lavender. It's got such a sweet and calming aroma. There's always a line but I've never had to wait more than 15-20 minutes to get my ice cream. The workers are mad cool too. The cool thing is that the Creamery is right across the street from the park so you and your buddies can walk over and enjoy the people watching while licking away your sorrows with the yumminess that is Bi-Rite. Parking is of course a bitch but not impossible to find if you drive through the residential streets. Just be sure to come with a friend who is comfortable parallel parking.

I'm lactose intolerant. Understand what that means for me when I a) love icecream b) dislike the taste of soy c) live around the corner from bi-rite creamery. It means that way too often I suffer stomach cramps because I *need* to consume all the amazing flavours you can get from here. On top of that the price is completely right. I always feel under-charged. I mean - I just purchased a huge amount of oral goodness and I've change from $5!!! I don't want to go into which flavours are best, etc - just accept that you can get anything (especially the salted caramel) and be extremely happy (especially if you had the salted caramel). If I had to recommend one, it would probably tbe the salted caramel.

I discovered this place when I had lost my job and needed some sweet & fattening love. I love this place. It's always a long wait...maybe 30 minutes, but to me the Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl is so so SO worth the wait. It's one of those places where you have to put a lot of thought into whether or not you want two scoops, and if you decide on two scoops, do you get two scoops of your favorite or do you venture out. Then if you venture out, you need to put thought into what you want the last taste & texture to be in your mouth. It's a science with wonderful results. Mmmm. The salted caramel really is delish as well. Yum. Now that I'm working again and not gallavanting all over the Bay Area in unemployed bliss, I don't get to enjoy this as often, but now it's an even more special treat.

The workers here are so goddamn nice! I think I tried half of the flavors they offered because I couldn't decided. I ended up with the Salted Caramel and something with Pecans in it. LOL. The salted caramel was too strong for my liking, but with the pecan ice cream it balanced out the flavored. Definitely 5 stars worthy. Awesome customer service and unique delicious flavors. I'll be coming back when I'm near Dolores park again.

Hmm, solid 3.5 stars. Came here with my moo cow! She stood in line while I went to park my car, which is a great strategy!!! By the time I got back to the creamery (10 minutes later), we were almost up at the front.   Sorry to burst your bubbles, but I had a scoop of the salted caramel and honey lavender, and I thought it was just "okay." IMO, their scoops were fairly small. I honestly prefer the salted caramel over the honey lavender. The honey lavender was not honey enough and all i tasted was the lavender. I will give it another update when I come back here to try some more of their other flavors.

Came here for ice cream since... I've never been here and yet I seem to always drive by it and see a large crowd. So I went with some friends and waited for about 10-15 minutes... not too bad especially since I was still full from dinner. I tried two flavors, which was the salted caramel and the lavender flavor. I'm not sure if I'm not a caramel fan or maybe just not bi-rites version... but I really didn't care too much for that flavor... even though everyone seems to go ape shit for that flavor. A little too sweet for me and I didn't even taste the salt to contrast the caramel flavor, so I just felt like I was eating spoonfuls of sugar. However, the lavender flavor was actually my favorite. I know, when you're thinking of lavender... you're probably thinking of soap flavor. It didn't and it was pretty good. Next time, I'll get the lavender and some other flavors people suggest. I tried my other friends flavors and I dont remember what they each got, but those flavors were decent as well.

I'm not usually a fan of ice cream, but I tried their salted caramel ice cream here and I loved it. I like that it's more creamy than icy. And they have a bunch of other unique and interesting flavors. The staff is super upbeat and nice, too. Definitely an SF treasure.

The weight I've lost in the past two months will be back on in maybe two weeks or maybe a week if I get a chance to come here every night after dinner. My friend and I swung by one night and I didn't believe her when she told me there is a line around the corner. I mean what place has a line at night in the cold in San Francisco for ICE CREAM and why haven't I heard of this place before? I wish they had a menu going around earlier because I didn't know what to choose when it was my turn to order so I basically ordered on a whim, salted caramel and cookie & cream. It was delicious!

Tremendous variety of flavors to choose from, you just have to go with the ice cream.  The line looks a little daunting at first but there's usually a reason why there's a line with people willing The flavors that I liked the best were coffee toffee and the salted caramel. The balsamic strawberry isn't too different from the standard strawberry (it's good, but nothing special).  They switch flavors occasionally from what I hear so you gotta stop in to try the new flavors. Also, try the cookies and other goods that they sell once you enter the doors. They're tasty as well. Would definitely recommend swinging by the shop if you're in the area or even on vacation in SF (as I was)

Note to self: next time get a cup and not a cone otherwise your ice cream will melt all over your hand and you will be really sad. Note to self again: get the salted caramel and brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl, but maybe pair it with something light and refreshing like honey lavender or balsamic strawberry. Good stuff!  The consistency and texture of the ice cream is so creamy and rich, it MELTS in your mouth (...even though ice cream literally melts in your mouth).  There's no other way to describe it. Only bummer was that my ice cream was melting so fast on me, I couldn't savor it and really enjoy it like I wanted to.

New place, new dining room table, thought I'd initiate it with a lovely homecooked dinner for me & my BF. First, a late morning shopping orgy at Bi-Rite market (does anyone else spend $100 just walking in?), then across the street thinking to pick up dessert. We were early but figured it was worth waiting outside for 10-15 minutes for the place to open.  Nice that the guy didn't mind how we were hovering and staring and drooling. Salted caramel... worth waiting 10 YEARS for.  Perhaps the best ice cream flavor EVER.   How do I buy the 5 gallon bucket?? Balsamic strawberry... a nice strawberry ice cream but um... at risk of incurring the wrath of Yelp... where's the balsamic part?   I think all other flavors will be ugly stepsisters to the Cinderella of Salted Caramel, but I'm going to have fun tasting them all to prove it.

The 5 of us wanted to end the evening right after a wonderful weekend in SF and Marin. We drove to SF and Disha and I lined up for 20 minutes in the freezing cold to get 4 sundaes from Bi Rite. It was well worth it and absolutely was perfect. We ordered: one banana split with brown sugar and salted caramel ice cream for Ruchi with almonds, whip and a little fudge Disha and Mike got the vanilla, salted caramel with extra fudge whip and almonds I got the salted caramel, brown sugar with a little fudge, extra whip and almonds. I couldn't finish the ice cream and I was full. Everyone else polished their sundaes off like prized pigs at the county fair. This is a winner everytime and the staff working their have high energy and give good portions. Favorites: Salted Caramel and Brown sugar swirl...

The one thing worse than the long line is looking for parking.  Today we came during the day, and surprisingly it took less than  5 minutes from the time we checked out the daily flavors menu to the time I took a first lick of that ice cream.  But not surprisingly, parking took more than 20 minutes.   We each got a single size, for a total of 4 flavors. HONEY LAVENDER---amazing lavender infused flavor that's not too sweet!  My favorite! SALTED CARAMEL---didn't know that salt can bring out the flavor of the caramel so flawlessly. CREME FRAICHE---good but just like the regular yogurt flavor from Nubi. BALSAMIC STRAWBERRY---good but I was expecting something much more different than what tasted like regular strawberry ice cream. * Stamp card * Friendly staff * Benches out side * Soft serve and bakery serving cup cakes next door! * Very difficult to find parking day and night.

Was really excited about this place until I got there. The guy behind the counter was a bit rude.. not just to me but to everyone.. short and snippy.

I grew up loving plain ol' vanilla ... and orange sherbert .. and I like my ice cream super creamy, which wasn't the case with my orange cardamom ... the almond toffee topping was fantastic though, just crumbled in your mouth .. same goes for the cone itself ... ice cream is like pizza .. we all have our own favorites, and no place is unanimously good or bad ... I prefer Mitchell's myself.

this place is worth a visit because of the unique flavors it offers.  i tried out the coffee toffee (really delicious) and something else that wasn't so awesome.  The texture isn't the best though unless you're a big fan of the homemade style.   anyway, the line looks daunting, but it moves pretty quickly.  =)

When there's ALWAYS a line out the door down the street, you know it's gotta be a good place. (Don't worry, I think the line moves pretty fast) They ran out of Salted Caramel and Ritual Coffee Toffee (kinda funny cuz we had just walked over from Ritual Coffee), so I ordered Honey Lavender and the Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate (wow that was a mouthful). The Malted Vanilla was definitely my favorite - SO AMAZING! I taste-tested Balsamic Strawberry (what a weird concept!) and found it to be pretty good as well, but not good enough to order. And although one of my friends really liked Ginger, I wasn't too wild about it. I got the single scoop (2 flavors) in a cup and couldn't finish it...but then again I just had 3 tacos beforehand so maybe that's not too surprising.

GOOD! SO GOOD! SOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOD!!! did i make my point? Yes, this place has a line out the door on any given night and you can count on it if its the weekend. But it's definitely worth the wait if you really want ice cream, or something sweet after dinner. Their ice cream are all homemade so i don't think you can find these flavors anywhere else. I actually came here 2 days in a row because I had to get my hands on the other flavors! :P The Almond Joy Sundae is a good choice if you're into coconut, almonds, and chocolate. If you're choosing by the scoops, one scoop of the roasted banana and one scoop of the honey lavender is a great combo. Staffs are friendly and energetic, it made the environment fun! Ice cream and enjoying it right outside on the benches at night sets the evening right.

OMG. FREAKING AMAZING. It made me wonder what I've been eating all these years. Inferior ice cream! But quality, organic goodness comes at a steep price. I had two scoops, one salted caramel and the other was ginger. HEAVEN! drooool. Loved it so much I had to buy two pints for home. TWO PINTS FOR 16 BUCKS. Ouch. Thank god I don't live around the area because I'd be too fat to fit my skinny jeans and too broke to buy new ones.

Just leaving SF, headed home back to Baltimore and I'm finding myself already missing Bi-Rite ice cream...hmph.  The Bi-Rite market and its creamery counterpart know quality ingredients, products, friendly service and how to get a line moving quickly.  Yes, on a hot day (and often on a cool night) you will find a line wrapping around the street corner, but don't let that sway you. Clearly this massive appeal is due to the completely lovely and unique ice cream offered here.  Yesterday, I enjoyed Honey Lavender and Creme Fraiche in a cone, and it was as always, wonderfully creamy and flavored well.  You will find a flavor that you enjoy here, ask for a sample at the counter if you find yourself leery of a potential flavor, they will happily oblige.

I came here and the store was packed! A line was formed outside to the corner of the street. Very busy but they know how to get through everyone friendly and quick. I really wished I remember what I ordered... Something with Coconut and probably butter pecan? Whatever it was, it was still great! My friends tried the salted caramel, honey lavendar and other flavors, too... But whatever they got, they thought it was great and yummy nonetheless. :) Service was nice and organized. Store was clean. That's a good thing, because ice cream gets really messy and when it's messy, it really stinks. It's like the mildew or rotten food kind of smell. They make cakes, too! I didn't see any though. :\ I would definitely come back again if I had the chance.

I don't know if there is anything I can add to this that hasn't already been said! With over 1800+ reviews and an average of 4.5 stars, I think Bi-Rite speaks for itself. Check out this place in SF-- you won't regret it! Came here on a Friday night and saw the line outside the door and around the corner, but was happy to find out it moves along rather quickly. With flavors like roasted banana, balsamic strawberry, and brown sugar with ginger, what's not to love?! I got the balsamic strawberry and honey lavender-- the strawberry was sweet and very flavorful, and the honey lavender was absolutely yummy. Light, sweet, fluffy, with a hint of lavender-- perfect! As a college student in Berkeley who's tried Ici many times, this is my new favorite ice cream in the Bay Area. The flavors are just much more strong and flavorful at Bi-Rite. If Bi-Rite could improve in any one aspect, it would be their ice cream cones-- Ici's chocolate tip kills the competition.

Over 2000+ reviews --  what more could I possibly add?  With that in mind, here's the short & sweet review: MUST HAVE: -roasted banana -salted caramel -honey lavender -toasted coconut * I recommend mixing the roasted banana & toasted coconut -- a roasted & toasted combo! BUYER BEWARE: -the line can get ridiculously long.  At 4pm on a Sunday afternoon, the line wrapped around the block. The line moves swiftly, though, and your patience is greatly rewarded.   -if you're picking up a pre-ordered cake or a pre-packaged pint, step right on in, no need to wait! -sample away! The staff is more than willing & able to let you sample all of the delicious concoctions before your make a final decision. STAFF: -friendly, awesome, upbeat -tendency to sing along to the music that gets you groovin' (I think they were playing Janet Jackson's greatest hits the last time we were there. "I miss you muuuch!") OVERALL: The ice cream is made with fresh, quality ingredients and it shows.  My addiction has grown with every lick and mouthful. ;D

Thanks to Lori K., I've been here twice, and both times I really enjoyed my ice cream. It's a cute shop that always seems to have a line out the door. Luckily you don't have to wait too long before getting your ice cream. I like how they sell unusual flavors. I recommend the ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodle), orange cardamon, and peppermint. I also love the biodegradable cups and spoons!

My first visit to Bi-Rite Creamery happened to be on a rare, warm SF Sunday.  When I saw the throngs of people in Dolores Park, I knew I'd have to wait in a long line for my ice cream.  It was worth the wait, however. Our group tried several flavors, including Ricanelas, Chocolate, Salted Caramel, and Roasted Banana.  The banana was my favorite by far.  I guess it's the "roasting" that makes it so special. I appreciate Jimmy N's comment (below) about buying pints at the market down the street.  If I know what I want beforehand, I will go there and save a lot of time.

To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of ice cream. But Bi-Rite definitely has done something right. There's always a huge line out the door, and when you FINALLY get into the shop, cute vintage-style items are neatly lined in display (including their sugarcane cola). They use REAL spoons to let you taste whatever your heart desires. Their salted caramel is delicious... perfect amount of saltiness and sweetness. I actually really liked their Earl Grey... kind of like an English twist on the green tea. But my heart goes to mint chip... your good ol' fashioned mint chip with refreshing mint and the perfect bitter-sweet chocolate combination. Last time I had it, it was a sunny Sunday afternoon after lounging at the nearby park. Perfect.

I'm not completely impressed with this place. It is over-hyped for me. I give it 3.5 stars. Monday night 9:30pm and there's a line! How is that possible? But yes, I waited since I was already there. So I made the best of it by tasting a lot of flavors: - Balsamic Strawberry (the favorite of the set, it was a creamy strawberry. didn't really taste the tang of balsamic) - Salted Caramel (bleh. didn't like this one despite the knowing what it is.) - Honey Lavender (this was nice but i don't like lavender) - Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces (a little too sweet) A small cup gets you 1 to 2 flavors. A middle size cup gets you 2-3 flavors. And so on. I ended up not liking really any one flavor. Very sad, so I randomly picked 2 for my cup of $3.25 or something like that amount. Deflated, I took my cup of sweet cream, with brown wooden paddle as spoon and sat by the bench around the tree to eat it. I will say the texture of the ice cream is super creamy and smooth, rich with fat and little overrun (that means air). So to that I say 'yum' but the flavors didn't do it for me. I'd rather go to Marco Polo for black sesame.

"I wish I were sitting in Dolores Park right now eating a Bi-Rite Creamery cone," I keep saying to my boyfriend now that we're back in Atlanta. When we hit up this Mission hot spot, the line was out the door, wrapped around the sidewalk. All the flavors looked enticing, but the wait gave me enough time to decide on two scoops to pack into my cone: honey lavender and salted caramel. Despite my usual distaste of lavender flavoring in my beverages or food, I loved its faintness in my heavenly scoop. The salted caramel tasted like a graham cracker. I kind of wish I had tried the balsamic strawberry instead. I also found the bathroom key charming: one of the staff members brought it to me attached to a whisk. I tried to eat a bowl of Mayfield yesterday and accidentally screamed Bi-Rite's name instead. Now I can never eat inferior ice cream again!

Bi-Rite is one of the crazy popular places to get dessert in SF and there is usually a long line that snakes its way outside and around the corner, even on the chilliest of nights.  They're most famous for their salted caramel flavor so you know I had to put it to the test. Once I got into the shop and tried some of their unique flavor combinations, I had to go absolutely sick and ordered 3 scoops.  The first was obviously the salted caramel, but I followed that up with the brown sugar with ginger swirl as well as the ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles).  Let me just say...wow!  All three flavors were absolutely great, with the standout being the superstar salted caramel.  It wasn't overly sweet and the saltiness was extremely subtle, but there was a very special balance of flavors that you've got to taste to understand.  The brown sugar and cinnamon flavors were also phenomenal and the flavors were so well balanced with their accompanying combinations. While I didn't totally dig some of the flavors in the case, they simply weren't for me.  However, the choices I did make were soooo good, and I can totally see why people are willing to stand out in the cold to score a scoop or two.  There is seating outside where you can hang with your dog (the whole neighborhood is pet-friendly) and I highly recommend bring them to keep you company in line.  The Mission has some really cool eateries, and none more cool than the cold scoop of their famous salted caramel. Food: 10/10 Service: 9/10 Price: $ Atmosphere: 9/10

Lawls we went to Bi-Rite Market instead of the icecream store.  Wandered around the grocery store for 5 minutes before realizing it.  Such brilliance. For those of you who don't know, Bi-Rite is one of those hot spots highlighted on Food Network's "Best Thing I Ever Ate."  As expected from a famous ice cream parlor, there was a familiar line of customers out the door.  Such a unique selection of flavors and sundae creations!  I was overwhelmed.  Thankfully, I was allowed to sample to my heart's delight.   SALTED CARAMEL.  Get itt. Decision time? Bi-Rite's seasonal sundae was the peach cobbler sundae when I went and it was delish!!  Two scoops of peach ice cream, graham crackers, whipped cream, syrup. Even on a chilly evening, this sundae hit the spot.  I was pleased, but sad that the sundae cost $6+ and disappeared so quickly.

Salted Caramel.  Salted Caramel.  Salted Caramel. Came on a Saturday afternoon after having brunch nearby.  Had to wait in line for about 35 minutes, which isn't really that bad.  I got to sample about 5 different kind of flavors before settling on Salted Caramel and the Strawberry Balsamic. The Salted Caramel is just.... magical.  Nothing really beat the salty and sweet and that toasted flavors from the caramel.... GAH I'm drooling.  The ice cream itself isn't too soft or too frozen.  As for the Strawberry Balsamic, don't worry, it's not gonna taste like vinegar.  In fact, the balsamic probably enhanced the strawberry flavor.  You can't really taste balsamic, but it was just so good.  If you think Haagen Daaz strawberry is good, Bi-Rite's destroys it. Sampled the Honey Lavender... didn't really care for it since I'm not that huge of a fan of lavender but my friends loved it.  The snickerdoodle is a must for peanut butter fans. You can choose to have a sundae made, order an ice cream sandwich, or even get Salted Caramel frozen yogurt at the separate window (with way shorter line). It's about $3.50 for a small.  Little expensive but trust, it is way worth it.  If you want to buy a pint or a quart, you can skip the line!  So if you have a big group, just get Salted Caramel pint size and have the time of your life! Again, Salted Caramel.  Just do it.

Okay, so when I first had their ice cream (a combination of coffee, creme fraiche, and malted vanilla) I had mixed feelings. The coffee and creme fraiche were okay -- definitely not worth the line when push came to shove. However, that malted vanilla -- that I would (and did) wait in the long line for. Unfortunately, this was before I had tried Humphrey Slocombe's tahitian vanilla. Because the game changed completely after that experience. When I went back to Bi-Rite's for their malted vanilla, I was shockingly underwhelmed and disappointed. Nothing would ever be as good as Humphrey's. In conclusion, this place is worth a three. But only if your virgin tongue has not touched Humphrey's. Otherwise, the long lines and the overratedness of the place knock it down to two. Just go to Humphrey's already.

No wonder Bi-Rite is such a popular spot, their ice cream is delicious! I had their coffee toffee - that's some serious coffee!  I crave it now.  (note: I would not advise to eat this after dinner like I did, you'll be tossing and turning all night from the caffeine!) I also recommend just getting their scoops of ice cream rather than the sundaes - too much toppings. I hear their ice cream might have been creamier before, but I personally love it the way it is now.  Too much cream can be too heavy for me.

Bi-Rite Creamery has the most wonderful sundaes!  We hit up BRC on a visit to SF, after seeing it featured on "The Best Thing I Ever Ate."  Their ice cream is heavenly and definitely worthy of such a title!   Their wide variety of ice cream and sorbet flavors all looked fantastic, I wish I could've sampled more.  I decided on the toasted coconut sundae, which was completely wonderful!  I'm pretty sure I can call it the best sundae I've ever had.  My sister had a brownie and fudge sundae which was sooo decadent.  I would recommend this place the anyone and everyone!   It's small inside and there's a queue line set up outside, so I can imagine that it gets pretty busy.  That wouldn't stop me, though, rain or shine! It's definitely worth it.

Only in SF would you find people lining up in some cold, windy weather to get some ice cream. There's a definite reason to! Salted caramel ice cream. This stuff is the BOMB-BETA ISHNESS. As a kid, I used to hold marshmallows over the flame on a stove to burn it up a bit. The skin that was burnt from the flame used to slide off the marshmallow and be a sugary, burnt flavor. That flavor is this salted caramel ice cream. I bought a double scoop. Who's counting calories? Ha. Not today. I also bought a pint. My husband never complains about this booty. Ha. I am truly a fan. Dear Mitchell's, I'm sorry, I've known you since a kid, but I think I'm moving on to better things. I love you, but I love Bi-Rite more.

I've been here atleast 20 times now.  The lines can be quite scary, but if you are with people you like, it's worth the wait.  If you're on a date with a dud, skip the line, go right into the store, pay for a pint, say bye to your date, and enjoy your pint on your couch in your pjs.   My favorite 3: (though you really can't go wrong with any flavor...) Salted caramel: you've got to be in a sweet mood. It's very sweet, and very salty.  It's great to see a place that does salted caramel flavor when you can actually taste the salt! Who would have thought.. Ginger caramel swirl: When you want salted caramel but want it to on a lower flavor profile.  For those who can't take the punch-in-your-face flavor from the salted caramel, I direct them here.  The ginger isn't that strong here so you don't need to be afraid. Vanilla:  I was never a vanilla girl till bi-rite.  As my friend has stated, 'you can taste the happy cows'.  The depth of the cream in the taste is so transparent in this flavor, you know why people wait in 30 minute lines for this and not for breyers. Even if you don't like vanilla you've got to try it! Oh, and if you like caramel get the ones that are staring right at you while you're checking out.  It's $2each but it's well worth it.  Sometimes it's goat and other times it's not.. so watch what type you grab!

Salted Caramel. The most amazing ice cream I've ever tasted. Ohhhh yes, better than Mitchell's or Cold Stone or whatever other popular ice cream place there is. Bi-Rite got it Right. Ok so honey lavender is pretty good too... and peanut butter and all the other flavors. Not to mention the toppings. Extra points for being green. But really, it's all about the Salted Caramel.

The place generated such a buzz during the day that I just had to make a stop before I left S.F.   It was fairly quiet at night, with only two other patrons in the store.  I had time to ogle at the glass case and eat some samples before settling on a single scoop of half balsamic strawberry and salt caramel. The portion was extremely generous. The creamy texture of the salt caramel became more pronounced as I worked through it, and the flavor was just okay.  However, the balsamic strawberry was a delicious treat of strawberry base and inkling of balsamic flavors. I really want to try the sundaes next time I'm in town.

First you must know, ice cream is one of my favorite treats on this planet.  I think I might add another piece of "should I date this man" criteria to the list:  Do you love ice cream?  If not, we have a problem.  Bi-Rite is a San Franciscan company located in the heart of the mission district.  It doesn't matter if you just ate the biggest dinner of your life and are stuffed to the gills already, or if you hadn't yet eaten dinner and are afraid to spoil your appetite!  Who cares?  Bi-Rite needs to be had, and now.  The ice cream flavors are unique with flavors like ginger (a much coveted flavor by locals come to find out, as it usually sells out mid to late day), salted caramel, and lavender.  They also carry homemade cookies - I picked up some toffee chocolate chip to bring back to Chicago with me.   I skipped all the way back to my pals apartment with my Bi-Rite ice cream in tote, then savored it to the max on my blow up mattress the last night of vacation. Happy birthday to me.

IT'S OK... I've been hearing all the raves about "weird" ice cream called salted caramel, so i did some research and found Bi Rite Creamery with 4.5 stars average.. WOW that is very impressive, its a MUST to try this place out. so we did, and luckily there's no line. anyways, the cashiers were really nice, and introduced us to some popular flavors. the bf ordered Earl Grey - OK Roasted Bananas - tasted just like banana Honey Lavender - no thanks first off.. honey lavender is gross. unless you like eating soap or perfume. it smelled good, like a scented bathroom at a spa, but i didn't like it at all. (that's why i didn't order it ) i got the SALTED CARAMEL - too sweet for my taste TOFFEE COFFEE - OK tasted like coffee RANCHINELAS (uh i forgot how u spell that) - its good. when i first tried salted caramel, it was pretty good. salty and sweet.. but when it was in the same cone as the toffee coffee, i couldn't tell the difference between them anymore. both of them almost tasted the same, or maybe i could no longer taste the salt because of all the sweetness in the rest of the ice cream. don't take me wrong, i will come back... just not as often and definitely not going to waste my time driving across the city/look for parking and wait in ridiculously long line for this.

As with my other reviews, this one is for the sake of Yelp profile completeness, because as you can see, this place really doesn't need anymore reviews.  And if 3000+ reviews can't convince you to come here then my review probably won't either..!  Anyway... I'm rounding up, because I think I would say 4.5 stars, but I think that's only because the standard in my mind is Scoops in LA, and I have yet to find a place that measures up with the flavors / taste AND the price. That being said, I think Bi Rite does an awesome job with flavor.  Tasted salted caramel and honey lavendar (YUMMM) and ended up getting pumpkin (I get pumpkin cravings) and the snicker doodle.  Everything tasted exactly as it sounds, and was super YUMMY!!   So the only negative thing is.... it's not $2 for two scoops (like it is in LA..!) and the flavors don't change up as regularly as they do at Scoops. BUT that being said, the ice cream here is very yummy and I would come back the next time I'm in SF!

God bless the Food Network! Without them I may have never stumbled upon this haven of creamy confection. It's been months since I've stopped by but on a random Monday afternoon the line was still, (and always has been) out the door. Somehow I didn't mind. And I never do because it's well worth the wait everytime. At Bi-Rite the ice-cream is made in small batches, the ingredients are organic and all their packaging is biodegradable. So you can enjoy a cold treat and do something good for the environment. *smile* What'll keep you coming back though, are the flavors of ice-cream. Who wants cookies n' cream (although hey they do have it if that's really your thing) when you can indulge in flavors such as Salted Caramel, Toasted coconut, or my new favorite: Brown sugar (that's me) w/ginger caramel swirl.  Flavors change daily so you can always find something new to tickle your palette. Ice-cream not really your thing? Popsicle and ice-cream sandwich lovers they have what you're looking for too. They even serve up cupcakes and cookies. Basically, you have no reason not to stop by and try something. And with summer right around the corner it's best to get a taste before that hot weather brings everyone in line.

Salted Caramel. Salted Caramel. Salted Caramel. The brown sugar with the ginger caramel swirl was pretty stellar as well, but at least every other person who walked out the door while we were waiting in line walked out with - yup, you guessed it - Salted Caramel. But whatever you choose, you'll be getting some of the most inexplicably smooth and creamy ice cream out there, with a ridiculous selection of not just ANY flavours, but INTERESTING flavours at that.  Good thing I didn't put up too much of a fight when Deanna L. told me that yes, Bi-Rite IS worth waiting for, even if there's a line up to 15 people deep.

Salt caramel bliss! This is a must taste, and it is delicious. However, in the spirit of excess, on our 2nd tasting, we brought a pint home, and proceeded to drizzle fresh caramel brought back from Brittany onto the ice cream, then garnished with yes, more sea salt. Divine. And while I am so happy to have this chilly outpost in the neighborhood, I must toot my own horn and proclaim that my homemade salt caramel ice cream (using Straus products and other organic ingredients of course) adapted from a NY Times Magazine article, is just a teensy bit better. But since I won't be selling it to you by the pint, you'll just have to mosey over to BRC for a scoop. The other flavors are all so good it is hard to choose. The roasted banana ice cream is so good - as is the chocolate made with Schokinag brand chocolate. Bring it on. The house made toffee is just that little slice of heaven. Ok, if you have been to Paris and sampled the amazing Berthillon salted caramel ice cream, you really have been to heaven. No doubt I think with Straus' quality milk and cream BRC have nearly reached perfection (minus Eiffel Tower). (I wish they would do soft serve too - hint hint!)

I love their ice cream! I think devouring their ice cream can be my next specialty. Honey Lavendar and salted caramel all the way.... If it's your first time, you might be a bit skeptical about the flavor, but once you try it it's a match made in heaven.  Guarantee. It's just undescribable. Btw--- Hopefully your trip to Bi- Rite won't include a 15-20 min wait like all my other trips there.

Bi-Rite still has it goin' on. I snagged myself a pintful of Salted Caramel ice cream. What a lovely little dessert to have stashed in my freezer after a crazy day at work or a blazing hot day in the city. I learned 2 new things about Bi-Rite, thanks to the friendly staff: 1) They have popsicles available for when you're in the mood for something simple to cool you down. 2) If you're grabbin' a pint, all you have to do is pull it from their freezer and go straight to the front of the line. Can't wait to grab me a spoonful!

This is a place where diets go to die. Bi-Rite Creamery has the most delicious and innovative flavours. Their ice cream's texture is perfect as well. Their staff always serves with a smile, despite the often obnoxious crowd barking orders at them. And if you ask nicely, they'll give you as many tastes as you'd like. The only downside are the long waits on a sunny afternoon and the occasional spoilt brat waiting in the queue. However, the honey lavender more than makes up for these drawbacks. And frankly, for another scoop of their brown sugar, I'd buy pants a size larger any day. Go. Eat. Enjoy.

Sure, the Salted Caramel is amazing but people, try the BROWN SUGAR. My mind is blown. Love the usuals still: cookies n cream, honey lavender, ricanelas, etc but seriously BROWN SUGAR (not to be confused with brown butter pecan). I usually get the single cup which comes with 2 flavors. It is a bit on the small side but with me gaining some pounds lately, it's probably a good thing. Don't let the line scare you away, it goes fast (unless a-holes like me are trying about 5 different flavors).

I like how they don't have a limit to the amt of flavors you can try, and how they're generous about it (unlike Ici). I got the Ricanelas with the Brownsugar with ginger caramel swirl. I definitely tried a BUNCH of other flavors and they were ALL good.  Went in with friends, we all tried different flavors and shared the spoons. LOL. What I love about places like these are the abundant yet not over the top scoops of ice cream, the creaminess, the trust that it's not full of chemicals, and their fair attempts (but not super over the top) at being green. I definitely wouldn't cross a bridge to get this, but if I'm in the area, and with a good friend or friends, I definitely don't mind finding parking and waiting in the cold SF weather to eat the ice cream. PS: my friends loved Sam's Sundae. which has a super cool idea.. but.... I HATED IT! haha.  I kept on trying it too b/c i thought i was an epicure. Maybe they should've used salted whipped cream instead of just adding salt to the ice cream. blegh blegh blegh.

The only downside of going here is that there are too many mouth-watering options so making a decision is very difficult. This was my first visit and it lived up to the hype and then some. I went with the Salted Caramel and the Cinnamon/Snickerdoodle (forget the official name) and I was in sweet tooth heaven. I will definitely be back!

I guess I know where I'll be making regular stops along with my visits to Dolores Park this year - Bi-Rite Creamery has got the goods for ice cream lovers.  Very creamy - delicious ginger, roasted banana and coffee toffee.  I tried 16th Street Honey something, and it was so-so ... but still had a great, creamy flavor. This place is pretty close to the corner of 18th and Dolores .... don't bother wandering down towards the Bi-Rite Market cuz the creamery is on the opposite side of the street and much closer to Dolores than the market. see you at the park with our fabulous Bi-Rite Creamery desserts this summer/fall! :)

Only Bi-Rite Ice Cream would make me trek halfway across The City, get off the elusive beast known as the J-Church, run through Dolores Park at night for a fix of Salted Caramel!  And the cool folks even packed my single scoop of Vanilla Malt in a pint container for the run to the J that I had to make to get home. All of the ice cream flavors here are tremendous. I haven't tried any of the soy creams, but after reading some of the posts here I will have to get them a shot.   So, what makes this place so sweet? Let' see: 1. Organic ice cream made here in SF 2. Local ingredients 3. Sustainable business practices (yes, BRC uses metal tasting spoons) 4. Great toppings 5. Sick toppings (Biscotti anyone?) 5 for 5 baby! I can see no reason to not give BRC 5 stars. Ok, so it doesn't have the menagerie of tropical flavors that Mitchell's' has but hey, do they feature organic ice cream? I didn't think so.  Anyways, Mitchell's' and Bi-Rite Creamery are entirely different genres of ice cream, in an "old school vs. new school" way.

This place certainly deserves 4 stars for reputation alone, and the ice cream is indeed to die for. But unlike Mitchell's, it's equally legendary counterpart, Bi-Rite Creamery's line system is a mess. I can't count the number of times people have outright cut in front of me while I was standing RIGHT THERE waiting for the cashier. Personally, I don't think the shop's compact size is the culprit. Order can be introduced if you worked hard at it enough. One of those number-ticket things, ala a barber shop or Mitchell's, would really help. Some of the people behind the counter are friendly, even energetic. Sometimes, however, they barely look me in the eye when my order's being taken. I feel like I'm being processed, or worse, a distraction along the way of me forking over my cash. Best to end on a positive note: Bi-Rite Creamery, in addition to an impressive palette of flavors, also has some yummy cookies. And unlike Mitchell's, there's plenty of seats to enjoy your treat (treats, even?) outside.

Oh my goodness gracious...if it wasn't for all of the fantastic yelpers out there, I would've never heard about this place and wouldn't of had the honor to try the salted caramel ice cream.....MMMMMMMMMMM So I finally had the chance to try it today and also the balsamic strawberry and ginger ice cream. There was a guy ahead of me who told me that the ginger/caramel combo goes very well, and you know know what? he was darn right! Luckily, I wasn't there when it was crowded and the guy who was helping me was awesome. Me thinks I'm gonna have to stop by there again. I wish I could buy a pint, but since I live about more than 20 minutes away, it probably would be melted....sigh. oh well, i'll so be going there more often!

Hot weekend in SF and this is a "must stop" location.....with a long quick moving line, of course. The unique selection is what makes this place so special. They are all good......I've tried the Salted Caramel, Honey Lavender and Ginger but my favorite is Brown Butter Pecan.   A single scoop for $2.95 gives you an option of 1-2 different flavor(s). Location is kitty corner to Dolores Park so migrate there afterwards to soak up some sun on the grass.

The line says it all. The sundaes are a little on the expensive side, but when it's that good, you just don't give a fig. We stood in a line that weaved it's way round the corner for a good 20 minutes - the day was a hot one, but oh lord. getting to the front, everyone is just in such a good mood. It definitely helps that the guys behind the counter are terribly cute. I love that they have cool interesting flavours. I made my own sundae, something I would never normally do in a rational state of mind. Malted vanilla with peanut butter and milk chocolate, and SF cheesecake, hot fudge sauce, spiced pecans and almond toffee topping, and their homemade whipped cream. To die for!!!!!!! A whole $5.95. Going back to spoil my workaholic husband. UPDATE: Just took my burnt-out husband over there for a alted caramel whirl of frozen de-lite, and he is a convert. UPDATE UPDATE: Travelling the world, and all I can think of is how I miss my Bi-Rite Sundae...mwah!

About a week ago, I compiled a list of local indie ice cream places throughout the Bay Area and one in L.A.  Well some of you contacted me and insisted that I include Bi Rite in the list, otherwise my list wasn't complete. You were right, and I thank all of you.   I mentioned that Fossilman's chocolate flavor ice cream was an excellent stand alone flavor because of the balance between the semi-sweet and milk chocolate flavor.  Well Bi Rite is a notch above that.  The best way to describe Bi Rite's chocolate ice cream is to describe it as an ice cream version of a Bittersweet Classic drink.  (Please refer to my Bittersweet review in either Oakland or SF) But I didn't stop there.   I actually ordered the brownie sundae.  First of all, the brownie alone was awesome.  Then their homemade caramel and hot fudge...WOW!  Of course I substituted the vanilla ice cream with chocolate.  Hands down, the brownie sundae beats my standard Coldstone order of birthday cake remix...scratch that, no contest whatsoever.  So what if I'm paying almost $2 more, worth it. But I still didn't stop there. For another $.75, they have a "cookie of the day."  Their chocolate chip cookie is up there along with Specialties.  On my next visit there, I'll probably try to pull a "Diddy Riese" and order two cookies and a scoop of ice cream in between.   The staff is extra-ordinarily friendly here.  If it wasn't for the fact that I desperately need to lose weight, I'd ask one of those sweeties out.

Few establishments that draw a crowd large enough to form a line long enough to turn the nearest corner ever serve something good enough to be worth the wait. Pinks in LA comes to mind. However, Bi-Rite Creamery's rich offerings were worth every one of the twenty minutes I spent waiting. Rather than behave like the pair of obnoxious, slovenly dressed Dolores Park hipsters that had to sample every ice cream before choosing, my partner and I decided to order 5 kid sized cups of every flavor that struck our interest. I highly recommend this, because ice creams we initially didn't like ended up impressing us as we finished them. Salted Caramel - lives up to its hype. Creamy, salty, burnt, sweet. Honey Lavender - a good flavor combo with an overpowering lavender aroma Orange Cardamom - too light on the cardamom, but otherwise good. Cookies & Cream - the best rendition of this flavor I have ever had the pleasure to lick off a wooden stick Toasted Coconut - light on the coconut, even lighter on the toasted. The only flavor I'd not order again. Get yourself some scoops and enjoy the people-watching.

A week later, and I'm back (all the way from Santa Cruz, I might add!) We wanted dim sum at Koi Palace in Daly City for lunch (yes, will travel for good food) and were getting into the car to head home when my bf asks "So, you think it'd take long to go get some Salted Caramel ice cream?".  You can't just mention "salted caramel ice cream" and forget about it!  There's just no way! So,  with only one back and forth indecision about the idea, we were on our way.  This time, to the creamery itself! (last time, I took a pint home from the market).   Forget the pint size, this time I got the QUART AND a scoop on a cone to go!

Perfection in the form of ice cream. Why haven't these flavors been around before this place? Also, someone needs to get these people on the mass production bandwagon so my fat ass doesn't have to drive down there to pick up some ice cream. Seriously though, ginger-brown sugar ice cream just wins on so many levels. The salted caramel is good too, but I really think they could rename that flavor molasses cookie. Whatever, still good. A little pricey, but for the quality, it's worth it.

We bought a hand packed quart of Toasted Coconut to bring home and share. It is the smoothest ice cream I've ever set tongue on. So luscious and seductive, it makes girls swoon. The creamy goodness envelops your tongue with a velvety paradise.... The delicious molecules of milk, sugar, and bi-rite perfection take each and every one of your taste buds on a slow dance... smooth and sexy. I absolutely adore the fact that they use organic ingredients from local farmers. That's right, organic ice cream! I don't need more rBST in my system!

This is the best ice cream I've had in the city. I loved the salted caramel ice cream and the toasted coconut. Parking was bad, I had to circle the block a few times and there was a line that stretched to the end of the block but it was soo worth it. The line moved pretty quickly, maybe about a 10-15 min wait. I bought a pint of earl grey ice cream to go ($7.99) and a single cup with 2 flavors was about 3 bucks.

Yum! I love ice cream, and I wanted to stop by and check out their ice cream since I was going to be here anyways (getting lunch from Ike's).  The store is pretty small, with a small counter showing their ice cream selections.  They also sell caramel and hot fudge sauce in small jars and bottles.   We got to try several samples before we decided on what we wanted.  The nice thing about coming here is that you can choose more than one flavor of ice cream.  We each got a small, which comes with 1-2 flavors. I think if you get a larger size, you might be able to get more.   I got the salted caramel with the malted vanilla with peanut brittle.  Those two flavors (IMO) worked together really well; the vanilla cut down on some of the sweetness of the salted caramel.  K got the Coffee Toffee and Mint Chip.  The coffee toffee had a really deep coffee flavor; very reminiscent of espresso.  The mint chip was okay; I just liked that it wasn't green like most mint chocolate chip ice cream is. Two smalls cost $6.50 total; which isn't too bad considering I've paid about $4 for a small ice cream at other places.  They don't give you a huge serving (well, I did get a small), but it was definitely enough to satisfy you considering the ice cream was quite rich.

TIP: If the line is crazy out the door, just walk in to pay for a pint size of the flavor you know you want to get (SALTED CARAMEL?) and you can easily bypass the line with a whole-lotta delicious icecream. (pre-packed) The area was nice, there was a huge park nearby, so probably what created such a long line when i got here... it was a GORGEOUS sunday afternoon!!!! From all the raving shout outs for SALTED CARAMEL, i had to give that a try, and then a few others: ROASTED BANANA, SNICKER DOODLE, EARL GREY They were all great! I was definitely sad they didnt have the Strawberry when i was there. And i didnt get to take my time to pick due to the massive line out the door. The salted caramel was "melt in your mouth good!" and smooth! The snicker doodle had some crisp-ness from the cookies, which was definitely great, flavor wasnt overly sweet like the cookie itself normally is. The roasted banana was like ripe banana's with a slight nutty flavor to fulfill the "toasted" labeling of the name, which was yummy, but i wish i tried the coconut now. Earl Grey was simply and tasted like milk tea.

I feel like this is a recurring theme in my reviews. Overrated. Before I knew what Bi-Rite was all about, I used to think that all of my friends had an unusual obsession with Thrifty ice cream. I had made some sort of weird association between Bi-Rite, Rite Aid, and Thrifty in my head, so whenever someone would rave about BR, I'd just kind of nod and say "Yeah, their ice cream is pretty good, I guess." When I finally found myself actually at Bi-Rite, things began to make more sense. Too bad some things still didn't though. Like why everyone thinks Bi-Rite is so amazing. It's not bad, but if you gave me Bi-Rite ice cream, told me it was from Thrifty, and explained that it was their new taffy/lilac/moose antler flavor, I'd probably believe you.

Question, Mr. Bi-Rite.  When you punched my card for a pint, I only got one hole.  The pint at $7.99 is at least twice the amount of one scoop!  Doesn't that at least warrant two holepunches?  Minus one star.

Considering how many times I've come here and how many people I've brought here, I can't believe I never put in a review. Fortunately I've usually gone at late hours so the lines have never been killer. I'm a huge fan of the salted caramel. I tried the snickerdoodle, but I think I'd prefer to eat the real cookie. The ice cream has a very good, dense texture. I also enjoyed the lavender. I must admit I rarely stray from the caramel. Someday, like after a race when I've burned enough calories, I will try one of thee crazy, calorie-laden sundae combos they have listed. Yum!

The first time I was here was on a nice summer day, but it wasnt very hot, so the place wasnt busy. Dont be confused by the other "bi-rite" signs, especially when you drive by. There was no line outside of the creamery to suggest that it was an ice cream shop. The service was nice and allowed me and my friend to try different flavors. I settled on the strawberry because it has become my bar for good ice cream. The strawberries tasted fresh and was very refreshing, which is a major thumbs up for me. It was creamy, but also has a bit of a tangy kick to it. Came in a cute cone. I didnt feel like a fatass eating it. The second time was on one of those unusually warm days in the winter months. There was a long line that was about to wrap around the corner for this place. I didnt order anything for myself, but shared the salted caramel pint with my friends. As it turned out, I dont think we had to wait in the line if we were just getting a pint! Darn. The Salted Caramel tastes much better than it sounds! It was deliciously creamy and wasnt too sweet. The salty taste wasnt prevalent as the name suggests. My friend raved about it so much that we had to try and it didnt disappoint. Awesome place to stop by if you're planning to chill at Dolores Park that's right across the street. The street is also pretty vibrant and lively on a nice day, with some nice shops, grocery shops, and restaurants around.

Cute small place... and possibly one of the best ice cream experiences I've had.  Very friendly and understanding staff as they were patient with us newbies coming in. ExplaIned flavors and made recommendations. The best part of the whole experience were the flavors. SOOOO WONDERFULLY UNIQUE!!! The most popular being the Salted Caramel which was perfectly complimented by the sugar cone they serve. I also had the Roasted Banana flavor as well which really contrasted the flavor well with the vanilla. I went  in with my girlfriend and my parents. We ALL had a great experience. THANK YOU BI-RITE!! We'll be coming again!!

I'm an ice cream ADDICT and this place ROCKS!  Bi-Rite is my favorite ice cream shop in SF! There's a reason behind the long lines because you will go back again and again once you try it.  Bi-Rite is creamier than most and the flavors are unique.  I appreciate the quality ingredients and inventive flavors. My favorites are: - Coffee Toffee - Salted Caramel - Roasted Bananas Tips:   -If you don't have time to wait on the long lines, get pints from the fridge and pay at the register. -If you don't mind waiting, get the sugar cone with your scoops.

This place lives up to the hype and is worth the wait!  The line moves faster during the weekend surpringly because they are better staffed.  The wait in itself is quite amusing and part of the experience.  You hear talk about favorite flavors and passerbyers wonder what the excitement/line is for. I was so pleasantly surprised at how amazing the flavors are.  I for one never understood the hype behind Mitchell's.  The service is super slow and the flavors are eh.  I would be happier with a carton of Dryers.  YES the salted carmel, balsamic strawberry and roasted banana are all delicious.  Points for the metal spoons for samples and the biodegradable cups and spoons.  They are walking the talk.

These reviews are part of a series where my Vancouverite friend wanted to try a bunch of food carts all weekend.  We ended up deviating to some other cheap eats. The contestants:  Lers Ros Thai, Fritzj, Adobo Hobo, Pizza Hacker, Gumbo Cart, Lumpia Cart, Bi-Rite Creamery, El Farolito, Bacon Dog Cart, Pho Garden, Zante's Indian Pizza This review is about Bi-Rite.  I'm not sure what it is about Bi-Rite that keeps me going back.  The lines are long, the parking is terrible, the service is slow.  Oh, that's right the amazing ice cream!  So it's pretty common but I was first hooked on the salted caramel ice cream to the point where I would drive out of my way to the mission just to pick some up.  Then I started sampling all the other kinds and almost every other flavor there is pretty darn good as well.  Especially the strawberry kiwi sorbet.  The one thing I only thought was okay was their grape popsicles that are made from some farms grapes, eh, it was only okay.   The best thing I learned about this place is that you can cut through that long line and go to the nonexistent line to the right of that if you are buying pints of ice cream.  And with ice cream this good, OF COURSE, you're going to buy pints of it.  Also, it's usually pretty chilly and crowded outside anyways so unless it happens to be a beautiful afternoon, I see no point shivering in the cold eating ice cream.  FYI, it you buy some salted caramel ice cream to bring home, it's meant to be extra soft because it has a ton more sugar than most ice creams so don't think that it's spoiled or anything.  Hope this helps!

I have no idea why in my 30+ years of living in California, I experienced this creamery's delightfulness just recently. My entire family knew about this place. Knew how good it was, but yet failed to inform me of it. I had the roasted banana ice cream and salted caramel on a sugar cone. The salted caramel was good, but the roasted banana....there are no words to describe its perfection! With every lick/bite, you could taste the freshness of the real bananas in the ice cream. None of that artificialness. None. Zilch. Nada. In fact, the ice cream is so fresh that it was melting as I ate it. It made me sad because I sorta had to hurry up and eat the stuff and not be able to thoroughly enjoy my experience of this ice cream. One must venture out to this place at least once in their lifetime. Trust me. They have alot of unique flavors that warrant a head to the side like a little dog, but they do have some flavors that just make you want it instantly! Go Now! What are you waiting for?

Wow, this has got to be the best ice creamery joint in the bay area by FAR. Never have I actually been able to *strongly* taste exactly what is said in each ice cream flavor. Even salt in the salted caramel which wasn't exactly my cup of tea but all of the others I've tried (chocococonut, roasted banana, and coffeetoffee) were amazing. Coffeetoffee is my favorite of all time... I'd probably buy some in bulk next time :) The wait is not as long as ici over in the east bay because they don't go ahead to OFFER you a sample unless you ask for it (hint: because all of it's delicious!) One thing I noticed/LOVED about this ice cream was that it was at a perfect temperature. Not frozen solid so that your spoon can't scoop up any (without making the scoop tumble) but like ooey and gooey and sorta pull-y (?) ifyaknowhadddimean I love that the line moves quickly. seriously it's cold enough outside and i'm waiting in line for your heavenly ice cream. make the torture as bearable as possible please.

YAAAAAAY! It's open during remodeling!!! I was showing my cousins around the Mission before heading to dinner at Delfina, when I saw that it was open! I thought they would be closed for half of March for remodeling, but I guess they are making good progress? They have added a couple of small wooden tables and seats for guests to sit and enjoy ice cream! They were still putting in the tables and seats when we got there.  Such a good thing to do, since before all they had was a bar type set up with a few stools. That's all I could see from the expansion, maybe there will be something more??? Love, love, LOVE their ice cream! I like how they offer you samples of their ice cream in real spoons, instead of little plastic ones. So environmentally friendly! I'm a HUGE fan of the salted caramel ice cream! Just the right blend of buttery caramel and salt. I'm thinking of it again now... I've also had the earl grey tea and honey lavender. I'm a fan of earl grey tea, and this flavor was spot on! And the honey lavender had the right hint of lavender and sweet honey infused together perfectly. I don't know how they do it, but they just know how to blend their ice cream flavors so well, so that all the unique flavors they do have is not overwhelming, but just right on the money! No flavor ever overpowers your senses or leaves your mouth feeling overly coated and perfume-y. Bi-Rite creamery, you are doing some kinda wonderful thing!

I would *never* compare Bi-Rite to Humphry Slocombe. They're two completely different places with their own uniqueness. They're both equally fantastic. Ok, with the said.. onto the review :) This past weekend I did a food excursion in SF. In this excursion, Bi-Rite was a must stop. The way I had planned out my journey, Bi-Rite was almost my last stop of the day. Yet I would pass by it going from place to place (namely walking from Ike's Place to Bi-Rite Market to Tartine) and I would get more and more excited to get my butt in there for some ice cream. When it was finally time for dessert I couldn't hold back my excitement. Got in line, and though it was quite long for an ice cream place, it went by quickly. I read the flavors of the day and just couldn't decide what I wanted.. so I went with four different flavors in a cup. I had the Earl Grey, Roasted Banana, Coffee Toffee, and Salted Caramel. I loved each one of them, but if I had to choose a favorite.. it'd be Earl Grey. I wanted to get a pint to bring home, but wasn't allowed since 1) I was far from home and 2) we weren't headed home just yet.. and who likes liquid ice cream? (I really should have went with liquid ice cream to be quite honest :\ Oh well..) If you like HK style milk tea, then Earl Grey is the way to go. It was perfect. Wonderful full earl grey flavor with the perfect amount of sweetness. I dislike anything too sweet and think that Bi-Rite's ice cream is wonderfully perfect. It soothes that sweet tooth without giving you a rotten one. The other flavors were just as wonderful. Roasted Banana tasted just like it sounds. The wonderful caramelized banana sweetness throughout the creamy ice cream. Coffee Toffee: the buttery toffee enrobed in silky coffee ice cream. Salted Caramel: the savory slight saltiness matched with sweet caramel.. Utterly unbelievable flavors! Verdict: I doubt you can choose a wrong flavor here.. but for me, I will most likely stick to Earl Grey. Absolutely a winnar here! ^_^ PS. Ice Cream. Earl Grey. Cold.

When I walked in yesterday at 7pm there were only two people in front.  I sampled the lavender honey which was a little too sweet for me.  I didn't really taste the lavender, but the honey was pronounced.  I ended up getting the vanilla malt, which has peanut butter toffee and milk chocolate.  It was perfect! The toffee provided a great crunch and the combination was delicious.  While it was indeed good, I think it's a bit over rated because I feel that I've had ice cream just as good else where. Maybe I have to branch out and try more flavors to fully understand. $2.25 for a kids cone was just the right amount of ice cream for me! You can get it in a cup or a waffle cone at no extra charge.

I had no idea where this place actually was. Seeing Bi-Rite written on the wall, I was heading to the little run down market to get some of their well known hand-made ice cream. Little did I know, what I saw wasn't really the real creamery. Strolling along, there was a little store that had red ropes for line control. Then reading the sign above, it said "...home-made ice cream". Then I was like, "wth?" It says Bi-Rite Creamery... Stepped in and the place is quite small, as I already knew from some of the pictures. Clean and traditional inside. Friendly service of course. Plenty of flavors to try out. As many people already know, their salted caramel was the one to try. Delicious and that salt wasn't over powering and it wasn't terribly sweet. Light and creamy in the mouth. Their sorbet is also tart and refreshing. I also had their roasted banana and that was good too. Had hints of smoky roast and their tones of banana. Sweet and enjoyable. I'll definitely come back.

Went here after dinner at Nihon. Getting here was an adventure. Three grown men tried to catch a cab in the pouring rain for 25 mins, making it to Bi-Rite 5 mins before they closed. In other words, I was wet, cold, tired and a little inebriated. I ordered: Sam's Sundae Chocolate ice cream with bergamot olive oil, maldon sea salt and whipped cream All my problems vanished. The ice cream was smooth and rich, the salt was crunchy and the perfect amount, and the olive oil contributed a little aroma and incredible luxurious mouth-feel. We were so grateful to the cab driver for actually picking us up, I bought him a scoop of Orange Cardamom (after tasting it first) and it was so good it almost made me change my order. I will be back, hopefully with more time.

Honey Lavender and Salted Caramel, you should be renamed Sin and Blasphemy, you are so good. Long lines all the time, but worth the wait.  Staff is always pretty chipper, patient and ready to give a suggestion for the overwhelmed customer drooling at the counter.  (Or is that just me...?) Seriously, that ice cream is made on some distant mountaintop by the God of Yum.  The honey lavender has just ECHOES in your mouth with creamy goodness and lingering notes of floral lavender. Pairing it with a cup of Chamomile Lavender tea (from Harney and Sons) afterwards?   Yes, Odin, send your valkyries. I am ready for the halls of Valhalla now. EPIC. By the way, parking.   ALSO EPIC.

Had to write yet another review for BiRite because it made my tummy super dee duper happy today! The wait was a bit longer than what I'm used to here probably around 10-15min because I came by after the early dinner rush. The line was out the door and halfway from the corner of the street, definitely not too bad for a Saturday night. Meyer Lemon. My choice of deliciously creamy poison for the night! Words cannot describe how yummy this tangily sweet and creamy dessert was! Too bad it's a special flavor so they probably won't have it too often! It reminded me a bit of Italian lemon ice, except it was way more creamy than icy. You know how usually acid, like lemon juice, will make milks crumble into a precipitate? Well this definitely didn't! Don't know how they managed to mix a super acid like lemon juice with creamy ice cream (and boy, would I love to know!) but they did and it was yummy goodness!!! I also came by for ice cream last week! Got me some Roasted Banana and Earl Grey in a single scoop. For my thoughts on the roasted banana, see my previous review! :) Earl Grey. Pretty damn good!  Once again a special flavor, sadsies! I need more of this in my life! A bit more on the sweet side than what I'm used to for Earl Grey. Compared to Gelateria Naia this was definitely a lot sweeter. The fragrance of the Earl Grey was pretty strong and really tasted like an Earl Grey milk tea, thanks to the creaminess of the ice cream. I loved them so much I ended up bringing those two pints home with me after I ate my single! I've also tried their Honey Lavender, Ginger, Salted Caramel, Brown Sugar and Balsamic Strawberry. I found their honey lavender to be too fragrant for my liking, I guess I love honey and lavender flavors individually, but together it's just a bit too much for me. Their ginger was good, very ginger-y tasting for a lack of a better description, but if only they had ginger AND rosewater together... NOM! Their salted caramel and brown sugar were also both too sweet for me. The salted caramel legitly tastes like salted caramel but even a small sample was too much for me since I prefer lighter choices. The brown sugar I enjoyed when I had a sample but when I got a kid's scoop, it got to be too sweet for me halfway through but I think it's probably just because I have a lower tolerance for sweets. I love their balsamic strawberry though, creamy goodness of strawberries, yummy in my tummy! Plus it's super good with their Creme Fraiche ice cream as well! Nom! Overall, LOVE Meyer Lemon, Roasted Banana, Balsamic Strawberry and Earl Grey!

Have been there a few times and so far I've only tried their salted caramel and coffee toffee.  Yes its that good that I don't wanna try anything else!  Line is always out the door, around the corner.  Worth the wait and it goes by fast.  Tried my gf's lavender flavored icecream, really does taste like lavender, but I wouldn't order it for myself. ONLY THING is that I grew up on MITCHELLS, a true SF CLASSIC/FAVORITE.  So thats my fav ice cream joint in that neighborhood.  I just think BI RITE lucked out with the BETTER LOCATION.  Wouldn't that be interesting if MITCHELLS and BI RITE were right across the street from each other?!?!!  STIR UP SOME FRIENDLY COMPETITION!

I can officially say i've visited the infamous Bi-Rite Creamery! Went here for the first time over the weekend to finally try their ice cream. They had tons of unique flavors but since i've heard all about the salted caramel, I had to try that one and I also got the roasted banana. Roasted banana ftw! Nice banana flavor, not too sweet, perfect in my eyes. The salted caramel was ok since i'm not too big of a fan of caramel. I think it would be better if they had some more salt crystals sprinkled on top for more salty/sweet contrast. Overall the ice cream is really good, will be back soon to try the other flavors!

This place easily rivals other ice-cream shops. The staff is very friendly and they have some pretty unique flavors. One of my favorites was the roasted banana and vanilla ice cream. It was basically this ice cream with a hint of caramelized banana throughout. Great texture, but I'd recommend ordering only a Kid's size of that, because it can get heavy quickly. My friends ordered their Blood Orange sorbet, which has a citrus-like sweetness followed by a slightly bitter aftertaste from the orange peel. It's an acquired taste. I didn't like it much at first, but I have to say, if you have both the rich, creamy roasted banana and complement it with a refreshing blood orange sorbet, the combination won't leave your taste buds disappointed. It's pretty much a balance of yin and yang flavors, I think. I guess we got lucky with the lines...virtually 0 people in line when we got there. When we left, the line extended beyond the entrance. Perfect ice-cream, perfect SF weather = win.

One of the best ice creams in the city. Perfect on a hot day and perfect on a cold day. It's located across Dolores Park so that makes this place even better. Definitely a place everyone needs to hit up at least 10 times and if you have people visiting the city, take them here! Line may seem long, but it goes by pretty fast. There's a few seats inside the creamery and some benches right outside if you're hanging around. I had the single scoop Toasted Coconut flavor for $3.25 and it was delicious. Little chunks of coconut were in it and it was awesome. I also recommend Honey Lavender and the Banana flavor. The salted caramel is supposedly really good, but tried it and wasn't a fan of it at all.

I loved the salted caramel!  The roasted banana was a nice accompaniment but I'm eager to try other flavors.  The ice cream isn't too sweet, allowing the natural flavors to shine.  This place is a winner. The only thing I don't like is that I'm able capable of eating so much ice cream in one sitting. They really ought to sell their ice creams to markets or open up a location in the south bay.  Just saying...

Delicious ice cream with unique flavors.  Very long line for ice cream that wraps around the block, but moves quickly.  If you're buying a pre-packaged pint or quart, you don't have to wait in that line.  There is a separate line which is much, much shorter. We got the balsamic strawberry, which is mildly flavored, creamy, with just a hint of salty balsamic notes.  I enjoyed it, but it wasn't what I expected.  And of course, the salted caramel.  That was insanely good, but not everyone in our group approved.  There is a STRONG burnt caramel bitter after-taste, that is not suitable for all palates!  I love strong coffee and dark chocolate, so I thought it was just terrific. It's pricey and parking is nearly impossible, so they get dinged a star.  I took BART to 16th street, so that wasn't bad, since I was in the neighborhood anyway.

I had plans to meet a friend at Bi-Rite Creamery recently, so I locked up the bicycle and was lurking around outside, waiting.  The guy inside behind the counter said, "quit lurking around outside; you're creeping me out." (or something to that effect).  I explained I was waiting for someone, he said that doesn't make it any less creepy, and to come inside and start tasting things.  So I complied, and he started handing me spoonfuls of things he thought needed tasting.  Now, people who know me know that giving me bites of things is the easiest way to make me adore you, but this guy didn't even know me.   The ice cream is amazing, they don't overwhelm you with too many choices, and all of the flavors they do have are spot on, so you can trust that whatever you get will be great.  Like their grocery-store sibling, they downright *encourage* tasting.  You also don't have to feel guilty about liking your ice cream in bowls with spoons instead of cones (not that I know anyone like that...) because their bowls and spoons are compostable (make sure to put them in a composting can when you are done, not a trash can!)  And, finally, they give you a big, beautiful park right across the street to eat your ice cream in.   Now, with all of that wonderfulness, it's understandable that there can sometimes be a bit of a line.  Which is why Bi-Rite Creamery is at the top of my list of places to hit up when most of SF is toiling away at their jobs.

I agree with all the 4/5-star reviews.  Bi-Rite Creamery brings a nostalgic, old-time ice cream parlor feel that's spot-on with what the neighborhood wants.  Mission hipsters might not have the money to eat at Delfina but they can go to the pizzeria next door and treat them selves to an affordable luxury that's now become ice cream.  As a business guy though, I have one thing for you to think about:    How does Bi-Rite make all its money???   Folks, it's called over-run.  Over-run is the amount of air that's whipped into the ice cream during the manufacturing process.  Take home a $9 pint of Bi-Rite ice cream and feel the weight of it vs. a $4 pint of Haagen-Dazs.  Yeah, it's light as a cloud...  so there's less milk per pint of Bi-Rite vs. other branded pints you'll find in the regular grocery store.  With sky-rocketing cost of dairy, this keeps Bi-Rite creamery in business.   But what gets me is that  people don't realize that they're sacrificing all this rich butterfat that makes ice cream so indulgent.   But does it matter when you can get flavors like "Honey Lavender" or "Creme Fraiche?"   This place is gold mine as far as I'm concerned.  Capitalism still lives!

The line is really worth it. And, if you at all can, get some to take home. You'll regret it if you don't. My hands down favorite is the honey lavender. The balsamic strawberry was really good too. I loved that it tasted like real strawberries, not chemical strawberry flavor. The salted caramel is good, the brown butter pecan was good (although I'm not really a fan of pecans). This place is worth it. Period.

I Keep hearing about this magical ice cream parlor called Bi-Rite.   So i decided to take a little trip to try this famous place.  I was told there was always a line out the door. First of all there wasn't a line but there were many people showing up after I arrived.   Their single scoop is two little scoops where you can pick one to two flavors. I choose honey lavender and ginger for my flavors. they were refreshing for $4.  Can't complain about that. I went back another time and got one of their homemade Popsicle (strawberry) best Popsicle I have ever tasted! I was excited to see that their sampling spoons were real spoons (Environmentally friendly!) However, the servers were quite rude at times.  One gentleman in particular talked to me in a condescending tone when i asked to try a flavor I couldn't pronounced and mocked me in front of the other customers.  Overall my experience was decent at most, if you can tolerate this rude individual (who is always there) than the ice cream is worth it! When getting a single order two very different types of flavors it enhances each flavor individually. you will not regret it!

When bi-rite opened, I did not know what to expect. I grew up in the cold, but I would eat ice cream in winter, spring, summer, or fall. The first time and every time I have visited Bi-Rite I have loved there ice cream. My favorites are the salted caramel and the honey lavender. I have tried some of there soy and some of there sorbets, also interesting. I also had a peanut butter one that I liked as well. Recently, on my way to a barbecue, I picked up there cookies and cream ice cream pie. It was delicious. Everyone loved it. The flavors were right, there were enough cookies, and it melted in our mouths. Also, I didn't have to wait in line to get it. I just got my pie, walked up to the register, and paid. One drawback is the constant line. There is a ray of sun and bi-rite is packed. I am not going to criticize being popular, as they don't rush anyones experience and the line does move fast. I would certainly put this in the league with Mitchell's, Swenson's, and Fenton's.

Okay this place is ridiculous. I've had this place bookmarked for the longest time and a friend and I decided to come here on a whim last Saturday. We looked it up to find the addy and it had a whopping 1711 reviews and now just merely two days later it's up to 1868. Ridiculous. Anyway, the weather on Saturday wasn't pretty but there is a line outside, like down the end of the block. Well okay, the place is almost at the end of the block but there were still a good 10 people waiting in line. Just plain ridiculous, this place. Luckily the line moved quickly. I got the balsamic strawberry and creme fraiche. The creme fraiche is like vanilla but much much richer. For anyone whose Chinese, it was like eating the white rabbit candy in ice cream form. The Balsamic strawberry was okay, the flavor was a bit more muted than i'm used to but it was probably because of the balsamic taste, whatever that is. I dig how this little ice cream shop makes their own ice cream, offers lots of interesting variety and does it the natural way, so I will probably be back.

Yummy!! I usually get a small with Salted Caramel and Honey Lavender.  I've tried a bunch of other flavors, and they're all good.  I love the little twists they add to ordinary flavors.  This is also the place that made me realize my love for salt in ice cream =) The flavors can be a bit too sweet like others have mentioned, but what makes Bi-Rite stand out from any other shop for me is the rich, creamy consistency that they have (vs. those with flakier consistency i.e. Mitchell's).   There's usually a line on hot days, but the wait's never been too bad.  Seating is very limited, so plan on getting it to-go.  Since there're so many great restaurants nearby, it offers a great (and cheap!) option for dessert to finish off.

Bi-Rite greeted us with a long line that snaked around the corner. But we weren't deterred, long line means that it is worth the wait. And oh boy, it did not disappoint! I got the Balsamic Strawberry and Creme Fraiche. My friend Allison got the Strawberry and Honey Lavender. And my friend Chris got the toffee coffee and chocolate. The strawberry was the strawberriest tasting ice cream I ever had! It has to be the balsamic that brought out the fruity tart of the strawberry. And Creme Fraiche tasted like my favorite dessert=Cheesecake! Therefore, my strawberry cheesecake combo was freaking amazing...it was Bi-mazing! The Honey Lavender that I tasted was also bi-rrific! I didn't get to the coffee or chocolate, but my friends thought they were bi-licious! Flavors I want to check out next time: Roasted Banana and Salted Caramel! Definately the top high-end ice cream place around (sorry Ici). Just looking at these pictures, they are bi-vine (hey, that one actually works!).

The ice cream scooper was probably one of the nicest one I've ever met. He let me try like 5 of them, and yes, they give you real spoons! I don't know if getting ice cream for breakfast was the best idea, but I couldn't resist...I ended up with the Coffee Toffee, which tasted less like coffee and more like toffee. The coffee flavor was light but the ice cream was very sweet. Roasted Banana and Salted Caramel were strong flavors, but also very sweet. The toasted coconut was less flavorful. I should have tried some of the fruitier ones...next time!

I normally do not like this which are either sweet or creamy.  Needless to say, ice cream is not something I usually bother eating. Over here, I like the cinnamon ice cream a lot.  It is less sweet than the other flavors and also has a good taste and texture.  I can still only eat about half a kiddie order, but that's more ice cream than I usually eat. Most of the other ice creams here are too sweet for me.  I can tell from eating them that they are high quality and have a nice texture, but I cannot eat more than a bite or two of most of them because of the sweetness. I also sampled the green apple sorbet, and I liked it.  I want to try one of their fruit popsicles too.  The sign advertising is placed beyond the cash register, so I always forget they have them until I already ordered something else.

4 stars, because of the long line, and out of 6 flavors we tried, only 3 was exceptionally good (standard is higher b/c of the wait) =p 1. roasted banana 2. salted caramel 3. earl grey!!! roasted banana.... oh so goood... mixed with salted caramel... even better!!! i need to forget about my waist-size when indulging their ice cream, but it's ok because you'll feel like you're in heaven and nobody cares about your waist-size in heaven... so creamy, so thick, and not too sweet... i want them to throw a scoop of roasted banana into my mouth right now!!! we also tried apple sorbet, cookies&cream, and one other special flavor (brown sugar swirl or something)... apple sorbet tasted like a bit like eating frozen apple sauce, and cookies&cream was nothing special. but ROASTED BANANA makes up for it!!! also, the line is not as bad as it seems... it moves fairly quickly =)

If heaven offered ice cream, they would serve Bi-Rite Ice Cream (and possibly Mitchell's Ube Ice Cream, heh). But seriously, it's good. My girlfriend and I came here during a mild summer day. The line wasn't as bad as we expected, but it was out the door a bit. All of the flavors on the menu sounded really good, but we went for the famous salted caramel, and honey lavender. Who'd have known that salt and sugar would go hand in hand so well? The Honey Lavender was really good as well! One of the most enjoyable things is to get an ice cream cone from Bi-Rite, then head over to Dolores Park and chill. Can't wait to do it again!

Its good but not crazy good. Arrived around 1:45pm on a Wednesday, surprisingly their was no line. (although it was a cold day) The smell of freshly baked cookies roamed the air as I walked in, two friendly workers waited to take my order as I took everything in and stared blankly at all the choices contemplating on what to get. The workers were extremely friendly and patient they let me sample some of the ice cream so I decided to get what I sampled. I had the salted caramel and Riornal (sorry if its spelled wrong, I couldn't even pronounce it). The salted caramel tasted more like burnt caramel but it was good (expected too much) but the Riornal was delicious with a little crunch to it, (forgot what was in it), loved the little wooden chairs and really got this home feel too it when I first walked in. Soft, cold, with a melt in your mouth sensation but sadly it melted pretty fast. Overall It was a pleasant experience, burned off the calories of ice cream as I walked to Ike's Place to get my sammich, Definetly worth a try if your in town

It is just so damn good. I got lost trying to find this place but then again where do I not get lost?? Anyways, came here with two friends driving in the rain and finding parking with approximate directions haha. We ended up finding the bi-rite market that is like a block away and had to walk to the actual ice cream shop a bit away. Kind of funny really. I got the salted caramel and coffee (i think...) and my friends got like lavender and stuff but we all had to agree it was fab and totally worth enduring the weather. I'll be back someday to try your strange olive oil ice cream thang when I'm back in town!!! *p.s. this is from a winter experience in sf--- so old review*

Salted caramel. Sounded sketchy........... BUT LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!! Cute little place, line out the door but it moves pretty quick. So many different flavors. All of them are good but my favorite is obviously salted caramel. It's nice that it's across the street from the park (don't know the name). So on a nice day, it's nice to get some ice cream & sit on the grass to enjoy. Parking is a factor that determines whether I'm making a trip there or not. But that's just too bad for me.

Unique flavors, friendly staff. I came here sometimes with long lines, sometimes with no lines. Love how you can get 2 scoops when you order a single, etc. My favorites are probably the Roasted Banana and Toasted Coconut. The Salted Caramel is an all time favorite, everyone tries it and almost EVERYONE likes it. It's a little bit TOO salty for me, I always find myself thirsty after finishing the scoop and it overpowers the other flavor I get :/ They have sundaes, and popsicles, even sorbets. They sell by the pint too. Parking is a little hard to find but the area is magnificent. Dolores park nearby, ice cream on a good day? Sure, why not.

MY FAVORITE ICE CREAM SPOT IN SF! Why its so good? The variety of flavors are unique and different from your average ice cream place ie, cold stones, baskin robins, etc..and also VERY VERY affordable. You are allowed to try flavors before purchase. My favorite: Roasted banana and balsamic strawberry. Sam's sundae and Brownie sundae (better than a pizookie!) are good if you want a large serving of ice cream. Its also enough for 3 people to share. Others Ive tried that are good: salted caramel, coffee toffee, cookies and cream, honey lavender (varies for some people), Riccanelas (snickerdoodle) If you have family from out of town bring them here. Lines are long at night on the weekends but they have fast service so you wont be waiting that long. I also suggest that if you are a frequent Birite customer to get their hole punch card because after 10 hole punches in your card you get a free scoop which benefitted me in the long run because at one point I was able to fill up 2 cards!

Even at 10pm, there was a line wrapping around the corner! But if you're craving homemade ice cream, this is the place to go! I got the four scoops..because I couldn't decide which flavors to get so I went with all four! I got the salted caramel (of course) the balsamic strawberry, the coffee toffee, and the honey lavender. I have to admit though the salted caramel had the most unique taste. Each flavor just shot your mouth with flavor and definitely lived up to expectation! I have to admit though, my favorite flavor was roasted Banana. But that's definitely by preference. If you ever want to cut the line, just buy a pint and take it home to eat!

They opened up a soft serve stand next to the shop so don't make the mistake of waiting int he wrong line (it'll be the longer one haha). The line was pretty long even though it was kinda cold and windy when we went.  Good thing is the line moves along pretty fast.  They have some unique flavors like the salted caramel, honey lavender, creme fraiche, strawberry balsamic, etc.  They've also got some premade sundaes to choose from and suggest which flavors might go well together. My friend got the Sam's Sundae.  It's the one with chocolate, salt, and olive oil.  I tasted it and I think they put a bit too much salt in there...I mean I like the salty sweet thing...but it was really salty.  The olive oil was also interesting.  It added this strange fruity, savory flavor. It was hard to decide, but I finally decided on 3 flavors. Salted Caramel Tasty!  Salty, but not too much so. Honey Lavender The honey is local and you can taste the subtle flavor in the ice cream.  The lavender is in there too, but doesn't overwhelm the honey.  It's a nice balance. Strawberry Balsamic It tastes more or less like regular strawberry ice cream.  The balsamic is in there, but super light.  If you didn't tell me it was strawberry balsamic I don't think I could pick it out. Overall pretty good ice cream, but expect to pay 5-6 bux for it.  I'm pretty sure my Chinese dad would not understand haha.  I'd say it's worth trying cause the ice cream is good and they do have some unique flavors.  There were definitely a few more flavors there I wanted to try.

If you ever find yourself around Dolores Park on a beautiful day, but decide against chillen on the grass because the only space is in-between those dudes sword-fighting with branches and the ones blowing bubbles... then come to Bi-Rite. I always get a scoop of the roasted banana and I don't even really care about bananas that much.  That good. Tip:  Avoid the lines and come during a weekday.  It's good, but it ain't Disneyland.

So, i've been in the  bay area for over a decade and never heard of this spot.  It took a friend visiting from hawaii to discover it. First off, if at all possible bike or walk here, there is NO parking!  Once you get there be ready for the line that awaits you.  When we got there it was around the corner.  It did move fairly quickly and i gotta say it is worth the wait. Seems like the salted caramel was the signature flavor so went with that and some coffee something. The coffee was good but that salted caramel is the TRUTH!  I'm not even going to try to explain it.  Just go and get a scoop.  You will understand why there is a line!

Instructions for lifting your spirits if alone and wandering the mission for under $20.00. 1. Hit up Yamo, and fill your tummy with things tasty and magical. 2. Take a stroll west on 18th on the north side of the street until you hit Bi-Rite Creamery 3. Stand in line and listen to the conversations around ya. 4. Look at the menu and make a selections (I recommend the roast banana, salted caramel, or the honey lavender). 5. Sit out on the benches and enjoy your ice cream while people watching.

4 stars - SF institution, creamy goodness, things to do If you haven't heard Bi Rite is the place to go if you want ice cream in SF. Itry to avoid crowds and lines because, frankly, people have no situational awareness anymore and are freakin rude; but, I will endure up to an hour in line at Bi-Rite to get a few scoops of this creamy, yummy goodness. Service is great and funny! They do their best to control people so you cant blame them. Perfect on a sunny day after a sausage party. Ample bike parking. Lots of stuff going on in the neighborhood. tips: listen for instructions, know what you want, have your money ready, leave the strollers outside, be courteous, don't be a jerk or else i'll dump my ice cream on your head. kinda got the feeling it's one of those places to be "seen at"

Two words: Honey Lavender. Okay, wait. I have more to say: It was my first time at Bi-Rite and I asked a woman in line what her fave flavor was.  She offered Honey Lavender and Salted Caramel.  Well, I'll tell you folks.  That Honey Lavender blew my mind. If you like really creamy ice cream, with a hint of something-something, you'll love Bi-Rite. The line moves decently fast even if it's around the block on a hot day in August.  AND, the girl behind the counter gave me another scoop when she saw that I'd almost finished mine before getting around to paying for it (it was THAT good!). Told me she couldn't have me leaving the store with a near empty cone!

I debated between 4 and 5 stars.  With the creamery portion of Bi-Rite there are these detractions: it's too small, there's usually a huge line, the staff has always been consistently rather snotty, and every single flavor isn't astoundingly phenomenal.  Most are really wonderful, but three or four are just okay.   My highest recommendation to anyone alive on this planet who's not vegan or has a dairy allergy: TRY THE SALTED CARAMEL.  It will change your life.   It certainly changed mine and what I consider the gold standard for salted caramel ice cream and what I consider partial heaven on earth and what I consider worth living for.  It is a superior ice cream to all other ice creams.  It is so perfectly balanced, with such intense caramel flavor, and the texture, oh god, the texture is perfectly light and fluffy and rich and creamy at the same time.  I could go on...I'll leave it at - it's one of the great loves of my life.  I don't know what I'd do without it. But so other flavors that I've tried and loved are brown butter pecan, creme fraiche, roasted banana (so good!  perfect with chocolate sauce!), mint chip, honey lavender, and the snickerdoodle one.  All fantastic!  However, the Mexican chocolate with salted almonds was actively bad.  But, maybe it was just the batch.  Also, the rituals coffee is just OK and the rocky road definitely needs more rocks in the road.  So, one star off for inconsistency and service.  But oh, how much I love you Bi-Rite Creamery!

EARL GREY TEA ICE CREAM! We've lived in the area for over a year now and Bi-Rite Creamery is pretty much the crown jewel of our 18th street paradise. We love the seasonal flavors like pumpkin and now earl grey tea! Bi-rite is arguably the best ice cream in the city. I'm a fan of Mitchell's and Humphrey Slocombe too, but those are two ends of a spectrum from homey, traditional flavors to radical and outlandish...and bi-rite sits squat in the middle, with more tame favorites like coconut, rituals coffee toffee, and mexican hot chocolate...plus their uniquely original ones like salted caramel and honey lavender. You MUST go by bi-rite if you're in the Mission or Castro, but watch out for the longer lines, even on cold nights at 9:50pm!

But this place changed my perspective on it.  You keep seeing it in the reviews, but the Salted Caramel is phenomenal.  I can honestly say I've never had ice cream this delicious.  It was and always will be worth the line in front of the store.

I was in the Bay Area this past weekend and my friend sugggested we go here for dessert.  So we gathered the kids and started driving.  When we got there at 9:00 PM there was a big line and the parking was pretty much nonexistent....I was beginning to think..."I don't even like ice cream that much.  No ice cream joint is worth the hassle..."  I was very, very wrong!  We finally found parking, packed up and bundled up the kiddies and stood in line.  Surprisingly, the wait was not very long, but gave me enough time to decide what I wanted to get. My son got the vanilla which my son claimed to be the best vanilla ice cream he ever had!  And it must have been because he didn't want to share...which he is usually very good about. My SO got the coffee toffee with the peanut brittle.  This was delicious!  The coffee was not too sweet and actually tasted like coffee!.  The toffee's sweetness offset the bitterness of the coffee perfectly!  It really didn't need the peanut brittle topping. I got the burnt brown sugar with a ginger caramel swirl and salted caramel.  Both were amazing, however the brown sugar was a little too sweet for me.  I really enjoyed the salted caramel!!  The salty and the sweet combo is just to die for!  I don't like my ice cream to be too firm, I prefer to have it slightly soft so it's easy to eat. The texture of the ice cream was perfect for me!   We were standing at night, in the cold, with the winds of San Francisco blowing outside as we ate ice cream.   Funny thing...the ice cream seemed to warm me up...Would the owners ever consider opening one up in Long Beach....

Possibly the best ice cream I've eaten. The Salted Caramel was bold and perfectly sugary, the Ricanelas had plenty of cinamon and chewy (not soggy) snickerdoodle cookies, and the Honey Lavender actually TASTES LIKE lavender. Staff were friendly and patient. Plus, there's a beautiful park to sit at just across the street! Fantastic. I would go here every day if I could.

Okay. I don't know why it took me so long to try this place out. i mean, i've only lived in this city all my life and strolled through this neighborhood one or more times.... Then came last Saturday afternoon. A couple friends and I were people watching and enjoying our Ike's sandwiches at Dolores Park. If that doesn't sound perfect already, we of course decide to do it big and pop my Bi-Rite cherry when we walked in on it empty and waiting to please us. I was pretty excited, since i've never been (i was raised on Mitchell's! i know...i know...). I didn't really sample much, and decided to get a kiddie size of the salted caramel. .... mmm..mmmmm....MMMMMM!!! Veeeery good!!! The perfect melange of sweet and salty! The consistency was so nice and smooth! And don't let the kiddie size deceive you. That single scoop of goodness is just enough to satisfy your frozen creamy cravings without the brainfreeze or sweetness overdose. I'll definitely be coming back....just thinking... what flavor to try next....

Holy motherfucking donkey shit.  Ice cream does NOT get better than this!  I remember coming back from a trip to Italy saying nothing could beat Italian gelato, when all of a sudden Bi-Rite Creamery opens up out of nowhere.  It's like they're holding up a giant middle finger to all the other ice cream shops in the city.  Honestly, who makes ice cream this good? You cannot go wrong with any flavor, but some personal favorites include Toffee Coffee, Roasted Banana, and let's not forget the beast-status SALTED MOTHERFUCKING CARAMEL.  It's places like Bi-Rite that make me wish I lived in the Mission.  God help us all.

So Bi-Rite is good.. its Ice Cream.. Ice Cream is good, BUT... Bi-Rite is SOOOOO OVER-HYPED!  Going to Bi-Rite is like seeing a movie all your friends have talked up but leaving the movie theater disappointed.   I tried the salted caramel and it was just OK.  I was VERY let down by the brownie sundae I had, the brownie was stale and uneventful.  To top it off, there is always a long line here and my first trip was no exception.  I would go again, but only if I didn't have to wait in line... So I doubt I'll be making my way back there any time soon. You want real ice cream?  Mitchell's is the place!!

I came here and ordered the salted caramel, coffee toffee, toasted coconut, and ricanelas (cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodles). The ricanelas was to die for but everything else was just okay to me. I'm a huge coconut fan and I've had much better. The salted caramel, in my opinion, was a little overrated. The coffee toffee was pretty good too. I think I'll stay true to Mitchell's for my ice cream cravings, but I'll definitely come back for the ricanelas.

Salted caramel tasted like burnt marshmellows (in a good and bad way, just like a burnt marshmellow does!)  Balsamic strawberry was okay--you expect it to be way insane with such a non-traditional pairing of flavors, but it's just a different style of strawberry ice cream.  The true standout was the amazingly buttery brown sugar with the sweet ginger caramel--that alone was worth the wait.  Can't say the price is, though.

The salted caramel was delicious, as was the basil that I got with it. It probably wasn't the best idea to eat that right before dinner, but holy whack, it was good!

I can't believe I only heard/ tried this place for the first time this past Sat!  A group of us went there at 10:30pm and there was a line that went out the door!  There was even a red velvet rope that contained the line.  Driving by this place, you'd think people were in line to get into a VIP club.  Oh yeah, and it was raining!   So we waited in the line, outside in the rain for about 15 min.  I was able to sample the salted caramel, ricanelas (cinnamon w/snickerdoodle), honey lavender, and toasted coconut.  $3.25 for two scoops (you can get two flavors).  Least favorite of the four was honey lavender because it actually tastes like lavender.  But the other flavors...omg so tasty!  I need to go back and try the rest of their menu now!

Not much else can be added to previous reviews. If the line reaches the corner intersection, the wait is about 25-30mins. It's definitely worth the wait.  Balsamic strawberry and roasted banana are my favorite.  Oh so creamy without being too milky or icy.  Flavors are mild, and something about eating off of a wooden stick rather than a plastic spoon reminds me of childhood ice cream trucks. I try to stop by here whenever I'm in the city.  You should too!

Great ice cream, great selection of flavors, great creamy taste.  Can't really argue with ice cream.

Definitely waaaay better than Humphrey slocombe, which I didnt enjoy much. This place knows how to properly balance some odd flavors and being able to enjoy more than a spoonful of it at a time. Service was blah. The workers didnt seem happy to be there, and just wanted to get the eff out and go home. Parking is horrid. I had the orange cardamom and coconut.. Im a sucker for all things coconut, but Im going to say it was just alright. The orange cardamom was pretty good.. I didnt get much of a cardamom taste though. I tasted the roasted banana and salted caramel. The roasted banana tasted like banana.. Good, though. I haaaated the salted caramel. It tasted like superly overly burnt creme brulee. Basically it tasted like burned sugar. Not a fan. Also not a fan of all the hipsters. Why cant I avoid them?!

I am on a MOTHER FUCKING FOOD KICK. Salted Caramel (two scoops, because they have two scoops in a single order) + Balsamic Strawberry + Roasted Banana (two different flavors for my second order - YES I HAD A SECOND ORDER, FUCK DIETS!)  = worth the almost 3-hour round trip drive from San Jose during rush hour. I wish the parking situation was better, but I guess having to walk 5 blocks makes up for eating 4 scoops of ice cream within a 45-minute time span.... almost.

I had heard so much about this place, so my anticipation was high.  Plus when I hear about a place that has good vegan ice cream i start salivating.  So when i finally got a chance to try here on a Dolores park movie night, I stopped by.  I got excited when i saw all the crazy flavors posted on the window.  When i get inside and see the full selection though... soy chocolate, and soy vanilla. really?  You have fleur de sel, lavender, chai, and all these really crazy flavor experiments and the best you can do for what I'd imagine is not an insignificant portion of your San Francisco customer base is chocolate?  Wow, did you stay up all night thinking how to make vanilla beans vegan, and then collapse in exhaustion? If I lived across the street from this place, I'm not sure I'd stop by even then.  Most bodegas in the city have a good selection of vegan ice creams, and I can get a pint for about the same price as a cone at bi-rite. If there selection improves, let me know.  Otherwise I'm going to drive right by on my way to Maggie Mudd.

Holy crap!  Bi-Rite's ice cream is so good that it may just make you forget that the frozen yogurt fad ever made it to the bay area.  This stuff is the real deal.  Not only is the ice cream insanely delicious, but the flavors are innovative and downright amazing!  They do have typical flavors like mint chip and cookies and cream, but where else can you get flavors like balsamic strawberry and honey lavender? Ok so you'll stand in line about 10 times longer than it takes you to inhale your ice cream but, it's totally worth it!  Oh yeah and you gotta love them for using biodegradable cups!  So go grab a buddy, be good in line, and get ready to indulge in the best ice cream you'll ever have.

Ummm... it tasted like... can't quite put my finger on it... oh yeah, ice cream. Sure, some of the flavors are original, and they kinda give you 2 scoops for the price of 1, and I liked my Mexican Chocolate. (I didn't enjoy the honey lavender, it tasted like flowers and I don't like eating flowers)  BUT would I go all the way to SF and wait in line for this again?  Not so likely.

6 tastings, 3 generous scoops, and less than $5 later, I was sitting happily on a bench outside Bi-Rite enjoying my yummy ice cream (grudgingly sharing with J... good thing he doesn't really care for sweets...) and watching the critical mass crowd pedal by. Salted caramel - very interesting. Delicious when combined with another sweet flavor. Will definitely get it again Honey lavender - while I enjoyed this flavor (esp paired with the salted caramel), J thought it tasted like soap. It ruined it a little for me. I don't think I can get this again... will just end up thinking about lavender soap. :( Ginger - quite good. Wish it were a bit more gingery and less cream-y. Might get it again, but probably only with the salted caramel.

Could not believe that there was no line in front, so we quickly found parking and went to the infamous Bi-Rite Creamery.  Yes I tried the salted caramel ice cream which was excellent, but I was sold on the roasted banana and the brown sugar carmalized ginger ice cream.  The kids loved their scoops of cookies and cream and chocolate.  I'll have to go back and get a banana split one of these days.   Cookies and chocolate cake was good too.  Don't pass up the baked goods when you go.

I LOVE this place.  As cold as it can get, there's usually always a line (we once stood outside in 45 degree weather).   My favorite is the coffee toffee.  They have a lot of different flavors, such as salted caramel and lavender (it tastes exactly the way it smells).  You do have the opportunity to sample.   The only downfall is that there isn't much room to sit.  The few benches they have in the front around the trees are usually full.

Came here after 10 pm last night and there was a line down the block -_-. What?!? Okay, the ice cream is really great and when you ask for samples they give it to you on reusable spoons!

I love places that don't always do everything, but what they do, they do well.  This is one of those places. You can spot Bi-Rite by the line flowing out the door. It's neatly organized, and moves surprisingly quickly.  I've now gone there twice, and every time I head up to San Francisco, there's at least a fleeting thought..."Should I swing by Bi-Rite?"  The staff is very helpful, more than happy to provide you with samples, so you can make an informed decision, and well, if it sounds interesting, you should try it, because it probably is.  I've had their Earl Grey, salted caramel, honey lavender, coffee toffee, and brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl.  And I've had the Sam's Sundae, which is odd sounding, but spectacular tasting. The ice cream has a wonderful texture, it's not over priced for the quality you get, and you can get more flavors than you'd expect for each size, so you feel like you're beating the system, which is always a good feeling.   Here's the kicker to spectacular ice cream. The servers here are very friendly, and make you feel very welcome and appreciated.  It may not be the easiest place to park, but if you're in the mission, it's a great snack, or a great way to end an evening.

WOW. One of the absolute best ice cream places in the bay area along with Mitchell's, Bombay Creamery (if you like original ice cream flavors), and a select other few. I don't like standing in lines outside of stores, but for this place i'll make an exception.  I've only been here a couple of times, but i'm in love.  I have a wicked sweet tooth and this place soothes it every time. The Banana Split...The blow torched bananas (and they blow torch them right in front of your eyes) are pretty awesome, as is the freshly made whipped cream. The Afternoon Snack...I'm not sure how long this sundae will be available since it's seasonal, but if i were them, i'd add this on as a permanent fixture.  The banana ice cream and the freshly made graham crackers make this a dream...throw on the caramel and you have dessert bliss! I hear that there are some pretty ridiculously great flavors that i haven't yet tried, so i'm looking forward to going back and giving them all a go...especially the sea salt caramel flavor...what the heck is that?!?! Happy Eating!

Yes, I am one of those people standing in the line that wraps around 18th & Dolores... I sometimes sit in a strategic spot in Dolores Park to see when the line seems a little shorter and make a run for it! I've tried almost all of their flavors but I generally get the salted caramel.

The line looks long, but it actually goes by pretty quickly. We waited 10 minutes when the line extended to the end of the block. The wait is worth it for the unique flavors and delicious ice cream. With a small cup, you can get 2 flavors. I had the salted caramel and malted vanilla with peanut brittle. I was very happy with my selections. The salted caramel has a rich deep flavor that I liked, though I wouldn't get an entire cup of it. They also have traditional flavors like mint chip and cookies and cream. If you just want to buy prepacked ice cream, you can skip the line.

I came at a time where there no line (~6:00PM). If you want good ice cream, come here. Everybody orders the Salted Caramel Ice Cream. However, I would NOT recommend getting this as I didn't really like it. I would also NOT recommend the Honey Lavender Ice Cream--it tastes like some sort of soap. I would recommend ordering the Roasted Banana Ice Cream. I tried these three flavors and the Roasted Banana was the best. Get it in a cone. $3.25 for a single scoop is a little much, but just about worth it for a unique tasting experience. I know this place gets super busy at peak hours so try to come during a time where there probably is not an influx of people.

I am giving a five star rating just for their ginger flavor ice cream.  I ordered a single cup with half and half of ginger and brown sugar but I wish I had gotten just the ginger by itself.  Although the brown sugar was also a good flavor, it weakened the flavor of the ginger.  Also tried their salty caramel and roasted banana after reading all the reviews but I didn't really care for those.  The salty caramel tasted way too bitter and salty.  My other favorite was ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles).   Their ice creams are really creamy and don't have small chunks of ice crystals like some of the cheaper places.  I would come back to SF just so I can try all their other flavors.

I'm docking one star because I had to come here FOUR times before I could finally get a bite of their deliciousness that is ice-cream. And parking is a major pain too. But other than that, when I finally got to try their ice-cream (after a 20 minute wait in line), it didn't disappoint. I got the earl grey and salted caramel. The earl grey was not too creamy or strong, and the salted caramel was the perfect mix of sweet and salty. Both left a very pleasant after taste. Can't wait to go back again!

OMG. This is THE place for ice cream on a nice San Francisco day (or even if it's chilly)! Flavors that I've tried so far and can't wait until I try some more: Salty Caramel Roasted Banana Lavender Honey   Earl Grey Ricanelas Toasted Coconut Tried Food Network's featured: Sam's Sundae with Chocolate ice cream with bergamot olive oil, maldon sea salt and whipped cream. I thought it was OK. Would of tasted better if they sprinkled more sea salt. Tips: Go on a weekday before 3pm. Normally the line is SUPER LONG (especially weekends). So I find it safe going around 1pm or so and it's perfect.

Pro: Most flavorful ice cream everrrr. Definitely an experience for palate and sugar tooth. Con: Way too many flavors to choose from. The line also took 30 mins when it was like below 50 degrees outside. Crazy sf ice-cream fanatics! Also a bit costly for ice-cream, but worth it. Weapon of choice (to my gut!): Salted caramel and roasted banana. Verdict: The ice cream was rich and smooth, but I wish I chose the toasted coconut instead of the roasted banana after trying my buddy's. The salted caramel was also extremely overpowering!

I've been back a few times since my original review, and wowza, this place has gotten crazy popular! There's been a line out the door and down the street on each of my visits. Although, somehow the staff keeps the line moving, without making you feel rushed when it's your turn. I've tasted a few flavors, but my favorites are the cinnamon with snickerdoodle, and the salted caramel. I also appreciate that they'll do two flavors in my cone, even though i always order a small. This place renewed my love of ice cream, and coming here is a such a treat!

There are two ice cream stores within about two miles of each other. One of those is living a sustainable existence, complete with the coolest cats in town scooping the most delicious, fresh ice cream the city has to offer. The other is no longer on my radar now that I have found my home at Bi Rite. I have waited up to an hour to spoon the freshest, sweetest local ice cream into my mouth and have also stopped by in the middle of the day, when it was 91 in SF and waited roughly 10 minutes. If you hate HATE waiting on line, you are in luck. You can bypass all the lovely folks texting, facemashing (anyone catch that?) and yapping and head inside. If all you want is a prepackaged pint or quart of bundled goodness, you can grab it from the freezer and head straight for the finish line. They have the most amazing Vegan blend of chocolate and coconut that honestly tastes like it's got some moo cow hidden in it and the Brownie sundae ( I always add choco sprinkles to bring out the 9 year old in me) is truly heaven served chilled.

I also got a packet of their goat milk caramels for my bf, he seemed to like them a lot too =).

mmm, just writing this yelp-review makes me want a BiRite cone right now. BiRite can easily take come classic flavors like, chocolate chip, vanilla, chocolate, mint chip, cookies and cream and make them infinitely better. But what makes this place stand out from your typical cold-stone or half gallon from Safeway is the fresh ingredients that they use and the ice cream is so creamy it reminds me of gelato. The coffee toffee is my favorite! You can see they use real coffee beans with chunks of toffee sprinkled throughout. Flavors to try: Malted Vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate! Ginger, salted caramel! Ricanelas is okay. It just taste like cinnamon ice cream Honey Lavender: is great for the first 3 licks, but like all lavender ice cream, you can't really taste the lavender towards the end.

I seriously wish I lived in San Francisco so I can eat here all the time and get fat. The ice cream here is soo amazingly good! My friend has been hyping this place up for months, so on our recent trip to SF, we had to stop by to see what it was all about. It was freezing the night we stopped by. We couldn't find decent parking, so a few of us ran in to get ice cream while the others idled in the car. Flavors I tried: Coffee Toffee - I have a weak spot for coffee flavored ice cream and this one hits the spot. The balance of coffee ice cream and toffee crunch is wonderful! Salted Caramel - By far my FAVORITE flavor here. Where can I get salted caramel ice cream in Orange County?!?! Ricanela - cinnamon and snickerdoodle cookies! If you love snickerdoodles (which I do), you must try this one. Honey Lavender - I'm going to admit that this isn't a favorite of mine. A little too flowery for me, but I heard that this is an acquired taste. I ended up getting 2 scoops in the smallest cup of Coffee Toffee and Salted Caramel. I scraped up every little bit. I'm drooling just thinking about it now. I love how they use silverware as taster spoons so we aren't adding those little plastic spoons to the landfills. Cups are biodegradable too. Earth conscious bunch here. :) Lovin' the friendly service and interestingly tasty flavors. You gotta try it!

Let me start off by saying that the ice cream itself deserves 5 stars. BUT, i'd say there are other aspects that are lacking. My boyfriend and I came around 8:00 p.m. on a Sunday night and luckily, there was no wait.  But even no one else in the shop, the employees behind the counter were rushing us with our ice cream selection.  This being the first time trying Bi-Rite, I was really excited to try out some different flavors.  My boyfriend and I each asked for one sample and the guy serving us hesitantly gave us a small sample.  We weren't convinced/set on the first samples that we tried, and we were planning on getting several scoops, so we figured we could try at least one more sample.  The guy serving us then gave us a semi-dirty look, making us feel bad for asking for another sample.  How ridiculous is that?  There wasn't even any one else in the store.  Anyway, he did give our requested samples and then we decided that we wanted a triple scoop. This is where things got complicated.  So here, they don't measure ice cream in scoops.  They measure by sizes.  We asked for three scoops, we didn't realize that they don't do "scoops," and so the guy then responded rudely "single or double."  We didn't know what this meant until we took a step back and re-read the menu.  So, pretty much, you can order a kid's size, single size or double size ice cream.  And within each order, you may try 2-3 flavors.  Anyway, since we were sharing the 3 "scoops" we decided to get the double, to get more ice cream. However, the serving was really small and we were really not impressed by the service.   Overall, I would not come back unless one of my friends insisted on coming here.  Ice cream should be fun, and the employee here ruined that for me.  I'd rather go to mitchells, where there is a parking lot and much larger scoops. Notes: -Parking can be difficult.  I circled the area a couple of times and then got lucky. -Semi-small scoops.

This is the BEST ice-cream place!!!  I bring every single guest from out of town here and they rave about it as well.  The service is patchy as some servers are very nice, and others can be rude.  I am usually a chocolate ice-cream lover, but this place turned me a lover for salted caramel!  Try the salted caramel with pistachio's - sounds strange but it is the perfect crunch and just perfect.  The ricanelas is yummy cinnamon goodness as well.  The biggest issue is the line- but if you are with a friend its worth the wait!  Don't make the mistake of seeing the shorter line for the soft serve bi-rite store next door and going there.  Not the same experience at all!  Also keep in mind that they charge extra if you "eat in" versus "take out."

If I'd ordered only a scoop of Roasted Banana and walked away I'd have given this place 4 stars. Rich, creamy, dense and nicely accented with sticky banana bits. Very true flavor. (And I'm not even a fan of banana anything.) But then I ordered the messed up sorbet. The pineapple tangerine flavor was unremarkable. The texture was off. Was "dry" and crumbled into...crumbly pieces. Perhaps this is why they only had one sorbet on the menu (not including the one granita)? Summer's a better season for fruit and ice anyhow so they've some time to improve. I'll root for them. In the mean time, my suggestion, Bi-Rite: don't put it out if it ain't rite. I ordered a second ice cream flavor - the honey lavender - and Bi-Rite Creamery somewhat regained my favor (but just about wiped my wallet clean...that's another thing.) The not so subtle lavender flavor was a plus for me, and it was fairly creamy but still inferior in texture to the roasted banana (and the salted caramel which I sampled) in texture. What I really liked, besides the Roasted Banana: -- the environmentally conscious  servingware (from the biodegradeable bowls to the metal tasting spoons -- the "Hot Chocolate Drink of the Day" (way to respect this winter beverage, thank you!) -- the use of local, Strauss organic dairy products -- the friendly girl who served me -- the sundaes and "toppings of the day" Definitely deserving of another try. Unfortunately the prices prohibit enjoying more than a couple flavors at once. Although it seems to go against all good sense and decency to serve the honey lavender alongside the ginger anyway, doesn't it. Update: Salted caramel - 4 stars chocolate - 3 stars Fairfax scoop has this place beat, for sure.

YET another place to wait but it is totally worth it! Let's just first clear this up...I honestly was debating if i should give this place a 4 or a 5 star but I end up giving it a 5 because I want to say this is my favorite ice cream place. They have different flavors everyday but they always have a few that is going to be on menu no matter what. Today I had the something pecan ice cream and coffee toffee and both of them was amazing! I didn't even think about coffee toffee because I tried it last time and instantly FELL IN LOVE. I don't know how they do it but there is no other places that compare to what Bi-rite has to offer in terms of this ice cream. :) It's just amazing. The pecan ice cream was pretty darn good as well. Don't listen to what i have to say...JUST COME HERE AND TRY IT AND GET WHATEVER FLAVOR YOU WANT OR OF COURSE TRY OUT THE FLAVORS FIRST AND THEN GET IT :)

Over 3,000 reviews... are you kidding me? Dang this place gets around! Apparently, the line that I waited in to get my ice cream was pretty small to what they usually have... so go expecting to wait, but what you get at the end of that wait is well worth it. They have interesting flavors such as salted caramel, honey lavender, brown sugar with ginger caramel, etc. However, don't let these unique flavors deter you. Not only are they quite spectacular... Bi-Rite also lets you ask for a sample taste of flavors before you pick the one you want. Definitely a "must visit" if you're in SF!

The perfect pairing to a beautiful day at Dolores Park: delicious ice cream. I have only been here once, but I can't wait to be back. I had the roasted banana and balsamic strawberry ice cream. Banana ice-cream can be tricky; I have tried some that tasted too artificial and others that were too thick and overwhelming. Bi-Rite; however, does it right. The banana is indeed the star, but the taste and aroma of the ripe bananas are not overwhelming. I also really liked the balsamic strawberry. Unlike other strawberry ice-cream, this one wasn't very sweet. There is a subtle bite to it (perhaps the balsamic vinegar?). At any rate, this one has has a unique taste. I also tried the minneola popsicle. I really liked this too because the popsicle is made with the fresh fruit and more or less tastes just like a fresh minneola. All in all, a superb first experience.

Tucked on a side street near Dolores Park, Bi-Rite is a bit secluded from clear eyesight.  This tiny little shop occupies only enough seating for three and their cabinet of assorted flavors so expect to grub outside. They have a wide selection of ice cream and sorbet.  The presentation of their goods is similar to that of a gelato shop's.  I constantly had to remind myself that it was ice cream instead of gelato.  They allow for sampling with their own metal tasting spoons, yet I always just go for the kill. There are several people there to help you.  As I went to order a guy taps me on the shoulder.  Wahhh?  What's getting in my way of dessert?! "Hey I was here in front of you", a man begrudgingly states. "Duhhh, I came in here with her??", I reply as I point to the lady with a stroller and three kids.  I had opened the door for this lady talking on her cell phone while pushing her cart of kids.  I had even let this lady order before me and now this guy was tapping on my shoulder?  How impatiently could this guy be?  There were two servers and only two people in front of him!  Anyways... I ordered plum sorbet and orange cardamom in single cup ($3.25, pretty standard fare for gourmet ice cream).  The plum tasted like it was straight out of a starburst packet.  It was good, just not great.  The plum flavor wasn't that discernible mostly because it was overrun with sweetness.  It was so sweet that it slightly burned the back of my palette. As for the orange cardamom...oooh yeah.  This flavor was sooo good.  It was creamy and luscious.  I wouldn't mind going for a cup of this by itself. ___ A tiny gourmet ice cream shop with interesting flavors.  A friend of mine tells me that most of the flavors are really saturated and deep, so I maybe pre-tasting would be a good idea. -Does it have enough to distinguish itself from other shops? A: Not sure?  I guess you'll have to visit to find out.

oo how I love my late night trips to B-rite with the roomie - always a great respite from a hard day or hot, muggy weather. And what place isn't great when it constantly has a line outside the door? My favorite combos so far: Snickerdoodle and Ginger. That's after attempting on several trips to find something that went with Ginger and one of the friendly employees gave me a delicatible sample of this. The Mexican Chocolate is also quite scrumptious when paired with salted caramel and the Lavendar Honey an out of this world deja vu moment that sends me soaring back to memories of Lavendar ice cream at the foot of Mount Fuji  when I lived in Japan. Time to start buying pints....the drive is getting expensive....

I have a girl crush on this cutie who blogs on http://mashiso.tumblr.co… and she mostly posts on food. She seems to know food very well, and she's kind of filled the void Yelp has with "secret" gems. I tend to get myself stuck in a rut with where to eat, or I frequent the same place too much. She was talking about this thing called 7x7 (which i believe is a bay area foodie mag), and their 100 places to eat challenge. The salty caramel icecream was listed, and I decided to give it a try. Don't let the long line discourage you, these people know how to get it moving! I was the 25th in line and I got my stuff within 5-10 minutes. Not bad. Salty Caramel : Don't let the name fool you either. It's not salty. It tastes like straight up liquid caramel. Yum. Lavender: Tastes like flowers. Stay away from this is you'd prefer to wear florals than taste it. Cookies and cream: My bf had this and he loved it. All flavors had a super smooth consistency. I can't wait to try all other flavors. If you'd like to just take a pint home, you can skip the line and let them know. Bathroom keys are at the register btw. Service is great!

Stood in the line for close to 45 minutes. That alone would have annoyed me but it was nice and sunny and I had basked in Dolores park for a few hours so I was in no hurry as such. I tried the salted caramel and the almond fudge while the hubby tried orange cardamom, malted vanilla and brown sugar. Of course I got to taste! The salted caramel was nice but nothing spectacular. I liked all the flavours but I dont think they knocked my socks off. Maybe i ll try other flavors next time. I prefer Humphry Slocombe, to be honest! There... I said it!!

HONEY LAVENDER. HONEY LAVENDER. Sounds weird since it's a plant, but it's so good. I'm in class right now (and writing yelp reviews) and can only think about HONEY LAVENDER. So good. Love it. Get it. Pricey, but good for real ice cream. Seating inside is limited, but who cares when you have honey lavender ice cream? Bathroom available, but requires you to hold a big spatula (or was it a whisk?) with the key on it. Doesn't look very sexy, but who cares when you have honey lavender ice cream? Earl grey and salty caramel are both good too. Pick mandarin orange if you want something more fruity/sorbet-y. Good consistency.

This was my 2nd time at bi-rite. I got the coffee toffee sundae. It was "A-OK" . It wasn't really anything TOO special (just what I had thought at my first visit with whatever I had ordered), but it was  still good. I think i've officially decided I'm a Mitchell's Ice Cream kind of girl. Parking isn't all that great in this area, but thats what you expect in sf already. The line usually curves around the corner, but it more fairly quickly. This place is worth a try, but it's not my all time fave.

Being an ice cream lover, my friends brought me to Bi-Rite Creamery on a busy Saturday night. It took about 30 minutes to reach the front, but it was well worth the wait. The ice cream *is* as good as they say! I had the single: coffee toffee and salted caramel. And, yes, because I didn't know when I would be back again (I live an hour away) and because the fudge is homemade *and* because I love fudge, I added hot fudge to my order. One word sums it up: divine. The ice cream is creamy without being too heavy. Even though everything tasted sweet, their own flavor notes came through loud and clear. A must try for everyone. I dare say even for the lactose intolerant!

Lucky for me I don't have much of a sweet tooth, as this place is only a few blocks away.  The flavours are so inventive and delicious you can't not love it.  Everyone working there is so nice, even to the point that you don't feel bad asking for more than one taste.  It's so hard to choose!!! When available, I get my beloved Balsamic Strawberry.

Wow, over 1200 reviews?!  What can I possibly say that hasn't been said?  Probably little! I'll just note that I had a two-scoop cup today consisting of ricanela (snickerdoodle) and toasted banana, which ended up being a delicious combo.  Kinda small size for two scoops, but it actually satisfied me perfectly.  Certainly creamy and sweet, but not too cloyingly sweet, and the texture of the toasted banana (with bits of crunchy dried banana) was perfect! And despite the gorgeous warm weather in SF today, my friend and I waited less than 5 minutes for our ice cream (at 1:15pm on a Sunday). So, with all this deliciousness, why not five stars?  Well, I save five-star ratings for super-exceptional places... with surprising ambiance, impressive generosity (e.g., donating a large percentage of profits to charity), amazingly cheap prices, etc.  Bi-rite merely offers really yummy ice cream next to an attractive park, so -- while impressive and much appreciated -- just misses out on that 5th star.

Dear yelp journal, It feels odd to me to review an ice cream shop because it seems like something that shouldn't be reviewed, kind of like reviewing a gas station or something.  However, this place really deserves kudos.  If my opinion isn't enough, ask the other ten+ people waiting in line and the other members of their party sitting in their cars waiting for their "chosen one" to deliver the goods. First off, I saw that cheesie movie with Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin "It's Complicated" and they were eating honey lavender ice cream.  I thought to myself, "Wow, that sounds really interesting, and I'd like to try that."  After having a delicious brunch, my gal pals wanted to come here for dessert, as it was a particularly sunny and beautiful day.  We spent forever looking for parking (someone even backed into my car to try to squeeze into a parking spot - something to note if you're driving here.  Parking sucks).   We got into line and the shop willingly gives you samples of the flavors once you get inside.  The line moves quickly.  They have a menu on the wall outside the door, so you can decide what you want to speed up the process or have some samples once you get in.  Very efficient. I saw their menu and they had HONEY LAVENDER.  It was like one of those moments where it felt like "The Secret" actually works.  Putting a wish into the universe and having it get granted. Once tasted, it was POWERFULLY lavender.  Might not be so great for people who associate lavender with soap.  I had it paired off with the earl grey, which I think is sweet and neutral enough that it would be a great base to mix with any flavor.  It's even good enough to have just by itself.  I wouldn't have minded. Anyway, the price is a little bit high, but the quality is totally worth it.  The ice cream is creamy, rich in flavor, and the workers there are super nice and polite.  If it weren't so good, I probably would not have spent the time reviewing it.

I'm a fan of local businesses and I make it a point to only eat at these types of establishments. Bi-Rite is no exception. The family who owns Bi-Rite Market across the street branched out and opened this place a while back. Who can resist? The lines are always out the door and sometimes even onto Dolores. That MUST be a good sign right? Anyway, I've been stopping by here for years now, ever since I was introduced to all of its deliciousness. There are many original flavors, one that I like in particular is Lavender. They sell premade ice cream sandwiches, cakes, and pints/quarts located in their freezer. There's also an assortment of chocolate fudges and ice cream scoops/products. Overall, the prices here are higher than say, Baskin Robins, but hey, that's what you pay for quality! If you're just going to buy a premade ice cream sandwich or something from the freezer, just go ahead and grab what you want. You can pay directly at the cashier instead of having to wait in line with all the others. I expect this place to be busy busy busy this summer!

What's the hype with this place anyway? I love the theme and the decor and the fabulous staff, but, the ever so popular salted caramel ice cream was simply mediocre! There's no place like home for ice cream in San Francisco!  That home is Mitchell's Ice Cream....trust me,  I'm a SF native and we've been in the Mission since 1966!!

I LOVE Bi-Rite.  Mmmmmm.  I can never say no, even if I'm really full from dinner. Not like this place really needs another long, 5-star review, so I'll just keep it short and tell you my favorite things about this place: 1) Ricanelas = cinnamon ice cream + snickerdoodle cookie pieces.  Absolutely my favorite ice cream flavor EVER.  And that's saying a lot! 2) The line last night was only just outside the door and to the first window...shortest I've ever seen it!  So I guess the moral of the story is...go to Bi-Rite when it's really cold outside on a Friday night around 9:45pm...but there still may be a line.  It's just that good. :) 3) Sam's Sundae = chocolate ice cream with bergamot olive oil drizzle + sea salt.  A-maz-ing!  Was featured on the Food Network's "Best thing I ever ate," and so my friend and I were curious and gave it a try.  Oh man..soooooooo good.  Sounds weird, I know, but try it and you won't be disappointed! 3) Salted caramel is also delicious...I tried this the first couple times I came here.  But it's hard to eat more than a few bites of, for me.  And I've since discovered ricanelas, so there's just no question anymore. ;)   4) All their other flavors are delicious too, and I usually try 1 or 2 before getting my standard ricanelas. Bi-Rite, you will always be worth the wait!

I came here on a cold day and the line was not too long. About 10 people in front of us. I heard many good things about this place and finally got to try it. I got the single cup with 2 different flavors - the Honey Lavender and the Salted Caramel. I don't think I've tasted any ice cream this good. It's creamy but not heavy. The flavor is so true to the name - the lavender was heavenly and the honey was sweet. Lavender is definitely an acquired taste and they did a good job of incorporating it with the honey. The balance with the salted caramel was just perfect - the salty with the sweet worked well together. Even though the weather was freezing and my face and hands were ice-sicles; this smooth and creamy dessert made me feel like I was on cloud 9. "Now, why did I wait so long to try this place?" I keep asking myself. Next time I won't wait so long to come back again.

"Corporation vs. Mom and Pop" Hip quaint cute little ice cream shop.  The neighborhood just got a little brighter!  I followed and went with the reviews... Its true the "Salted Caramel" is all that they claim it to be.  Deee-licious!! i had a sample of that and the Soy Chocolate.  Immediately i bought a pint of both.  The lady behind the counter was one of the owners, and was so friendly.  (looks like all the ice cream is made on the premises) She even provided me with a freezer bag to keep the ice cream from melting too fast.  Its the little things at these unique places that keep me coming back.  Something that the BigCorps cant replicate; Personality and Character. *ima have kids just to get them icecream here!*

Bi-Rite is a cute ice cream shop that offers interesting flavors that you probably can't find anywhere else. We got the salted caramel, honey lavendar, and ricanelas (cinnamon ice cream with bits of snickerdoodle). Salted caramel, although the most popular flavor, was my least favorite of the three. It was just too strong for me! After eating it for awhile, my throat actually felt a little sore/scratchy. Ricanelas was EXCELLENT though. Overall: Bi-Rite is cool to try for its crazy flavors, but the taste of the ice cream is still questionable.

It was hot as hell and I needed a refreshment.   I finally decided to check out the Yelp legend, the Bi-Rite Creamery. The place is small and the people here are nice.  A little too nice. Took a look at the menu and landed on the Coffee Toffee sundae.   It was sweet, too sweet.  TOO DAMN SWEET! I'll give it another shot when I'm in a shittier mood.

If this place ever gets rid of Ricanela (cinnamon ice cream that's LOADED w/ snickerdoodle cookie pieces), I will have a MAAAAY-JA meltdown.   I know some people complain about the long line, but I don't mind it.  As long as I'm w/ good company, the line moves pretty fast and it helps build up my excitedness and anticipation for what I know is about to come.... INSANELY GOOD ICE CREAM. True story: As it was finally my turn at the front of the line, the Bi Rite worker asked me what I'd like to order... I blurted out w/ enthusiasm, "One QUART of Ricanela, please."  A tad surprised by such a tall order, he asked, "Any thing else for you, ma'am?".  To which I responded still equally excited.... "And a VERY large spoon!!"   Minus 1 star for the quart costing me $14 freakin' 99, which in turn prevents me from being able to afford such an indulgence on a more frequent basis.

Ok I am the biggest ice cream fan in the world! Seriously just ask anyone who know me.  This place has always been the spot people keep telling me about that I absolutely MUST try.  So I did and got the 2 flavahs: Strawberry balsamic: Had crunchy  ice crystals and not enough strawberry nor balsamic flavor.  The color of the ice cream was a faint pink! if I were to rename this ice cream I would call it "the light pink ice crunch" Salted caramel: Had better...this too had ice cruchies!

I've been wanting to come here for a long time. I finally had my chance one night when walking around the mission after my friend's birthday dinner. It was a pleasant surprise that we just so happened to come across this place. We were already pretty tipsy from some sangria from Cha Cha Cha so we didn't mind waiting in line for a little, and of course...we had the drunken munchies. I was pleasantly surprised with the variety of flavors, both traditional and not-so-traditional.  I opted for the snickerdoodle and cookies and cream (apparently I was in a really fatty mood) on a cone. The snickerdoodle was especially delicious! Cookies and cream was pretty standard. But the cone was just...ehh....a cone. Let me forewarn you, I'm biased to another ice cream place. If you haven't already made your way across the bridge to the East Bay, go to Berkeley and try Ici. I swear it won't disappoint. And, once you have a handmade cone at Ici you will never be satisfied by Bi-rite's. Sorry, but it's just the plain facts of life. Bi-rite is not bad at all, it's quite delicious. But, try Ici sometime...I'm just sayin.

A definite gem! With non-traditional flavors like lavender and salted caramel and earl grey... its definitely out of my comfort zone for my comfort snack. I find myself having cravings for these unique flavors. Mine personally is the ginger ice cream... I am a BIG ginger fan but this ginger flavor isn't overpowering. What else is a must try is the sundaes... yum-um! Oh... and did I mention its organic for all you organic fans out there. As for the store itself, the place is a bit small, but quaint, cute and reminds of a 50's mom and pop ice cream shop. A definite must-try in the city!

Salted Caramel Ice Cream. If you could write a four word review that would summarize how good this place is that would be it. Those four words describe an experience. This is not a food, this is not a dessert, it's the best ice cream anywhere. I have yet to taste a bad flavor and I have to say it's just flat out sensational. Great ingredients, friendly employees and an atmosphere of awesomeness make this one of the best spots in the Mission. Enjoy!

Over 2000 Yelp reviews and 4.5 stars?  That already says a lot about this place. Bi-Rite is my favorite ice-cream place of all time.  Snicker doodle, Toasted Coconut, Cinnamon Swirl and Honey Lavender are some of my favorite flavors.   Doesn't matter what time of day or what time of year, there is always a line out the door.  Despite this...the staff seems always willing to provide samples (I always felt bad about asking for samples with so many people in line behind me) and they never make you feel rushed.  Great place to stop by after spending the day at Dolores Park across the street.   Bonus points:  They use recycled products for their spoons, bowls, and napkins.

Mmm salted caramel and honey lavender.   I finally got a chance to visit this joint that everyone talks about and how its better than Humphry.  Luckily when i went, the line wasnt out the door.  The servers seem to be really nice and cheerful so i didnt feel as bad in asking to try out some flavors.   The salted caramel was yummy!  Tasted like burnt sugar in a way.  The honey lavender was definitely different.  Who wouldve thought, a smelly fragrance for ice cream was pretty good. On top of all that, you get a stamp card!  I dont know if its just me but.. stamp cards is like an incentive that makes me want to go back so they can stamp more!

Finally, after 5+ years of living in the city and telling myself I will stand in the ridiculously long line @ bi-rite to see what all the hype is about, we finally went there today to check off one more item on the EAT SF list (salted caramel ice cream- TO DIE FOR!) I'm a big fan of Haagen Daz's Fleur De Sal Carmel Ice Cream, which is what I was expecting the Salted Caramel to taste like.... NOT the case!  It actually reminded me of Rechuitti's burnt caramel chocolate... (!!!!!!)  Delicious... will definitely BE BACK! Tip:  If your in a rush, they have an express line for pre-packaged pints in the store... the line was pretty empty, if I knew sooner, I would have just bought the pint and chilled in dolores park on this sunny sunday afternoon.

Last weekend I finally decided to see what all this hype over BiRite was about. So I stood in line for about 15-20 minutes and pretended I was a Mission Transplant Hipster. I had a single scoop of the Coffee Toffee. I really enjoyed that there were bits of coffee grinds. However, it was a little more expensive than I wanted to pay. I'm used to a gourmet cone costing about $2.65 or so, but over $3? Plus, the scoop was not very generous. BiRite definitely has decadent and complimentary flavors. I like it better than PollyAnn's, but it may take a few more visits to make me switch from being a Mitchell's fan. BiRite is for the person with a sophisticated palate. Imagine the type of ice cream you would receive for dessert as a sampler at a fancy restaurant.  In short, however,  I probably wouldn't make a trip to the Mission just for the ice cream.

My first visit to Bi-Rite, it was 20 minutes before closing on a Saturday night and there were tons of people STILL in line. I didn't mind the line at all though because it was one of the most interesting lines I've ever had to stand in. There were drunks and crazies who were out for movie night at the park in Dolores Park and I got a chance to hear strange convos in that line. Good times! The line went by quick and I ordered the honey lavender & salted caramel. This was not a combination that I liked. I just didn't like the honey lavender, it just tasted, weeell...flowery. I did like the salted caramel and I do understand why everyone raves about it. Sometimes that bit of sweetness and saltyness hits you in all the right spots! We also tried the ginger ice cream and liked it. If you're brave enough, try it! Writing this review just made me salivate over Bi-Rite but they're closed at the moment. Damn.

I didn't actually visit the place. A friend of mine brought a pint of their Honey Lavender to my house just an hour ago and I tried it  for the first time. It smelled heavenly. But alas it was way stronger than I had imagined it to be. I guess I'll have to go there and look at their flavors and try something different and see. Honey Lavender: HUGE lavender scent and flavor, quite overpowering by my standards.

I tried this place, skeptical at first, thinking that it was just a tourist-y place (I grew up in the city). BUT, the salted caramel really wowed me. I had tried this flavor at Molly Moon's in Seattle, and found it too strong after 3 bites. Bi-Rite gets it right- smooth, light, balanced! I also tried Ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles)- smelled great and the first 5 bites were delicious, but after that I got tired of it. If it weren't so far from me, I'd come more often. But for now I'll stick to Marco Polo and Polly Ann's!

IF YOU LOVE ICE CREAM, THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU! As a visitor to San Francisco, this was my second visit to Bi-Rite! The first time I came, I got Salted Caramel and Peppermint - delicious! My fellow tourist really enjoyed their fruit popsicles that he bought 3! Another friend ordered a Sam's Sundae and the lady that helped us was so kind as to split it into two flavors! After such a great first impression and the quality of service, I made sure to make another visit here when I was in San Francisco again. This time I got Salted Caramel (again) and Cherry Vanilla. It was delicious, but I thought the SC/Peppermint combo was better (next Christmas!). Bi-Rite never fails to satisfy your ice cream cravings! :)

Like everyone else on this: SALTED CARAMEL!  Savory and creamy.  I can definetely taste the salt and caramel.  Really rich flavors.  I've tried other salted caramel ice creams: Scoops and Carmela's in LA, and this one is by far the best. We also tried the honey salt.  It was ok.  Definetely wasn't as flavorful or rich but worth trying.   Service was quick for a line that went out the door.  In and out in 10 minutes but that was because we scarfed down our delicious ice cream. Too bad you're 300 miles away!  I will return someday.

Pretty darn good. I'm a fan. I've tried: Coffee Toffee, Roasted Banana, Strawberry Balsamic, Honey Lavender. Everything tastes...exactly what its name implies. If you order Roasted Banana, don't expect some artificial flavored bright yellow ball of ice cream. Expect, well, banana. But, the king of ice cream in the world is still Mövenpick. Long live the king

Ok, I'll admit, I didn't really know what all the hype was about the first time or two I had Bi-Rite.  I certainly didn't understand the lines out the door nearly every night or why people were willing to fight for parking to come here. My last 3 visits, though, have made me see the light.  It's true, Bi-Rite is exceptionally delicious!  With a healthy offering of unique flavors, a changing menu, and unrivaled creaminess, I understand why people are crazy about this place.  Not to mention that all the ice cream is made on site - how cool is that? Here are my favs: Roasted Banana - 5/5 - Probably my favorite!  Unlike a lot of banana ice creams, there is nothing at all artificial-tasting about Bi-Rite's roasted banana.  It's just the right amount of flavor and sweetness. Orange Cardamom - 5/5 - I'm a fiend for cardamom.  I absolutely love the stuff and was destroyed when Bombay Ice Creamery closed its doors a few months ago.  SO glad Bi-Rite has this in the mix!  It's delicious like Bombay's, but even creamier.  I was a little hesitant about the orange, but you can't even really taste it.   Toasted Coconut - 4/5 - Delicious coconut ice cream!  Actually, probably some of the best coconut ice cream I've had.  Minus a star only because it lacks that wow factor of some of the other flavors. Here are the other flavors I've tried: Brown Sugar and Ginger - I'm not going to give this a star rating because the reason I disliked this is unfair.  I hate ginger.  I am a ginger-hound and can detect even trace amounts of ginger in food.  It's a curse.  BUT, the bf was blown away by this flavor and absolutely loved it, even though he doesn't much care for ginger either.  So as long as you don't hate ginger, you may love it too. Salted Caramel - I know people are crazy for this stuff, but I didn't love it.  Hundreds of people can't really be wrong though, so I'd at least try it.

ummm whaaat this place has the most ridiculous line (although i think diddy riese has a longer one) So....interesting flavors. I enjoyed the spoonful of basil that I tried, but wasn't sure if I liked it enough to eat a whole scoop of it. The honey lavender was a bit too flowery for my taste, but it was nice. I ended up getting a kids sized cone of salted caramel ice cream and it definitely was worth it. The initial lick tasted kinda weird, but it got better and better. The waffle cone was really good too! I wouldn't say this is the best ice cream I've ever had, but I see the appeal of being a repeat customer. I'll be back to try more!

I didn't feel like venturing out of my comfort zone so I got the coffee toffee and mint chip, which were both awesome but my friend's salted caramel just hit it out of the park. the cinnamon ice cream w/ snickerdoodles was also pretty indulgent. mmmmmmmmmmm. get 2 scoops of whatever floats your boat and sit among the happy people at Dolores Park on a sunny day = formula for a good time.

Charge up your portable DVD player or bring your Kindle.  This place has LONG lines.  For a reason!  I believe I've once waited about 45 minutes for a a 2-scooper of roasted banana and toasted coconut ice cream.  Insane?  Probably about as insane as the amazing creaminess and flavor that will hit your tongue after the wait.  Afterwards, take your ice cream up the street to Dolores Park (if it'll last that long), and enjoy an amazing view of the city. It's worth it if you're in the mood.  And personally, I'm always in the mood.  The best ice cream in SF I've had so far.

After three years in the city and countless trips to DP, I freaking FINALLY tried The Bi-Rite Ice Cream this week.  About time! I don't know how this never happened before. I don't buy into hype easily, but I don't avoid it like the plague either.  Therefore, I have no rational explanation for why my mouth and Bi-Rite ice cream have never made sweet, sweet love until this week. This story takes place on a Friday around 6pm.  My friends and I had to wait in line for approximately 7 minutes.  The wait went something like this: 0 min: I'm being a party pooper, going, "Ehhh, I don't know if I really want ice cream." 2 min: Jealously watching a couple with a dog eating their cones outside.  The guy had pistachios sprinkled over his cone, and one of the nuts on the side of the cone that was furthest from his face starts melting down the side of the cone.  Life slows to slow motion.  The pistachio is dangling 1mm above his pinky finger, threatening to fall at any second. 3 min: "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!" I scream (in that deep slo-mo voice) as this guy's pistachio falls off his cone and onto his dog's head.  The dog maneuvers the nut into his mouth and swallows. 4 min: We reach the storefront, which has menus displayed in the window.  "OH MY GOD I have GOT to have this," I say, pointing to honey-lavender ice cream on the menu. 5 min: "OH MY GOD I have GOT to have this," I say, pointing to earl grey ice cream on the menu. 6 min: "OH MY GOD I have GOT to have this," I say, pointing to salted caramel ice cream on the menu. 7 min: "OH MY GOD I have GOT to have this," I say, pointing to roasted banana ice cream on the menu.   I walk out with a cone of earl grey & honey lavender (I'll spare you the details of how difficult it was to decide on two flavors).  It was divine.  I want to go swimming in a pool of the honey lavender ice cream. I'm not normally a fan of lavender, but the honey tones down its slight bitterness, so it's just this heavenly honey-flower-tasting thing with a nice tea aftertaste.   I slurp it up all over the place, it melts all over my hands, I lick my hands although that is gross, proclaim it the best cone of ice cream ever, and die happy. Then I come back to life to write this Yelp review.

Been here a couple of times and it is definitely solid ice cream. Obviously a little pricey, you can probably save some money if you're going to share with someone and just get a pint to enjoy at Dolores. Not a fan of chocolate ice cream, I love that everything isn't a variation of chocolate this or that. Their salted caramel is definitely worth trying but I'm a super fan of the balsamic strawberry flavor and the creme fraiche. Their flavors are clean and flavorful with a great consistency (melts a little fast though) so come and catch it when there's a short line.

Over-rated. Flavors I've tried: Salted caramel - good; a little too sweet for my palate Mint chip - super creamy and not as minty as expected Balsalmic strawberry - more bland in taste than expected; mellow flavor satisfying my tastebuds Last summer I had a bright red ice cream flavor. It was some sort of sorbet I believe.  Wished I knew the flavor though.. It was the best I've had from Bi-Rite. Fa sho this flavor is a must have, right here!

Very interesting flavor combinations. Had the strawberry balsamic and it was pretty decent. Expect very long lines and minimal seating areas. All in all, I'm okay about the place. Wasn't blown away. Maybe I should've gotten another flavor.

Wow, great ice creamy.  They make good ice creamy, lots of cream and the flavors are unique but good.  I enjoyed the Toasted Coconut and the Creme Fresh.  The scope sizes are small, so be prepared to go back for more.  The place is small with one table inside and benches outside.  The line moves fast and they give you samples since the flavors are unique. A must try, of the other side of the Bi-Rite grocery store.

Went to Bi-Rite Creamery for the first time with the S.O. yesterday afternoon, and now I can attest to all the rave about this place! Man oh maaaan, it is amazingly delicious! When we arrived, the line curved around the corner, but we were prepared to wait an hour or more just to try it. Thankfully, though, the line moved pretty fast! We probably ordered within 30 minutes of waiting in line. If you've been to Ici in Berkeley, it's got nothing on Bi-Rite. Although they both have unique flavors, the wait for Ici isn't really worth it that much compared to that of Bi-Rite. Ici ice cream has a more light and "icy" texture, while Bi-Rite ice cream has a smoother and creamer texture. Depending on what you like, both places are great. Anyways, back t Bi-Rite! We ordered a "single" size with Cherry-Raspberry Sorbet and Peach Ginger as well as a "double" size with Honey Lavender, Peach Ginger, and Salted Caramel in cups rather than cones. When I tasted the double size, I thought it was heavenly, but if you add their candied peanuts and walnuts, it tasted BEYOND heavenly (if that's even possible, haha). The salty and sweet combination is an orgasmic blast in your mouth that tickles your taste buds like no other. The Cherry-Raspberry Sorbet is amazing as well. I loved the tangy bite it has to it coupled with the more mild taste of the Peach Ginger. A great palate cleanser, in my opinion. Definitely worth the trip to SF and wait in line. If you're driving, there should be plenty of street parking a block or so away! Plan on going again to try out all the other flavors they have to offer.

Hmmm.  261 Yelp reviews for Pizzeria Delfina; 261 Yelp reviews for Bi-Rite Creamery. Coincidence?  I think not.  Perhaps we weren't the only diners who had two desserts...   My second scoop of honey lavender this week.  Please don't make me say which was better.   The bottom line:  Try Sam's Sundae, with citrus olive oil and sea salt!   ERF

I decided to check out this place because of it's high rated reviews here and WOW. This place has Awesome Homemade Ice Cream. They have a variety of unique flavors including what might be my favorite, coffee flavored ice cream with toffee bits. They serve the ice cream with lil wooden spoons and have some seats inside as well as a bench under the trees right outside the place. Highly recommend this place. This is definitely my new favorite Ice Cream go to place in the city.

I usually have staples, especially when it comes to ice cream places. At the neighborhood Thrifty's (now Rite Aid) when growing up, it was Chocolate Malted Crunch or Rainbow Sherbet on a warm So-Cal day. At Marcie's and Kelly's Korner, the two local ice cream parlors, it was Cookies n' Cream all the way. But at Bi-Rite, there's just too many good flavors to choose from. I was first told to try the Salted Caramel, which was awesome. And then I discovered the Honey Lavender and the Balsamic Strawberry. Yum and yum. It really depends on my mood that day or the weather, but you really can't go wrong. Kudos for the inventive, paradoxical flavors. Who knew?

Damn. Seriously, almost every time I try to walk past 18th street, I find myself turning down towards Dolores Park to get an ice cream cone. My favorite combo is the Masala Orange and Lavender flavors, but if I'm feeling decadent I'll get Toffee Coffee and Peanut Butter fudge. Toffee Coffee ice cream. Of all the sets of 2 flavors that rhyme with each other, Toffee Coffee is my favorite. And the coffee is from Ritual.

My fave ice cream spot on the west coast. Bi-rite makes delectable, organic, homemade, creamy ice cream. Some of my favorites are... 1) Coffee Toffee (Tastes exactly like gourmet java!) 2) Cherry Almond (Real big cherry chunks and lots of almonds) 3) Honey Lavender 4) Salted Caramel (but can only have so much... as the name states- it's salty) The Mint Choc Chip was good, but pretty average compared to the rest of their offerings. Can't wait to try the Balsamic Strawberry and Mexican Chocolate flavor when I go back!

Um, I used to think the line out of here was cause it's good. But no. I've had better dryers icecream than this. Though it's true, they dont do seasonal sea salt whatever and icecream that tastes like trader joes hand soap. Trust me- I love exotic floral icecream (see my Bombay review or Marianne's), but handsoap- not at this price.

Fresh, uniquely delicious ice cream served up by friendly hipsters in the Mission? Hell yeah! My favorite has to be the salted caramel. I tend to never diverge from the norm, but today I got the malted vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate. To die for. Nice to see that Bi-Rite is going to be expanding their space. Although, it is quite fun to hang outside and people watch too...

HOT DAMN this stuff is good...and I'm not even that big of an ice cream fan. I don't know what they put in it, but the ice cream is perfect.  Flavors are unique and dynamic; you can find sweet sweet caramel goodness or less sugary ones.  We'd been driving for a while and stopped by on a cold, rainy day, so there was no line!!  Let me just say that the sugar rush the ice cream bring on warms your insides, so don't be afraid to try it in 40 degree weather =) We got there hungry and were happily stuffed with their regular size by the time we walked out.  I did like the salted caramel ice cream, but  not as much as the die hard fans, so I would only get 1/2 scoop of it next time.  My favorite was the Ricanelas.  Thankfully this place is an hour away from me, or I'd be there on a regular basis.  Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!

Ice cream is such a wonderful thing and it's great to see a place like Bi-Rite Creamery doing it with passion and class. When I was visiting SF my friends took me out to this place and I was blown away by the great flavor of the frozen cream scooped into my cone. It was pretty crowded when I went but the line went by pretty fast and it's well worth the wait. Final Thoughts: Not much to say other than if you're ever in SF check this place out. It's a classic treat done extremely well.

Sunny Sunday in SF.  Managed to avoid the long lines by going right around lunchtime.  Afterwards, headed to Dolores Park to sit among the crazies.  After I ate the ice cream, fell asleep happy. Earl Grey - personal favorite Ricanelas  (cinnamon w/snickerdoodles) - so good Honey Lavender - I usually dislike anything lavendar but this scored high

Any time I'm in the mission, I always make it a point to come to Bi Rite.  It isn't like any other ice cream I've had before.  All their flavors are so original and unique that makes me always come back here.  You can try as many flavors as you want and they always have a smile on their face even if you ask to try them all =D.  My favorites are their Roasted Banana, Toasted Coconut, and their Balsamic Strawberry.  Yumm....I tried their Salted Caramel that their famous for but wasn't a fan of it.  Maybe it's because I don't really like caramel in the first place =P.  I think it's more for the caramel lover. If you're brave enough (like I was) ask to try all their flavors.  That way you know how it all tastes and really decide which ones you like so afterwards you're not second guessing you're decision.   Oh even on cold nights here, there tends to be a small line...maybe a 5-10 minute wait.  But on warm nights, the line goes around the corner and expect a 15-20 minute wait.  On a super hot day...gosh I can't even imagine since it's so close to Dolores Park.

Every flavor has a different zing to it. I got the brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl, which was not out of the norm tasting, but good enough to bring me back to try more. This place is a must try. I will be back to try the roasted banana next time I am in town and maybe a sample of everything.

ICE CREAM YOU SCREAM WE ALL SCREAM FOR ICE CREAM! No really, I would scream for ice cream. I've been here 2 times now, and I would continue to go back. The first time I got Mint Chip, which is my go-to flavor and I always love it. This time I got Apricot Sorbet, which was extremely Apricot-y, it wasn't as icy as I had hoped, and was a little..sticky? I'm not sure, but it wasn't my favorite. I also don't usually choose sorbet so that might be why. This place is so popular and the people are so nice.

Probably the best ice cream I've ever had!  One thing you should know about this place is that it's very small and there is always a line but it is so worth the wait.   The main flavor to go for is the salted caramel.  It's sounds different but you will not be disappinted.  It's very smooth and just so good!  They also make any kind of sundae you want.  All I needed was the salted caramel on a cone.  It's great because they also have quart sizes too. If anything, you must try this place at least once!

Like other popular ice cream places, Bi-Rite lacked sufficient seating arrangements.  However, some of their ice cream flavors are unique and tasty. In August summer afternoon, we came around 1pm.  The trick is to come at odd hours to avoid long lines.  Picking from the menu, I ordered Ginger, Honey Lavender and Balsamic Strawberry, the most three unique flavors to try.  Ginger was not too spicy and although I could taste some slight ginger flavors I think it was too mellow.  Balsamic Strawberry was OK, not too special.  My favorite was Honey Lavender because I could taste the distinct and fragrant lavender and the scoop was not too sweet.  Overall, the ice cream texture was smooth, even and creamy, but I think Ici in Berkeley have better service and more creativity. If you don't want to get in the line, you can get a pint from the Bi-Rite Grocery across the street.  They have most of the flavors.

All I have to say is SALTED CARAMEL ICE CREAM!!! Talk about LOVE at FIRST BITE!!!! :) In my weekend in SF i went back 3 times! I also tried to beg southwest if I can hand carry my ice cream to San Diego because I bought a pint and could not finish it. Sadly I could not bring it with me, even with my idea of packing dried ice on my carry on :( wahhhh!!! I had to leave my pint with my auntie and savor my last bite before I left.... I love everything salted caramel now (they even have salted caramel hot chocolate at starbucks!!! yumm) but nothing beats Bi-Rites ice-cream!!! p.s. this ice cream is pricey but worth it!

What can I say that hasn't been said before? We got the Salted Caramel and ricanelas ice cream. Ever since I discovered caramel and salt, my world has never been the same. To find it in ice cream form? Amazing! The ricanelas taste exactly like horchata and comes with a nice surprising crunch of the snickerdoodle cookie. Great service and really patient if you want to sample all the flavors. On another note: I'm jealous of anyone that lives in this area. So many good places to eat all in walking distance!

[Calling in before we head to BiRite] J.Anne.Y:  Hi is there a line right now? BiRite Creamery:  Of course!  There's always a line hun! ...after a 15 minute wait...two scoops of lavender honey and roasted banana later it all makes sense.  This is delicious!  I may even wait 30 minutes for this again!!! Tip:  Parking is a pain.  If you find a spot even two blocks away take it!  Don't let the parking or the lines keep you away from trying the ice cream.  The line moves at a steady pace.  Words with friends + Angry Birds will make the time fly as you wait.

I had two flavors: salted caramel and coffee toffee.  I LOVED the salted caramel.  It tasted more of a burnt caramel, but OH SO YUMMY!  The coffee toffee was a nice complimentary flavor. My sis had mint chip and honey lavender, which i stole a lick of.  AAAHHH.  If aromatherapy had a flavor, this would be it....only better!  I felt so peaceful and serene after trying it, which was much needed after the parking situation wrecked my nerves.

A friend an I spent the day in the city on Saturday which we topped off with a visit to 'heaven sent' aka Bi-Rite. The Salted Caramel and Honey Lavender is the way to go! Make sure the lovely person behind the counter leaves the Honey Lavender for the second scoop. It will not only give your patience a work out whilst you enjoy the deliciousness that is their Salted Caramel but you will be rewarded with a stellar, delicate and sweet finale. I'm not joking when I say that those two scoops were... life changing. You kind of drift after first taste, deeper and deeper until you have devoured it all with your eyes closed - then you open them - taking a minute for your eyes to focus in again. Do you care if people stare??? No! The line that stretched from their door to the corner was worth it, it moves fast anyway. Take your friend by the arm with your scoops in the other and head for dolores park, sit amongst the palms and fellow locals and just be...

Bi-Rite Creamery is, as the 5 stars indicate, as good as homemade crafted  ice cream and sundaes gets in San Francisco.  But if I could give a half star I would give them 4 1/2, only because they don't make shakes and malts - maybe that will change.... Bi Rite always has great flavors to choose from.  Yes, it's expensive but suck it up and go all out and get one of their sundaes.  My recommendation would be the banana split, it's pretty big so it's great to share. But I guess if you were really ambitious you could power your way thru it all by yourself...but you will have a tummyache after! One of the things I like about this place is the ability to get two flavors in a single scoop serving. This may sound trivial but it really is great, especially if you only want one scoop but have a hard time deciding on a single flavor.

This place has amazing ice-cream. The honey/lavender one is a masterpiece, period. Especially developed to enjoy the best way in the world to eat it. They can have a line that goes around Dolores park 3 or 4 times, which is understandable.

As you come down 18th and Dolores street, once you see the line rounding around the block - you know you're close to BiRite Creamery. This small ice cream shop serves some of the most creamiest and delicious mixtures you can imagine. I love the Toffee Sundae - housemade almond toffee is crumbled with marcona almonds on top of coffee toffee ice cream with hot fudge and whipped cream. Other delcious flavors are salted caramel, roasted banana, balsamic strawberry, and toasted coconut.

MMMM, I tried the salted caramel and honey lavender. I've never had salted caramel before, so I can't really compare it to something else, but it was dericiousss. And the cone tasted fresh out of the oven too (wait...cones are baked in the oven, right?). The only down side was that my salted caramel melted really fast, and I wasn't even eating it slowly. I ordered the kids sized cone for ~$2. I had a bite of the honey lavender from my friend, and it felt like I just took a bite from Bath & Body Works. It was like swallowing the scent of lotion, lol. Lavender relaxes you, am I right? Anyways, I didn't expect something to taste like that from ice cream. Definitely worth a try.

The ice cream here is so incredible.  It is so much better than any other ice cream I have had anywhere else.  I had the roasted banana.  I love banana ice cream.  The last time I had banana ice cream was twenty-five years ago.  Most places don't even realize that banana might be a flavor as opposed to an ingredient.  The ice cream was so wonderful. The line is long and well worth the wait.  The service is quite good and there is enough indoor seating.  I'll definitely be coming back.  I may never eat ice cream anywhere else again though. Oh, and it's cheaper than most chain ice cream shops.

I crave their earl grey ice cream. ...mmmm..I actually can't believe that I haven't already reviewed this place since I actually have many holes punched out of my frequent buyer card.  In fact once I ran into a friend here and I was a bit embarrassed when he saw me walking out with several pints of ice cream.  I've had many many of their flavors, but I think that my overall favorite is the earl grey...mmmm....I try to keep a pint in my freezer if I can..but hey it disappears fast.

One sentence summary: Definitely one of those places you have to go to before you die. Recommendations: Overall, everything there looks and tastes fantastic. Look at the menu and get what looks good to you. Other than that, I suggest trying the roasted coconut, brown butter pecan, salted caramel, and coffee toffee. The Bad: Usually, theres a long line that goes around the corner. But the majority don't seem to mind since the ice cream is so good.

Bi-Rite, I think I love you.  I've fallen for that salty sweetness you call Salted Caramel!  And your Butter Pecan?  Omg, I could probably eat a whole pint in one sitting.  (Those who know me know I'm not exaggerating!)  You even have a frequent Bi-Rite-r's card, woot!  I just wish you were open later...who needs greasy late-night food when you can get ice cream? There are a couple of flavors I don't care much for: the lavender was a little too overwhelming for my (unrefined) palate - it's similar to the lavender ice cream at Anisette Brasserie in Santa Monica.  I'm also not the biggest fan of the Earl Grey either but my roommate loves it.   Mmm, salted caramel...

I think Bi-Rite is a little overrated (personally I prefer Mitchell's), but it's still some pretty good ice cream. Things that separate Bi-Rite from others: - most unique flavors: salted caramel, ginger, honey lavender, ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles), brown butter pecan, roasted banana, creme fraiche, etc. - crazy high prices - crazy long lines Be prepared to wait in line for 30-60 minutes, and ready to spend aroudn $5 for a tiny bit of ice cream. If you're cool with that, then this place is for you! No, I'm not a hater, but people should know that the lines are long and the prices are high. That being said, the ice cream is good.

Can't believe I've never reviewed this place! It is probably my favorite stop in SF, and well worth the drive from the south bay. I was originally hooked on honey lavender (try it!!) but now I'm really enjoying coffee toffee.  Every time I hit a little toffee bit, my life becomes a pinch more joyous. I've taken to buying pints to take home with me, especially when the line is long since you can avoid the line by buying a pint! Check out Bi-Rite market on the same block, too.

Came here one night with a bunch of friends, and it was close to closing. LUCKILY, we made it in time despite the line. Waited for about 5-10 minutes for a scoop of the Salted Caramel I read about. I had it with a sugar cone, and a couple of my friends had it in a cup. I think I had the tastier choice. :) It was indeed tasty, but what is most interesting about this was it's taste. I cannot fully grasp a definite description, so I'll just say it was Salted and Caramelly. I've never had this unique flavor clash inside my mouth, confusing my taste buds with such tastes. I NEED to come back to this place to try their other selections if not grab one or two scoops of their Salted Caramel again. Good luck finding parking though, it was a packed street when I went down there. But if you're feeling a bit daring, park where ever you want and grab yourself a scoop and zoom away happily eating your ice cream. (Just don't say I told you so if you get ticketed.)

DELICIOUSSS!!! :) I've driven past this place many times & always see a long line. I finally was able to come here about a year ago on Mother's Day. It was a beautiful day in May, & of course the line was already at the corner. I didn't wait too long to get to the front of the line. Their Salted Caramel was YUM! It's their most popular flavor, so of course I to had to try it. Also, they just brought back the Balsamic Strawberry. I loved it! It was soo good! I wish that they had it all the time, haha. I've stayed loyal to these flavors the following times. There's limited seating here. You're probably better off enjoying your ice cream on the benches outside or across the street at Dolores Park. Parking usually sucks around this area, so good luck! But I can't wait to come again! ;)

Definitely one of the best desserts to treat yourself to on a nice, hot and sunny day. But as long as that sun stays out, the line for Bi-Rite will be even longer. If you don't mind waiting (I suggest you do), then you'll be treated to one of SF's best treats. My favorite so far? Well I haven't tried them all to have a clear-cut favorite but I do love the Honey Lavender and Earl Grey. Ice cream at its perfection. I tried the Salted Caramel and didn't think it was all that. It's right by Dolores Park and the Mission, so it's a perfect place to drop by for a snack or even right after dinner.

Gee, I feel so honored to be the 1145th reviewer of Bi-Rite. In case you were not enticed by the other 1144 rave reviews of the Bi Rite Creamery, and still need convincing, here's one more. Yes, it's the best in the Bay Area, likely the best in California. The Mexican Chocolate is my favorite (chocolate with nuts). The Ritual Coffee Toffee is also great. Honey Lavendar and Salted Caramel are good, more subtle flavors. Make sure you top of your cup with their chocolate sauce. Oh, and the sundaes are to die for. Could I make it a meal? If it's one of the 15 or so hot days a year that bless San Francisco, be prepared to wait in a line around the corner. On any other day, you'll stll probably wait a bit, but yes, it's that good.

After reading the many positive reviews I decided to check out what the hype was all about. Results were accurate! Pros 1. Extremely Original Flavors! 2. I tried two flavors, Honey Lavendar and Coffee Toffee both were AMAZING! 3. Friendly Staff 4. Local business feel Cons 1. The scoops were smaller than what I am used to from a ice cream shop. 2. If you're driving here, get ready to spend 10 minutes looking for parking. Conclusion It's well worth the drive, and the time it takes to find parking. Order at least a double scoop to satisfy your craving!!!

Wow. 3238 reviews, I get it. The ice cream is good.   What ISN'T so tasty is finding a hair wrapped up IN my ice cream. As in, it wasn't sitting on the surface and in no way could it have been my own hair. Upon my discovery - unfortunately, I was more than halfway done - I looked up at the people working behind the counter. Every single one of them had long, unkempt hair. Ok, to be fair, one guy who was totally jamming to the music had somewhat-"done" hair, but he was bouncing around back there with no hair net or hat. One girl had long, loose pigtails coming down the front of her shoulders, with a hat loosely sitting on top. Another girl had a long side ponytail, also down the front of her shoulder, and an oversized beanie. Imagine, they all have to LEAN OVER to SCOOP the ice cream. With what looked like unwashed hair, inches away from the ice cream. It just repulsed me. I'm all for this hipster "style," but in such a fast, crowded food service place, cleanliness should come above all else. Bi-rite, please ask your employees to wear hair nets or tie their hair back, at the very least. I mean, they can be day-glo hair nets and ties.

I went here a while after we finished eating our Tartine goodies, and they were just opening.   Since it was just us, it was nice that we weren't rushed and they let us take our time choosing our ice cream, the ladies there were really lovely! Anyways, I ended up getting the Roasted Banana and the much-mentioned Lavender & Honey ice cream--I actually really loved the latter. The Basil ice cream was surprising as well, but I didn't think I could finish a whole scoop of it, so I decided to not be too adventurous. Just as a side anecdote, the girl helping us out thought we were tourists even though we were from the Bay Area.  It was our first time visiting so it must've been the look of utter confusion and the fact that my friend had a camera hanging around her neck that made it seem like we were from out of town.

If you want the best ice cream in SF, Bi-Rite is it. Only a few flavors, which is great because with a line nearly a block long, you don't want people wasting time picking from a huge menu, especially since there are no wrong choices. The texture of this ice cream is perfectly smooth and creamy. Every flavor I've tried is tasty, though the balsamic strawberry could use more balsamic. Yummier than Mitchells and cheaper than Humphry Slocombe, not to mention nicer staff.

My boyfriend and I stopped by on a sunny Sunday afternoon. The line ended just at the corner, but the wait was only 10 minutes or so. I ordered the Dainty Gent sundae, which is truly the most perfect ice cream treat I've ever had: honey lavender ice cream, blood orange olive oil (omg.), hot fudge, and Maldon sea salt (o.m.g.). They let me order it as a single scoop (typically I think they give you the "double" size), which was the perfect amount. My boyfriend had a scoop of the famed salted caramel, which he LOVED -- and he doesn't even like ice cream that much (I know). He said it brought him back to his childhood and eating burnt sugar candy. Service was great, but the real deal-maker is the shop's proximity to Dolores Park. We took our ice cream and crossed the street to picnic on the lawn. Perfect San Francisco afternoon.

Pure deliciousness. Don't be turned away by the long lines, they move fast and the ice cream is worth any kind of wait anyways. The Salted Caramel ice cream makes it on the 7x7 Things to Try Before You Die list every year. You can't go wrong with this flavor. Also deserving of a mention: Toasted Coconut & Roasted Banana. If you don't want to wait in line, you can grab a few pints and bring it directly to the register.

Your dilemma: "Man, I really want icecream. Where should I go?" My answer? "Simple. Bi-Rite mofo'in Cremery, my friend." Not only do they make icecream fresh everyday, use local organic ingredients, biodegradable packing materials, it's a party in my mouth. I was sold after my first scoop. Sure, they have some basic flavors for the non-adventurous types. Vanilla, chocolate, cookies and cream? Check, check, and check. But why have those when they have flavors like Salted Caramel, Honey Lavender, and Snickerdoodle?! I really had to resist the urge to type "Snickerdoodle" in all capital letters, I'm just that enthusiastic about the flavor. It's delicious, with little chunks of crunchy goodness in a sweet cinnamon-y bed of creamy dairy perfection. I warn you, lines are long and the wait may seem like forever, but it's totally worth it when you dig into that refreshing scoop. Note: If you're buying a pint, there's a separate line for that, so you pass by everyone waiting for individual scoops.

Got my fix of salted caramel and balsamic strawberry! The single scoop size is perfect for slipping past my newly developed lactose intolerance. (sigh, it's on the internet now, that means it's really real.) How do i describe this ice cream... smooth - no ice chunks here!, creamy, melts fast but wouldn't last anyway. You know how some flavors don't translate well to other mediums? This ice cream tastes like the real thing... rich silky caramel, full flavored subtle strawberry... but in a fresh cone. Oddly there was no line here at 7pm on a friday - just a bunch of new moms and dads looking for an escape. maybe it picks up around closing time? parking IS ridiculous though. you might as well try to land a helicopter on this block. i'm going to lobby for a bus directly here from bart.

I've tasted salted caramel before (in Seattle) but I thought, what's so great about it? I did not know what I was missing until I tried Bi-Rite. One taste of your salted caramel and I was in LOVE. Their ice cream is soft, and super deliciously perfect. I was re-directed to the window outside because I wanted the salted caramel soft serve..... and got the swirl of the day salted caramel with vanilla. It was heaven sent! Soft, creamy, and reminded me of this caramelized sugar dessert in the streets of Korea..... so delicious. I noticed they had cupcakes and other baked goods as well but I had to resist! I had plans to try another cupcake place elsewhere. I wish there was one in the southbay..... because I'd go everyday. :) COME HERE FOR THE BEST ICE CREAM IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD!!!!!!

YUM-O! It's good to know that this ice cream is NOT pumped with artificial high-fructose partially hydrogenated preservative junk so it can sit in a freezer until 2034. Anyone can appreciate anything made in-house with organic and sustainable local ingredients which is even presented to you in recyclable materials! Or ice cream can come on an edible cone or cookie ice cream sandwich. 18 years in Berkeley makes me indeed part hippie, but this place really has a great idea going on! Creative flavors and super creamy consistency. The salted caramel was divine! Buttery, salee/sucre, cold flavor combination. I want more!!! There was no line when I went about 30 minutes before closing. Actually, it was quite empty but I might just wait in line for this. They also have a stamp card!

I'm going to dedicate Jodeci's "Feenin'" to the roasted banana. "I can't leave you alone, you got me feenin". This place has 3000+ reviews, what is there to say that hasn't been addressed? Well, I think there is a lack of roasted banana fanfare. I don't think you guys understand how good this flavor is. Everytime I take a bite, I can imagine the ice cream wizard (Bi-Rite employee) hovering over a skillet with some type of Bananas Foster concoction, simmering all the lovely, brown sugar, caramelly goodness to perfection. One time I went to Bi-Rite and I thought I was going to try a different flavor but as I was approaching the counter, the Afternoon Snack Sundae caught my eye and why wouldn't it? It consists of roasted banana, caramel, and homemade graham crackers. So naturally, I pulled an audible and ditched the idea of expanding my flavor horizon. I must say, that was one of the best decisions I've ever made in 2010. The Afternoon Snack Sundae is the biz (and I never use that expression). Roasted Banana reigns supreme. I don't ever think I'll be able to taste anything else that Bi-Rite has to offer.

Stopped in with Classy Mike - and special guest Mr. Matt-boto - for dessert during our road trip from New York to Los Angeles. We finished dinner at about 10:30, meaning we had half an hour to get to Bi-Rite.  Thinking on the spot, I suggested we flag down a cab. Twenty-five minutes later, and not a moment too soon, the driver dropped us off in front of the line of 15-20 people. "Is this a bar?"  He asked, reasonably. "Nope."  We said.  "Ice cream." He laughed.   But you gotta be dedicated. Bi-Rite is the kind of place where you eat way more than you should, go to sleep stupidly full, then walk up in the morning and pace around nervously before making the inevitable decision to go back and start the cycle anew. It likes up to the hype.  Amazing flavors, homemade graham crackers (!), hot fudge, brownies, and the line doesn't even take that long.  I've eaten ice cream all around the country, and this one is on the very small list of my two or three favorites. Food: 25/25 stars Ambiance: 18/25 stars Service: 25/25 stars Bathroom: 19/25 stars Probability of going back: 100%

Roasted banana ice cream - super creamy, not overly sweet, slightly nutty, and with the essence of banana.  Try combining it with salted caramel or chocolate (you can get two flavors in a single). The best part is that they don't tell you the nutritional information, so you can enjoy it without worrying about the fat/calories, yet you know the ingredients are fresh/natural.   It's worth waiting in line for.  It also means I never order dessert at any restaurant when I'm anywhere near Bi-Rite.

I don't think I've ever reviewed a place with over 2,000 reviews on Yelp before. We didn't plan on Bi-Rite. We said that if the creamery was still open after a late dinner at Delfina, we'd try it. Imagine my glee when we arrived 5 minutes AFTER closing time and they were still open. They people there were friendly. And cool. And hot. I got a giant-sized kid's scoop of the salted caramel. It was made of dreams. 2,000+ reviews. What else is there to say? Just go.

My 1st ever yelp review and I definitely wouldn't have guessed it to be about ice cream.  So here goes: My friend wanted ice cream yesterday and suggested that we go back to Mitchell's.  Wanting to try somewhere different, I proposed Bi-Rite and WOW we weren't disappointed.  Some of their unique flavors included salted caramel, balsamic strawberry, and honey lavendar, which they allowed us to try without compliant. Normally, I only like to get a scoop of ice cream, but since I was being adventurous I picked their Peachy Sundae.  Another WOW!! 2 scoops of ginger ice cream, peach compote, sugar crisps and a dallop of whipped cream. The flavors melded  like PB&J!

If you live in the city, then you know bi-rite. Everyone talks of it. Every time you pass it there are long lines. They also sell it in some stores. Bi-rite is something that people seem to consider authentically San Franciscan. With that said, I expected to reach nirvana when eating this ice cream. Expectations were sky high. I would have to say that it didn't meet those expectations. Then again, I'm not sure any ice cream could've. Their unique flavors reminds me of Bombay Creamery and I particularly enjoyed that. I got two flavors that I judge most places by: chocolate and coffee. Their version of chocolate had a hint of cinnamon and their version of coffee came with toffee bits. They were both absolutely delicious. On a somewhat unrelated note, I did a mental comparison of this to frozen yogurt (a popular current trend). While the ice cream was good, it was something that, after 2 scoops (single serving), I was quite done. My sugar buds were done with. But with frozen yogurt, flavors tends to be more subtle. There less of a blast to your taste buds which I appreciate. I'll definitely have to return to try the other flavors but, for now, I don't consider it worth waiting in a really long line. It seems that people have a partiality for it because it is an independent, local business with a certain flair. But, in my eyes, they have real competition when it comes to Bombay Creamery and Mitchell's.

ADORE! When I first moved to SF... all I heard was how great this place was.  I was skeptical and refused to believe the hype until I tried it.  I tried it, and immediately fell in love.   My favorite has to be the brown sugar with ginger caramel swirls.  My mouth literally just watered!  Anyways, I haven't ever encountered a flavor that I didn't like here.  So the problem comes down to which flavor to get since they are all so good. Stop reading and just go there now!

Indulge your taste buds to something new, something different, something not in those commercial grocery stores!  Bi-Rite Ice cream is thee spot if you want to get out of your comfort zone.  Now this place is not hyped up and all talk like ...well, I won't go there but you get my point.  You don't?  Trust me; Bi-Rite has flavors to blow your mind!  Roasted Banana, Salty Caramel, Orange Pomegranate Sorbet, Brown Butter Pecan, Coffee Toffee etc. Being that I was an ice cream virgin to this place, I wanted to get something that will sure give my ice cravings a kick in the ass!  So what the heck, I asked for a scoop of Salty Caramel and a scoop of Coffee Toffee.  Talk about a combo!  A combo that is just as good as Pacquiao's combo punches against his boxing foes.   The perfect amount of saltiness with the smooth, silk taste of caramel, you definitely can't just have ONE bite.  Talk about a taste bud boost!  The Coffee Toffee has to be thee best coffee ice cream I ever tasted!  You definitely get that rich coffee taste and you can also see it as well.  I'm talking about the lil coffee grinds that you can see every time you take a bite.  The amount of toffee is just right, it adds another depth of flavor and sweetness to it.   If you haven't been to Bi-Rite before, get there.  You'll thank me later..

Bi-Rite is a fun place to BE: for the young, old, ice-cream lovers, and ice-cream newbies.  I got the single-size cup and let myself indulge in two flavors: Salted Caramel (a crowd favorite) and Toasted Coconut.  I'm not a fan of caramel or coconut but these flavors weren't super strong or sweet.  The workers move pretty quick and you get to sample!  So try the Basil Strawberry, the Peach Ginger, Olive Oil flavor (yum), and anything to your heart's desire!  (Just keep in mind that there are other people waiting, practically any time of day.)  Everything made from scratch--even the olive oil. I love that there's seating space inside for those windy, colder days, even seating right outside the creamery.  Dolores Park is also across the intersection, so you get a good view of the city (perfect for love birds, friends, and families).  The whole local, family-owned feel in a big city makes everything feel right. I would definitely come here again for a good portioned fix for ice cream.  Next time on a warm sunny day, where no fog is to be seen.  Indulge a little!

Oh, Bi-Rite, I went all out of my way to see you and taste your delicious salted caramel ice cream, and was sadly disappointed. I might have given it a higher rating (like a 3) but my expectations were so high and then miserably dashed.  This is supposed to be the gold standard for all salted caramel ice cream, and while the flavor was fine, the ice cream had ice chunks and was not creamy.  So sad.

Perhaps the best ice cream I've ever tasted.  It is home-made and soooo good.  I had chocolate ice cream with caramel sauce. When we were there, Owen Wilson and Kate Hudson were there, too.  Kate had soy chocolate.  We're not sure what Owen had. You know it's good if Kate Hudson is getting some.

Typical Sunday: 1. Go to Dolores park 2. Get really hot 3. Wait in line for 20-40 minutes @ BiRite, sweating and drooling at the mounds of glorious, fast-melting ice cream being carried out by the people in front of you 4. Order your REALLY UNIQUE and GOURMET and delicious flavor(s) 5. Fork out more money than you should for ice cream 6. Eat your ice-cream super fast because BiRite ice cream seems to have a mysteriously low melting point 7. Spend the rest of the afternoon daydreaming about BiRite ice cream in Dolores Park

Came here early November before it got too cold to enjoy an ice cream cup on the tiny benches around the trees outside. Got the ice cream in three flavors: Pumpkin, Snickerdoodle, and Butter Pecan. Really liked the combination... Until we found a little piece of hair in the Snickerdoodle half-way. Friend didn't care though and savored the rest even faster than the first half. I gotta admit, it was quite delish still.

Holy begeezus! Another dope ice cream spot to hit up. This place may give my ol' reliable Swenson's a run for its money. This small little ice cream shop definitely packs a punch with a range of organic ice cream flavors. Salt caramel, basic chocolate and the cookies and cream were great. It's a bit hipster-ish but I think its got the goods to hold its own. Drawbacks? Popular and trendy. We barely missed the line that formed instantly once we walked through the door. Be prepared to wait around.

Two stories One: I walk in right about 11 on a Friday morning....guy at the counter asks me what I'm up to....I say "getting my ice cream fix...then I'm off to Philz for a coffee...then up to Burma Superstar for lunch and Friday night at the deYoung..."...guy at counter says "You are my dream girl...I wish I could get someone to cover for me and I would totally come along..."...this was the beginning of a great day Two: I ordered the Salted Caramel and Honey Lavender side by side and as I tried to walk down the street I was incapacitated by the goodness of this ice cream.  It literally stops you in your tracks....unbelievable! I am thinking of moving to the Mission solely to be next to this amazing shop!

I'm too much of an ice cream purist to truly appreciate some of the creative flavor combinations a place like Bi-Rite comes up with.  I mean, unless a place has some profound version of espresso chip, or something involving either vanilla, chocolate, or coffee with actual chocolate chunks in it... it's lost on me.  I'm just too in love with the above flavors. I do have to say though, Bi-Rite was incredible.  I've become a HUGE HUGE HUGE fan of the salted caramel flavor...and I'm a guy who doesn't really like caramel!   The staff were nice, though not overly so... and they seemed patient with requesting samples.   My verdict...this is a great place to go with a small group of friends...everyone orders something different and round and round we go.

We were supposed to get dinner in the city last night, followed by dessert at Bi-Rite.  However, stuff happened and we got delayed such that if we went to dinner, we probably wouldn't make it to BiRite before closing. So. We went to BiRite for dinner. Easiest decision ever. BTW:  The honey lavender just doesn't get enough yelp love! Definitely an underrated flavor peoples!

Arguably my favorite ice cream shop in the city. The service is really quite good, and the ice cream made here is second to none. I really like the honey lavender (oddly, as that did not sound attractive to me at first). Try the olive oil and sea salt over chocolate ice cream - definitely an unusual yet good combination.

Finally got to try this place on a nice sunny Sunday :) Perfect for ice cream, but that meant a lot of people were thinking the same thing.. o_o DON'T LEAVE BECAUSE THE LINE LOOKS TOO LONG. Once you take the first bite you will think to yourself , "this...was... SO WORTH IT!!!". TRUST MEEE! The wait really wasn't that long. It wrapped around the corner and went a bit down the street. But I think we waited about 20 minutes. When you have company 20minutes goes by very fast. I've been getting into Salted Caramel flavored things so it was awesome that their "flavor to try" was the Salted Caramel flavored ice cream!! I also ordered the Roasted Banana flavor. Both flavors were excellent! Craving some right now... *drool. I love banana flavored ice cream, or banana flavored anything in fact. The Salted Caramel they said was going to be a lot softer because of the high percentage of sugar, and it sure was soft and creamy and just awesome :) This is a great location. You can enjoy it after or before visiting/chilling in Dolores Park which is just across the street.

Bi-Rite Creamery is good. Damn good. Damn, damn good. That is my review. I would now like to suggest how you use the ice cream experience in the sequence of a day. So, this is what you do: Muddy Waters on Valencia, Clarion Alley, Thrift Town, Dolores Park, Bi-Rite Creamery; in that order. You just set up a day of magic in the Mission. For added magic, tag something on the way, slap a sticker on a couple of posts, and cruise on your cruiser down the Mission on a sunny day. Damn, The Mission is cherry. Life is awesome in The Mission.

AMAZING.  I LOVE this place. Had the Salted Caramel and Balsamic Strawberry Ice Cream, both are just so perfect any time of the day. I will rave about this for a long time to come. Everything about the flavors here is spot on: Not too rich, not too salty or sweet, and not the slightest hint of anything artificial. Every ingredient is carefully chosen, organically produced, locally farmed, and it makes all the difference in the texture and taste of the ice cream. They choose their ingredients wisely at Bi-Rite and don't skimp with lesser quality fillers. I have been waiting a long time to try this place and it is EXACTLY what I was hoping for and more. I can't wait to come back for more, and next time- I'm definitely taking home a pint. Or two!

Three stars will suffice for this place.  Let's see if I can explain this briefly. Extremely long line on a Monday night at 9:15. (-) Amazingly delicious cinnamon and snickerdoodle flavor. (+++) Ice crystals in the chocolate coconut. (-) Organic ice cream. (++) Fairly priced scoops compared to other ice creameries. (-/+) So, I'm going to say 3 stars will suffice.  It's good, but not so amazingly good I would go out of my way for it.

The first time I went here I ordered the Sam's Sundae after seeing it on best thing. I just didn't get it, olive oil on ice cream was just a little much for me. I did go back again and just got a normal scoop of ice cream. You really can't go wrong with ice cream, let's face it, it's always good. At Bi-Rite creamery they do a great job of offering a variety of creamy flavors.

All I can say is... D-LISH!!! Our friends brought us here tonight after dinner - first time I've been in a totally cool ice cream shop - wow! Cool tunes in the store, cool employees and great location! And now for the good part ... the ice cream was out of this world. Apparently it's all organic and made fresh on the premises, awesome! They also have soy ice cream for those who are lactose intolerant. We all had cones - those of us who had ice cream had the "salted caramel," "chocolate," and "mint chip" flavors. Who would've thought that a good flavor of ice cream could have "salted" in the title? But hey - it was really really good! Totally recommend (especially after a nice long day basking in the sun and warmth of Dolores Park)!

Amazing!  Where else can you find flavors like roasted banana and salted caramel (with rich specks of black sea salt studded throughout)?  If the Indian ice cream place is a bit too much for your American tastes, then Bi-Rite will surely lead you down the path of righteousness (or culinary adventurousness...) So the line is long and the ice cream melts quickly, but what do you expect of a place that is this good?  They also make sundaes to order, sell their ice cream by the pint and will double punch your cone card if you smile & tip.  A perfect afternoon indulgence.  I can't wait to try the honey lavender.  Yum.

Was referred to this place by a friend in order to get me to stop whining about Sketch closing. Was told Bi-Rite was similar enough to Sketch for me to get my fix. Was delighted with the brownie sundae we ordered. Was WAY too full after scarfing said brownie sundae while sitting in sunny Dolores Park across the street. Was pleasantly surprised that the brown butter pecan ice cream actually had little flecks of butter in it. Was convinced I gained 5 pounds immediately after finishing all the ice cream we bought. Until next time.

If you live in SF and haven't heard of Bi-Rite, you've probably been living in a cave, as it's developed a cult following! Pros: "Unique" Ice Cream Flavors Cons: Ice Cream Flavors aren't unique enough! The standout flavors of the night were Brown Sugar and Honey Lavender. Runner-ups would be Salted Caramel and Pumpkin. Unfortunately, they didn't have Balsamic Strawberry or Earl Grey this time, so I didn't get to try those. My main gripe with Bi-Rite is that there aren't enough flavors that are "out there." The majority of the flavors were rather bland and uninteresting (ie: chocolate, vanilla, etc.). I'd like to see more creativity in their selection...just take a look at Humphrey Slocombe in SF or Scoops in LA. With that being said, Bi-Rite is still one of those quintessential checklist experiences that every San Franciscan should try at least once. Check! ...now, what's next?

I am an ice cream fiend, so visiting Bi-Rite was something to check off my bucket list. I ordered a scoop of salted caramel and one of coffee toffee. They taste exactly as described and are of very good quality. Don't go expecting Baskin Robbins or Cold Stones scoops. The biggest bang for your buck would be one of the cartons, which is also a ticket to cut the line. If you go this route, they also have an incredibly large selection of jarred toppings - salted caramel, chocolate sauce every which way, etc.

Unique ice cream flavors make it worth the trip and the wait. There's usually a line to get ice cream in the evening or during a hot day, but it's worth the wait. Their flavors are yummy, and if you're not sure what one tastes like, they're always happy to give you tastings at the counter. My personal favorites include ricanelas, roasted coconut (some batches aren't as good as others of this flavor) and lavendar (though my friend says it tastes like soap. I personally love it.) Get a scoop then get a pint for home! Don't want to wait in line? Just grab the pint and go to the head of the line. They also have a soft serve option at another window, which has less of a line.

Yummy, yummy. Get in my belly! I love that they are trying out different flavors. Favorites are the Roasted Banana and Lemon. Salted Caramel, which is highly touted, was tasty but I was tasting too much salt. Maybe its just my sensitivity to it. I wasn't such a fan of the Chai Milk Chocolate. The best I had was Springtime Sundae with the Roasted Banana; came with crumbled sugar cookies and fresh strawberry compote. Mmm. Mm! Two downers: one, a bum that smelled like pee that was sifting thru the trash while we were in line. He dropped some creamy trash on my sandled foot. :"( And I think the ladies were a little stressed behind the counter. Non-stop park-goers and parents with their kids. They need three people working and some more counter space. In the future, if the line is long, I'm going to walk across the street to Bi-Rite market and look for some pre-packaged in the freezer section.

After 867 reviews, I'm just singing in the choir. Bi-Rite is awesome!  When I first moved to the Bay Area, I thought Fenton's was pretty damn good.  Nuh-uh.  Bi-Rite rocks!  Okay, the salted caramel was overrated, but I love their rocky road with almonds.  Who doesn't love marshmallow in their ice cream? Bad part of Bi-Rite?  Location sucks.  Don't get me wrong, I love the Mission.  In fact, I'd probably live there if it weren't for work.  But parking can be tortuous.  Fortunately, I've been blessed with good parking karma.  So far, on my trips...scratch that...treks up there I've parked within 2 blocks of Bi-Rite.  Ah yeah!  So, if anyone wants a Bi-Rite run and has poor parking karma, let me know so I can change all that.

Oh.My.Gosh!  On a beautiful Sunday afternoon I was CRAVING for some Bi-Rite Honey Lavender Ice cream and my stubborn Taurean self kicked in while looking for parking.  I literally drove an hour looking for parking and after being frustrated decided that I could park in the BUS ZONE  across the street from Bi-Rite and just stop in for 5 minutes.   Don't try this at home fellow SF folks!  I parked in that bus zone for literally 5 minutes and when I popped out with my yummy honey lavender ice cream cone in hand, I had a $250 PARKING TICKET waiting for me on my windshield.  Honey lavender ice cream from Bi-Rite may be  the only reason that is worth getting a parking ticket that high but still $250 for a bus zone?   Does someone know an SF cop who can write this off for me?!  I kid.  I kid. I'm actually going to contest this and use the folks at Bi-Rite as my witness.  If that doesn't work, I'm going to bribe the judge with some YUMMY bi-rite honey lavender or salted caramel ice cream. So note to all you fellow yelpers ~ don't park in the bus zone across the street while going to bi-rite for ice cream.  Those SF meter maids/cops don't show mercy.

How long have I heard of this place? Forever. How many times had I been before last week? Never. But then twice in one week! I love SF heat waves! So the first time I went, I tried Sam's Sundae - chocolate ice cream, bergamot olive oil, sea salt and whipped cream. I like to try odd stuff like that from time to time because if I don't, I go home wondering about it. And then kind of obsess over it. And I wasn't sure when I was going to make it back to this place. Anyway, long story short, it was interesting and good. In that order. The olive oil was really light and had a pretty strong floral essence to it, and I liked the sea salt in it a lot, but there looked to be so much more to try. So...the second time I went, I tried the cookies and cream and the salted caramel. WOW. That salted caramel is a piece of work. When you first taste it, it tastes like it's going to be super-sweet, but then all of the sudden the salty bit kicks in and it's a perfect balance. Oh, and the cookies and cream? Whatever those cookies are...they could kick Oreo's ass in a heartbeat.

My boyfriend and I tried the Salted Caramel mixed with Chocolate and the Toffee Coffee. I've never had so much Toffee in my ice cream, it was heaven! And the Chocolate?!

SALTED CARAMEL ICE CREAM!   I went four times in one week..need I say more?   I love the salted caramel ice and coffee toffee.  I hate it when places go stingy on the toffee, but every bite I took into the coffee ice cream,  I got a piece of toffee.  Equal portions makes me happy.   The coffee toffee ice cream cake is delicious as well.  I had that for my birthday cake!   YUMMY! I also love the fact that you can get a card (10 punches, and you get 1 for free).  I think I've already gone through two cards.

To the clueless boys out there: the way to a girl's heart?  One (or a few) pint of ice cream from Bi-Rite!!   Some recs: salted caramel- it was love at first bite. nuff said. honey lavender- subtle floral flavor and not too sweet.  it's different from your everyday flavors. a definite must try. roasted banana- i'm not a huge fan of bananas, but this is delicious and not at all overwhelming. yum!

I guess something must be wrong with me because I really don't know what the fuss is about this place. I even tried it a few other times just to see if I had some damage in my mouth. Maybe next time I need to have a few drinks in me before I go? I think it could be because I'm more of a Yogurt fan than an ice cream fan. The ice cream is good but I don't think i'ts worth it to wait in line some days for an hour. I tried the sundae that one lady from food channel has and I did not like it though it is creative.

Standing in line for ice cream in 50 degree weather at 10pm takes dedication.  I always thought people were crazy to stand in line on a chilly night for ice cream, but at Bi-Rite Creamery, I understand why.  Rain or shine, there is always a line at Bi-Rite.  When I didn't think it could get any better, their new remodel includes a bakery next door!  Yes!  A BAKERY!!!!   What's even better about Bi-Rite is that they have the most friendly staff and are super patient about giving patrons tastes of the different flavors.  The last time, however, I was being helped by this nice guy who just came back from a smoke break and I felt like could taste the remnants of his cigarrette with my Ricanelas sample as if he scooped it with his own hands.  This, however, did not prevent me from getting two scoops and a pint of Burnt Caramel to go!   Side note: So...is it bad that I put spoon to pint and almost finished it by myself in one sitting? My absolute  favorites have to be Burnt Caramel (of course...) and Roasted Banana.  Scoop them in together and you get this oh-so-cream(er)y compostable (Yes, they're GREEN!!!) spoonful of goodness!   Buy a pack of chocolate cookes (or oatmeal) and eat them with your ice cream and...Enter: Nirvana.

There's a line that runs outside the door that goes close to the end of the street, this place has to be good right! In lieu of all the recent shenanigans in Arizona and my boycotting of Cold Stone's nearby my house, I will gladly come by and support the local Ice Cream vendors even more! The cookies are delicious, but of course the main reason we come out here is to get the Ice Cream!  Whether or not you make the trek to get a scoop of what my boy Ruggy said is heaven, or just chillin with the rest of the hipsters at Dolores Park, this place is always a good idea! Just be ready to stand in line, but I promise you, it is well worth the wait!

A warm and lazy Sunday at Dolores park with a scoop of ice cream from Bi-Rite Creamery completes the equation.  Although it just so happens everyone's caught on to this discovery and the line is around the corner.  Fortunately, our wait was a mere 30 minutes.   Upon entry, you'll notice all kinds of ice cream that they offer, I'm pretty sure I asked to sample them all.  I couldn't really settle on a decision so I just stuck with the famous salted caramel.  I enjoy the flavor and consistency of caramel, I think that's what attracted me to the famous salted caramel.  The flavor of the salted caramel was... wow, STRONG, I like.  If you're nearby make a quick, stop... provided the line isn't wrapping around the block.

Yes the salted caramel is good.

I love ice cream. Polly Ann's is delicious for their off-asian flavors and the mystery of their wheel, but Bi-Rite was delicious for their creamy deliciousness. Lately, it's been all about the yogurt fad and it's tarty favors.  But it's just that; a trendy fad for now.  Ice cream is forever, and Bi-Rite is about as delicious as you can get!  I had the Toffee Coffee since it was my favorite and the White Chocolate Blackberry.  I am a fan of coffee, and the Toffee Coffee did NOT disappoint!  Wish I had gotten the Toffee Coffee sundae, but next time.  White Chocolate Blackberry left more to be desired, but I did have high hopes... Until next time Bi-Rite, my tummy misses you :)

Okay, I am a total cliche. I saw this place featured on the Food Network's "Best Thing I ever Ate" and of course I got sucked in. It had been a year in the making - my faithful pilgrimage to Bi-Rite Creamery. And...the salted caramel was simply scrumptious. I know this sounds lame - but it literally tasted like salted caramel. Fabulous! The Sam's Sundae I was salivating to try...well, it was alright. I completely appreciate the quality of the ingredients, but the combo of chocolate ice cream, salt, olive oil and whipped cream just didn't win me over. That is not to say others don't love it, because they really do - but my palate although appreciative, has no interest in having it again. I think the salt was over kill for me. The whipped cream was a delight however, very fresh indeed. I will be all over the salted caramel again and  I hope the roasted banana will be available next time too. I also want to try the honey lavender since I love the one at Ici (Oakland) so much. I tried my boyfriend's mint chocolate chip and that was delicious as well. Truly a top quality creamery with a very nice staff. When we went, we were lucky, the line was minimal, but it is funny to see a roped line all the way down the block. It's like you're waiting to get into a nightclub.  WOW, clearly they must be really busy. Parking is a nightmare, so be warned. Overall take on the place - enjoyable. I mean who doesn't love amazing high-quality sweet fatty goodness? I of course loved the ginormous pink ice cream cone structure above the entrance too.

I'm sure you have all heard, but the salted caramel is great! I also tried the earl grey and I love it! When I came, there was parking right out front and no lines at all (random weekday around 3 pm ish). After my sister and I ordered, we sat outside on their benches to eat our ice cream. Sadly, my sister's top scoop of ice cream SLIPPED off and landed on the concrete. It was truly a sad sight to see hahaha. But she went back inside and they gladly re-scooped some ice cream for her. Cool!

Quick Tip (7/19/2011): Coffee sundae! Located on the corner of Dolores and 18th St in San Francisco, this is a pretty dope place to buy some ice cream. You can buy your sundae or cone, and head on over to Dolores park (which is literally across the street) to enjoy your ice cream treat. Well, that is if the fog hasn't arrived to this part of the city yet. I always get the Coffee sundae because...I like the toffee and almonds (i think it's almonds) they put in it. It's very different from other sundaes I've had, especially Ghirardelli! It's a good change from the usual. The sundaes are much smaller, too, but is a good portion size. I think they make their own ice cream because not all the flavors stay the same, and they also sell pre-packaged ice cream. This place is pretty small, so once again...you may not want to go to this place with a ton of people unless you do plan on spending it across the street at Dolores Park. Parking can be a pain in your buttocks, but if you find one...bless you. AND the line can get pretty long, too. Just don't go there starving and expecting a huge sundae.

This is a nice ice cream shop that packs an amazingly power punch of flavor and texture to their ice cream. I came here already doing my research of the place. So i had to get the fan favorite salted caramel and a lavender flavor ice cream. I get my two scoops of ice cream and rush to scoop each flavor at a time in my mouth! WHAM-BAM! KAZAAAAM! introducing my new favorite ICE CREAM place of all time! BI- RITE! hahah! yes it was that good. Is was that good i waited in line in the rain just to get their ice cream... sounds a lil extreme but i was trying to impress someone and they too were impressed how good this ice cream was! score  ... haha!

Man this place will be packed come summer time. Being right by the park and all, while have good ice cream...dare I say, Radtastical? The salted Carmel was insane. Sounds not so good to the taste, but trust, it was on.   My first trip  was on a night where it was raining  hard, crazy hard! And the joint was still packed.

Wow, honey lavender is now my new favorite flavor. This stuff is amazing. I want to buy an ice cream maker attachment for my new KitchenAid and make honey lavender ice cream and eat it until the ice cream maker breaks. Too bad you can't smell ice cream, that would be the ultimate topper. I was sniffing my lavender hand cream while alternating spoonfuls of ice cream for the ultimate lavender experience. Next time I should get some lavender bath products, light lavender candles, and eat lavender honey ice cream while take a bath in the middle of some lavender fields. And have you smelled the aroma of  freshly ground lavender? I grounded some up to use in lavender honey french macarons and it smells so amazing! I am officially obsessed.

The salted caramel ice cream is DIVINE. It really, really, really is. I would also recommend the mint chip, but then again it's my favorite flavor, so I suggest it regardless of where I am. Do not be afraid to just ask for a sample, despite the frenetic pace at which the line moves. N.B. Although a solid five, this place really isn't worth the line around the block on the weekends. I'd recommend buying a pint to go ($8) across the street at Bi-Rite Market, or going during off-peak hours, such as 3 pm on a weekday. Hey,  no one actually works in SF, do they? ----------- P.S. Just made trip #2 to this place, simply because I walked by and there was no line. Sure, it was Sunday at  breakfast, but not only did I not give a toss about the time, I was able to leisurely sample at least 8 flavors before deciding (mint chip, as you might have expected.) What I learned is that the honey-lavender ice cream is incredible, orange cardamom sublime; malted vanilla with peanut butter and milk chocolate was divine and not too rich; and the buttered pecan was amazingly nutty and toasty.  Don't even get me started on the rocky road, or any of the other chocolate flavors. And FYI, a "single" permits the customer to choose two flavors.

Oh Salted Caramel, how do I love thee... let me count the ways I love thee to the depth and breadth and height My tongue can reach, when feeling hunger in my tummy For the ends of milk and ideal Ice Cream. I love thee to the level of everyday indulgence From my most quiet need, to exuberant joy Ok, so it is pure grabbing of another persons poem and bastardizing it... but it just fits so well.. Beyond Salted Caramel though, I have not tried anything there that I would turn down a scoop (or two of), in particular the Roasted Banana, Balsamic Strawberry, Mexican Chocolate (with peanuts), and I always thinking about (but never get) the honey lavender.

So I was intrigued by the salted caramel and dragged a friend to Bi-Rite on a weekday night! It was meant  to be- I got a beautiful parking space almost right in front! I ordered the salted caramel and the roasted banana and I sampled the balsamic strawberry AND the cookies and cream! :O All of them were A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! It's the perfect place to try something new while still sticking to your usual. That chocolate souffle is calling my name and with my new little "buy 10 get one free ice cream punch card" I'll be sure to be back! ;)

During my days of school hopping, Tuesdays meant working at Mission H.S., which in turn, meant an indulgent scoop of orgasm in your mouth ice cream at Bi-Rite.  They offer flavors, such as Salted Caramel, for the days I'm craving something both sweet and salty.  Genius!  However, my personal favorite is Coffee Toffee.  Perfect coffee ice cream with little toffee chips buried in every bite.  YUM!!!  The kid's cup with a cone on top is just enough, but you can pack in two different flavors if you upgrade to the small. Depending on the day (sometimes a random Wednesday evening), there can be a line of people out the door, almost to the corner, but it's well worth the wait.  You might think, it's only THAT good because you had to wait in a long line to get it.  Wrong!  You might also think, it's a cold, windy San Francisco night...there won't be a line.  Wrong!  Their ice cream is just THAT good.

Although I feel like I'll get stoned to death by all the Bi-Rite fans because of my 3-star review, I just gotta say one thing - what's up with charging $3.25 for a single scoop of ice-cream? Maybe it's the incredibly high expectations, my desire for salt to simply bring out the flavor in sugar but not to over-power it, or memories of reasonably priced ice cream... I just wouldn't bother if it weren't for my friends salivating upon just hearing the word "bit-rite."   That being said, I do appreciate the focus on local, natural ingredients.  Perhaps granting me an ice-cream stimulus package would get me to go on my own. :)

Everyone raves about the salted caramel flavor---and I add to the commotion!  It's literally the only ice cream flavor that makes me moan in happiness while eating it.  Literally.  The other flavors are also amazing: cookies and cream, mint, balsamic strawberry, and OH WAIT SALTED CARAMEL.   I will make a point to take all my friends here for a scoop of Salted caramel.  It's literally the best place for ice cream in SF!

I can't believe that I am just finding about this AMAZING creamery.  I ordered a double scoop: salted caramel & butter pecan.  Super Yummy! Also, I love the fact that their scoop is moderate in size, sometimes you can have too much of a good thing.  It's perfect....orgasmic pleasure without the guilty pains.   Also, the price is also really low and affordable for such a high quality product.  I can't wait to try the sundae w/ olive oil!

Sadly, I'm not so positive (as most) on Bi-Rite creamery - for two reasons: (1) There is ALWAYS a line-up. I would get off my work shuttle across the street from here every single day and the line up would be around the block. When I want ice cream, I'm not waiting 20 minutes (sadly!) irrespective of how good it is. They either need to scoop faster or get more people working there! (2) The ice cream really isn't THAT great. I've had the chocolate, salted caramel and toasted banana and while they are creamy and definitely unique, they were not that awesome, and definitely not worth the wait. I almost feel bad about this review because everyone else is so positive on this place. If you really want their ice cream, forget the line-up and head to Bi-Rite market and get a tub of it to take home.

Dear Bi-Rite, I'm so glad we met. I think about you often and I love our monthly get togethers. I tell all my friends about you and how awesome you are. Although unlike every other person on the planet, I am not too crazy about the salted caramel, although that's really just a personal preference. ;) It saddens me when you don't have some of my seasonal or discontinued favorites, notably the white chocolate blackberry swirl. I may have died and gone to heaven when I tried it. I won't hold it against you that you don't have it anymore, since you've subsituted it with new tasty flavors. ;) I do consistently love the ricanelas and a new favorite is brown butter pecan. Your servers are friendly and they get a tip when I'm buzzed after some drinks with dinner. They get an extra tip when they let me try 10 flavors before I make up my mind. Until we meet again... Fondly yours, Me

I should have guessed that Bi-Rite's soft ice cream would be a fantasy of richness, but it was just yesterday that I finally tried it. Most people seem to ignore this tiny window into heaven, as the main ice cream shop gets all of the attention (and the long line).  Step over to the second window next time and indulge in the wonderland that is soft serve.  My salted caramel and chocolate swirl cone could not have been any more delicious. Upon being presented with a multi-leveled cone I said to my companion, There's no way I'm eating this whole thing.  It's huge! Turns out I was in denial because the whole thing made it into my tummy.  I think I've found my new obsession.

I may have to come back here to redo this review. The line is long, but it could be because it was a weekend. SF wind + standing in line = cold, but it was wonderful being in line with friends We didn't try any of their famous things because we were just really tired from a whole day of exploring. The mint chocolate chip was good though. It was interesting because it wasn't green so perhaps it was all natural!? haha It's definitely pricey though.

It is not like this place needs another review. But here's my advice: If you loooove their salted caramel, go across the street to their market and buy a pint of it (it comes in larger sizes, too!). I really like the vegan Chocolate Coconut (which was also available at the market when I was there last). Also, the kids size scoop or whatever is really not that small. It's the way to go if you're pretty full from your last meal.

Part of the "charm" of Bi-Rite is waiting 40+ minutes in line for ice cream. (The ice cream is worth the wait, as well as bragging rights in telling/complaining to your friends that you waited 40 minutes for ICE CREAM). If you want to bypass this process, walk a block over to Bi-Rite Market, grab a pint of your favorite flavor from the freezer in the back, and wait 10 minutes at the checkout line to pay. No more complaints.

The first time I had Bi-Rite was at the 2010 SF Street Food Festival where I tried the strawberry balsamic ice cream sandwich. The strawberry balsamic ice cream was kind of a let down because I didnt get any balsamic flavor at all, just mostly strawberry which fortunately was still pretty good. The sugar cookies sandwiching the ice cream were also very moist and yummy. More recently, I went to the creamery and tried roasted banana and mint chip. Both were flavor packed! The banana bits running through the roasted banana made the flavor that much more special. While I can appreciate caramel, although I'm not a big fan of it, I found the salted caramel to be too bitter of a flavor. The layout of the creamery makes it easy to get in and out with the roped off line area that leads to the ice cream case which is next to the register. Once you've got your cone(s)/cup(s) or any other sweets in hand and have finished paying, you have the option of sitting inside or on their outdoor benches, if crowds permit.

Been here twice so far. The first time I went after spending hours at Dolores Park. It suddenly got windy, then the clouds came so I thought "I'll try the ice cream place, I bet its dead right now in this shitty weather"--WRONG! Looooong line. But it was so worth it!  They're nice about letting your try whatever flavors you want before you decide. And you can still get two different flavors if you get a single scoop. Salted caramel is pretty good... balsamic strawberry...of course cookies and cream and mint chip are always good choices. Just remember if you go and there is a long line: it moves fast and its WORTH IT! P.S. Chocolate chip walnut cookies are good too

I can't believe I didn't find this place earlier! Being a SF foodie, it was sooo sad when my socal friend had to take me here. This place is known for using organic ingredients. They are pretty strick about closing on time, and we barely made it there before 11pm on a saturday night. Someone came out and cut off the line, so if you're not in line by 11...you'll be left empty-handed. A single scoop at $3.25 gives you an option to choose up to two flavors. Basically, they give you two scoops that fill up your cup. I chose Balsamic Strawberry and Mint Chip. Also, they offer Soy Chocolate, which gave my friend (who's allergic to dairy) something to be excited about. The texture and flavor make their product stand out from its competitors. MMMMMMMM SOOO GOOD! Each time you make a purchase, you get a stamp. And 10 stamps will earn you a free scoop. This place gives me a reason to drive all the way out to that neighborhood. Tip: this would be a great place to go to the next time there is a movie-in-the park at Dolores Park.

Oh! SO TASTY! We tried both the Salted Caramel and the Malted Vanilla. I -really, really- liked the Malted Vanilla, and the Salted Caramel was quite delicious as well. I understand there is a war between aficionados of Humphry Slocombe and Bi-Rite Creamery. OK, people, there's no need to squabble! Both are so, so tasty. Humphry Slocombe is obviously more adventurous with their flavors, Bi-Rite may be a tiny tiny bit better on the quality consistency. I love them both. Lots. Nom.

Do you think bittersweet chocolate ice cream, sea salt and bergamot olive oil sounds like a good combo?  Your answer should be YES!  This place has some of the most unpretentiously inventive ice cream it's been my pleasure to try.  Salted carmel?  Yes.  Early gray tea?  Yes.  Snickerdoodle?  Yes.  Eat them all, eat them often, and then run afterwards so you don't turn into a fat-ass. I wish I could give a bonus star for how close this is to Delfina's and the park.  What a lovely little triangle.

So I think everything that can be said already has but...the Peanut Butter Fudge swirl is the BEST flavor ever. Clearly Bi-Rite is the best damn ice cream, but I have a few critiques. 1) The line is always waaay too long--even when you go at "off" times. 2) It's price is unfortunately, and like most things in SF, more than it need be. My Solution: Skip the line and buy a pint from the freezer! You get more bang for the buck, and honestly, you know you could down a pint, no prob.

I'm not really much of an ice cream fan, but since I was in the area and Bi-Rite is pretty much legendary, I was pretty much obligated to try it out. After giving the flavors a quick glance, I asked to try the white chocolate raspberry swirl, obviously because it sounded amazing. I think the spoonful I got was 97% raspberry and 3% white chocolate, since I tasted only the tartness of the raspberry. Not wanting to be a jerk and ask for another sample, I decided to just order a small malted vanilla crunch, another flavor that sounded like it was a slam dunk. I love my vanilla, but it seemed like the malted-ness of it masked most of the vanilla flavor. It was still pretty good though. My friend got the salted caramel and that was a clear winner. Like I said, I'm not the best judge of ice cream since I don't fiend for it, so Bi-Rite gets 4 stars for good interesting flavors.

Watch out mitchells!  i came here after my amazing girlfriend took me to delfina's down the street. this place is amazing. there is usually a line but its so efficient you are literally still deciding what to get when it is your turn so you feel pressured to choose!  but they got crazy flavors like vietnamese sandwich or balut.  its crazy! i got the salted caramel and my girlfriend stuck with mint chip.  i cant really say much but its facking delicious. if parking wasnt so bad to get here, i would probably weigh 240 pounds at 5ft 7in.

My experience comes at the soft-serve counter on a Sunday night.  We approach to find that there is a small line.  I overhear the girl at the counter saying they only have a couple cones left and "I'm not sure there is even enough for you all."  As we approach the window I mistakenly point at the pints flavors and ask "Are these all the flavors you have?"  I'm not a Bi-Rite regular, so don't know how everything works.  She then tells me the three flavors they have and repeats (as she sticks her head out the sliding window) what she said earlier.  At that point, I'm over it. I had the ice cream before, it was nothing to go crazy for and I'm not a huge fan of soft serve, so with the combination of poor customer service, I decided there was no need to spend my money there.  If you're out of ice cream and were supposed to have closed four minutes ago at 9pm, just do like most places do, "I'm sorry, we're closed for the night."  Saves all of us a lot of trouble.  Thanks.

These people seriously know how to make ice cream.  The texture is perfect..creamy and smooth, and the flavors...wow.  We tried the salted caramel, cookies-n-cream, chocolate, and coffee toffee and all were delicious. Minus one star for the guy at the register.  He had a bit of an attitude that was a turnoff, but I'll definitely keep coming back for the ice cream.  I'd like to try the ice cream sandwiches next time with their freshly baked cookies.

It was 9:53pm on a Thursday night. My roommate (and fellow Yelper) and a friend of mine were drinking some lovely homemade screwdrivers (Grey Goose and organic tangerine juice) when I suddenly had an intense craving for ice cream. Of course, as females, we do everything in herds, thus a minute later we were running down Dolores to hopefully make it to Bi-Rite Creamery before they closed at 10pm. We made it with one minute to spare! Out of breath and overwhelmed by the tantalizing flavors, I couldn't decide between two; not wanting to hold up the line, I ordered a half chocolate and half brown sugar cup. This clearly was the best decision, as I got two well-sized scoops, enough to ease my sugar cravings. I had just moved to San Francisco so this was my first experience with the pure joy that is Bi-Rite's ice cream. The first bite was... I don't even have a word for it. I fully expected the heavens to part and a beam of light (yes, even at night) to illuminate the divine treat in my hand. Both flavors were rich and creamy, without being too sweet. The chocolate had the sharp cocoa flavor I associate with good ice cream, and the brown sugar had the mouth melting taste that you get when you surreptitiously eat chunks of sugar when baking. Less than $9 to ease the ice cream cravings of 3 women? The best ice cream I've ever had? 3 blocks from my house? How could it possibly get any better?

This is the best ice cream I have ever had. Their Malted Vanilla is the best one that I've tried so far.  The Salted Caramel was really good but ended up being a bit too rich for me after a few spoonfuls.  The Roasted Banana tasted exactly like the name, really good but not great. The Malted Vanilla was so good that I bought some to take home and ate almost half of it. I had to force myself from finishing the whole thing. Needless to say, I'm going back there ASAP for the Malted Vanilla and to try all the other flavors. Parking is not so great since it's street parking.  Don't miss their grocery store acroos the street, lots of unique and hard to find foods.

Written by my 7-year-old: The ice cream was really good. We liked the ice cream but just didn't like the soft ice cream. My sister wanted to put 5 stars and my dad wanted to put 3 stars. We really liked the ice cream because the flavors were really special and it tasted really good. There was a long line and lots of people eating outside. There were really good flavors like malted vanilla with peanut brittle and chocolate,and salted caramel. I really liked it and I want to go there the next time I come to San Francisco. I am really glad that we went there.

Parking a pain. But damn. Salted caramel is my favorite. It took me a bit to get used to this new taste because it was like eating burnt caramel, but oh boy is it wonderful. Orgasms on my taste buds. Honey lavender was too overpowered by lavender. I just couldn't take it. Balsamic strawberry was okay. I couldn't really taste the balsamic. I had a taster of the roasted banana. Wow is that thing banana-y. I also tried coffee... or was it toffee? Probably coffee.toffee  It was alright, but after a while the toffee was too much. I think i remember the coffee part being a little more bitter than other coffee ice cream. Kinda like vietnamese coffee. I'll have to try it again. I have a love/hate thing with coffee that's bitter like that. I like them sweet! I usually come between 5 and 7. NEVER a line. =)

Ah, finally. I lived around Bi-Rite for an entire year and not once was willing to wait in the constant, massive line outside the door. The time finally came and I found myself at the tail of this line (which, around 1030pm, had about 30 people ahead of me). 15 or so minutes later I'm at the front, and by this point you better know what you want- no time for dilly dallying. I settled on two scrumptious, out-of-this-world sounding flavors: Ginger and Earl Grey. Both were bomb and spot-on to their names. Normally "unique" "inspired" dishes like this come out tasting nothing like their namesake, but not so with BiRite's frozen goodies. Both those flavors (Ginger and Earl Grey) tasted just like Ginger and Earl Grey, but not betraying the creamy, sweet and smooth deliciousness of ice cream. They were so great. My friend got "Ricanelas" and it tasted JUST like Horchata! Mmmmmmmmmmmmm.

I guess you can put me in there with the rest of the 5 star reviews.  For any first timer, I have to recommend the balsamic strawberry and the salted caramel.  Two of the most unique and delicious flavors you'll ever taste!  The banana is great for those banana lovers b/c it tastes just like it! Warning:  the wait can be long.  Last time I went with my girlfriends, we lucked out b/c there was no line whatsoever.  However, I think we started the line b/c we sampled everything in the store!  I love how they are so green, using metal spoons so that they can wash them and reuse them.  Dolores park is just a hop, skip and jump away, which is great to chill and relax in the sun while you're chowing down on Bi-Rite. One of these days, when I want to treat myself out after a good, sweat-dripping workout, I'm going to try one of their sundaes.

There was a long line outside so it should be good. Bi-Rite is one of the ice cream places that everyone is raving about. It sure did not disappoint me. There was a long line for the ice cream who wanted to have it in a cone but since I was in a rush, I beat out the long line by going inside the place and picking up a "pre-made" pint or quart ice cream in their refrigerator. I heard that salted caramel is good so I have to buy it. Be prepare to dish out 7.99 for the pint or 15 dollars for their quart. The first bite is heavenly. It does not taste any of those super sweet ice cream. Its taste is a sweet, smooth, creamy, buttery, roasted caramel with a hint of salt. Once I had a bite with it, I cannot stop savoring it. I would not mind having it again, get in the line to feel the experience of waiting in the line, and try their other flavors.

This is my second time trying Bi-rite and I just don't get the hype. I purchased two pints and they were full of air. I used to make ice cream at a  boutique ice cream shop in New England when I was a teen; I can tell when base has tumbled in the Emery Thompson too long. When I pay $8 per pint I want a dense product not frozen whipped cream. i feel ripped off AND I waited in line to get ripped off; hence the one star. The pints at Mr. & Mrs. Miscellaneous are much heavier.  In terms of flavor, the mint chocolate chip lacked a strong mint flavor. I grew up with premium ice cream (Steve's, Ashley's, local farms etc..) so the fact that the mint ice cream is not green does not impress me. The toasted coconut was also lacking flavor. Even Mitchell's macapuno is much much better. I have a problem with them calling themselves a creamery since the base is from Strauss' like every organic ice cream place in the City. If you you aren't a dairy you aren't a creamery. Many people have already said its not worth the wait I think it is not worth the calories.

I was skeptical at the sight of a line wrapping around the block on a cold summer SF night.... But looking at the numerous yet unordinary flavors on the menu being passed around sparked my curiosity. Still thinking to myself, why does my wife drag me here.. it's just another local ice cream shop. Boy, was I wrong. I ordered the toasted banana with honey lavender while my wife order coffee toffee with salted caramel. These ice cream are FREAKING amazing. Light texture yet rich in flavors.. It was absolutely delightful. The lavender has this perfect balance of being a cool, refreshing dessert while the salted caramel was so flavorful. The toasted banana was awesome, and the coffee toffee was like drinking an high-end coffee with a drop of toffee that brings out some sweetness. I walked away with an extra pint of brown butter pecan for the rest of the week. Definitely would go back... Even with a line wrapping around the block on a cold summer SF night.

There will always, ALWAYS be a line. That's just the way it is, and that should be enough of a review. But I will add that, in addition to the fabulous normal ice cream (I won't even bother to elaborate, just go), there are also great dairy-free options! I recommend getting over to the street in the early-evening mid-week (so that you have a chance at a table) for dinner at Pizzaria Delfina, saving some room for dessert and ambling down the block to Bi-Rite Creamery. If it's cold, suck it up or sit in a car or just take it home--or you can try to grab one of the few seats they have inside the little space. If it's warm, you're in luck, cause you can sit outside, but the line will also be astronomically long.

This place is awesome. Although I love the other famous ice-cream place in the city too (humphry slocombe) Bi-rite is open late, at least later than H.S. so it gets 5 stars! The ice cream is delicious too. My favorite is earl-grey, it was sooo yummy!! and I also really enjoyed their Lavender Honey. This place also has a line out the door every time even if it's freezing outside. It's really small inside too so it's hard to get a seat, sometimes you have to eat out on the sidewalk but it's worth it. I would normally think the scoop is a little expensive for the size but because the flavors are so unique and delicious I don't mind paying for it. The Hubby and I come here alot at night and we've never had a hard time finding parking but I don't know how it is during the day.

Where to begin with this place! I was expecting for it to be a line around the street but guessing by the weather earlier, and for it being early spring, ice cream wasn't really a top choice for people on a cold late afternoon. But Ice Cream is a perfect time throughout all the day for me! Took some friends out on a day trip out here and was a little bummed because I wanted to find some good eats but that wasn't the case with some of my friends. I should have whipped out my phone and jumped on Yelp to get some spots. After we ate at a restaurant chain in Union Square, we were pretty much done and was going to finish the Night in San Jose. Well good thing I was driving because I was craving dessert. Thanks to my food/beer partner in crime I was led to this place. I had a feeling if I told her I didn't come here she would have been mad (somewhat) only because I'm basically a step away from the place. Well parking was the tricky part. I was so determined to find parking that I circled the place about a dozen times. Not giving up luckily I found an opening and got my car to fit that spot. We did a little speed walk and got there. Felt a little stupid because there was a window outside and apparently it was coffee and soft serve ice cream. I needed to make my way 2 steps forward and that's where the mother load is. Get in there and the place smells like ice cream heaven. Smelt like fresh waffle cones being made. Looked at the menu and was sure I had died. I already knew what ice cream I wanted and that was the Snicker Doodle Ice cream, that's my favorite cookie so why not have it in ice cream. Sampled quite a few and was sold on the Snicker Doodle and the Coffee Toffee. Hands down the best ice cream I've tasted so far. So creamy and rich and all that goodness. For sure when I'm in the Bay Area I'm going to try and make an effort to make a stop by no matter what weather it is. I'm pretty sure in the summer time it gets ridiculously busy. But for this ice cream, I'm willing to wait. MMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!

Wow just had the Dainty Gentleman and it was absolutely amazing 5 out of 5!  This sundae is a lot like their signature Sam's Sundae.  It has two scoops of honey lavender ice cream, covered in hot fudge, blood orange olive oil and maldon sea salt.  If you are a fan of salty-sweet than this is for you...but if you like just sweet you may want to pass.  The honey lavender was so tasty and deep.  The hot fudge was rich but not overly sweet.  The blood orange olive oil works better here than the olive oil in the Sam's Sundae.  It has a nice light burst of orange that I found very pleasant and the sea salt balanced it all out.  It added a nice saltiness that brought out the flavors of all the other ingredients.

Ice cream. Yum. Lots of unique, gourmet flavors to choose from. It's more expensive than your typical ice cream scoop, but I think it's worth it. The famed salted caramel is delicious, but got a little too sweet halfway through. I love the coffee toffee though and I'm glad I had that to balance the sweetness of the salted caramel. It's close to Dolores park, so if you're lucky to visit sf on a nice sunny day get a scoop and enjoy it in the park.

So, there's a Church just around the corner which my BF and I go to on Sundays. For some reason, we always tend to make a stop at BI-RITE before or after Church. I'm starting to think my BF is using Church as an excuse for a chance to get some of this DELICIOUS ice cream! We have been here almost every Sunday now that I'm a little embarrass to check in each time because I'm suppose to be on a diet! shhh! =X But, we just can't resist! The salted caramel and the coffee toffee taste so heavenly with their freshly whipped cream and bittersweet hot chocolate. The malted vanilla with peanut brittle is good when you get enough of that peanut brittle with each scoop. It doesn't matter how freezing, windy, chilly, and cold it is outside, Bi-Rite always has a line. But, if you don't want to wait in the long line, just go straight in, open their fridge, and grab a pint of your choice. You don't have to wait in line for the pints. If you can't finish it, save the rest for a midnight snack! GENIUS! ;0) I still have some left in the freezer. On second thought, maybe not! BF might have beaten me to it.

My recent favorite flavor is the roasted banana, but you really can't go wrong. Bi-Rite has just the right balance between delicious, intense, creative flavors and smooth and creamy texture. The taste combinations at Humphry Slocombe and Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous might be more inventive. The texture at Mitchell's can't be beat. But for an all-around SF scoop experience (and if the line isn't too insane), Bi-Rite is definitely the best.

This is hands down some of the best ice cream I've ever had. And for $3.25 for the single you actually get a good amount--I always get the bowl. :) The salted caramel is good, definitely. But I'm going to say it isn't my favorite. THe Brown Sugar and Ginger Caramel Swirl and the Ricanelas (which they don't always have--but it's basically cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodle cookie pieces in it) are absolutely my favorites. Highly recommend those.Especially together! The roasted banana is AWESOME if you like banana. Honey Lavender is weird, but tastes like how you would expect. As toppings go, I tend to get the homemade graham crackers. SO GOOD. The line moves fast... kind of. Just accept that there will pretty much always be a line and wait in it and be happy because there's some glorious ice cream at the end. The service there is always super friendly and awesome. I don't know if I could live in SF if there was no more BiRite.

Let me preface this review by saying that I like Bi-Rite's ice cream a lot, and that I've been a regular customer for more than 7 years now. But this past weekend, I was terribly disappointed. Some friends were visiting from Boston, and when I was considering what San Francisco must-see's to share with them, one of the first places that came to mind was Bi-Rite. It's such a special place in my mind that I wanted to make sure that my friends experience what I have been able to enjoy so often for so long. But when we arrived at the door, we were turned away rudely by one of the service staff (he appeared to be one of the clean-up staff). Yes, we arrived at 10:05, five minutes after closing time. But the doors were open, and there was still a line 4 or 5 patrons deep. I pleaded with the man, trying to explain how special an opportunity this was for my friends, but he refused to budge, and went as far as to say, "I don't care - I want to go home." The folks behind the counter were clearly still helping out a line of patrons, and there was no one waiting behind us. We ended up walking away, with a poor taste in our mouths. I understand that I am describing a story where I was asking someone to go beyond the normal expectations of their job to help a stranger. Perhaps I was asking too much, and perhaps I am unfair to generalize my reaction from one interaction to the whole store. But this was a very disappointing experience, and it very much tarnished my feelings about this store. I hope the Bi-Rite will have the opportunity to read this review and assess the service levels of its staff.

By now I'm sure everyone has read about Bi-Rite's famous salted caramel ice cream. Well believe everything you've heard because it is phenomenal. It's unlike any other caramel flavored ice cream I've ever tasted and it's worth the hype as well as the wait in line. I also enjoyed the vanilla malt with peanut brittle. Along with Mitchell's, Bi-Rite Creamery is one of the best ice cream shops in San Francisco.

Great little icecream shop has unique flavors! i would recommend getting the salted caramel but if you are adventurous in getting other flavors you can try one of their many unique flavors like basil or honey lavender.  If you are in san francisco i definitely recommend you try this place

Friday Friday Friday afternoon...  1 roasted banana +1 earl grey (umm goodness) _______________ Best way to spend a friday afternoon with the bffy! But try to make it before school lets out... a lot mommies with their little scholars and students from near by schools means less seats. FYI at&t iphone gets not reception even by the windows. so don't sit inside if your waiting for a call.

Awesome ice cream!!! The line is usually out the door, but moves fast. Get any falvor with "snickerdoodle" in the name, and you'll be smiling all the way home! There are a few seats in the store, but you can also take it to go and walk to the park across the street.

The only flavor I got was their most famous salted caramel and it was horrible. It tasted so burnt that I could hardly finish it. I am a huge salted caramel fan and that was not a good flavor. I would go back to try the other flavors but the line is horrendous and I couldn't find a parking spot  for forever.

I don't know why I even bother to write a review.  There are already 3000+ of them! But O-M-G I've never had ice cream that tasted so good in my entire life!  I grew up on Baskin Robins and loved it.  Little did I know what I've been missing out on.  I ordered the roasted banana and salted caramel in one cup.  SO FREAKIN' GOOD!  It totally lives up to the hype.

The ice cream here is very good.  But, it came as a bit of a disappointment to me.  All my friends told me how great it was, but there were too many flaws for it to inspire the kind of devotion that many yelpers give it. I really like the flavors.  They are very bold and they are a bit unique.  Salted Caramel and Roasted Banana are probably my favorite.  But, even with my favorite flavors, they miss the mark slightly.  The salted caramel is a bit on one dimensional.  It is a bit too sweet for my taste and the sweetness really washes out the flavor.  The texture is also not quite perfect.  It is a little between soft-serve and hard ice cream.  It doesn't have the lightness of soft-serve.  But, it doesn't have the body of hard ice cream.  It feels a little greasy in my mouth.  Similarly, the banana is a little one dimensional.  There is a lot of sweet banana flavor, but there is nothing complimentary that makes the banana flavor stand out.  It is almost like eating a pancake.  It is good for the first few bites, but then the starchy sweetness becomes a little boring and underwhelming.  Contrast a pancake with a good waffle that has texture and nice toasted flavors that compliment the sweetness.  That is what I think makes great ice cream. If you haven't tried it, I recommend going to try the ice cream.  It is a unique experience.  The line is very long.  The place is filled with hipsters in expensive asymetrical haircuts on their smart phones ignoring the people around them (even the people they came with).  So much whimsical facial hair and so many fedoras.  This place is also popular with cool moms who like to come to re-affirm to themselves that they are still cool despite having kids and moving from the mission to bernal heights. The cupcakes are also very ok.  They have good flavors, but are way too sweet for me.  But, the crumb is very consistent and small.  And, the cake itself is light.  The bigger problem is that the frosting is too sweet.  Actually, don't bother with the cupcake.  Just get a pastry at Tartine to go with your ice cream.

I love you, Bi-Rite but not for your Salted Caramel.. I know, everyone else does but you have so much more than just salty and sweet... THE EARL GREY!! hubbahubba, the earl grey, knocks me off my feet. Here, is my winner. Taste so legit, i love it more than the actual tea itself. Love the pineapple too! and honey lavender, and blood orange, and roasted banana and ..seriously, I think you know where I'm going with this! I absolutely adore that they sample taste with silver spoons rather than plastic ones, because people like me who are indecisive will go and try nearly every flavor and imagine how wasteful that is.. MM and their baked goods, I'd go and buy pints but when I come around here the lines so long, parking a beezy, and we're chilling around the area far too long to keep a pint for home :( XOXO, love you Bi-Rite cause you make your ice cream RIGHT!

Why aren't you closer to me, Bi-RIte? I was in the neighborhood, and I randomly looked up nearby places on yelp, and this wonderful creamery came up. I had the vegan chocolate coconut, and I swear that it just tasted like ice cream. If I were an actual vegan, I would've probably gotten nervous, question myself, and then ask the guy at the counter to make sure that it was vegan. IT WAS DELICIOUS. I didn't even think chocolate could mesh that well with coconut, but it damn sure did. Four stars simply because I've only tried one flavor and the wait was long. I'll probably update it to five once I go again and try all flavors in one sitting. Just kidding...but not really.

I have a slight addiction to all things soft sweet and frozen (think frozen yogurt, sorbet, gelato, and of course on a splurge... ice cream). OK well it may be more of an addiction since on my last fro-yo "mission" a woman asked if I was pregnant due to how passionate I was in request for yogurt! No joke! Fat Ass Alert...Heck No! I just want my fro-yo lady! Anyways, I digress... last weekend the rise in temperature demanded frozen goodness, and I knew it was the perfect reason to FINALLY make it over to Bi-Rite creamery!   Due to the heat the salt caramel was a little too heavy (but that little taste was so good I'm sure I'll be back for a cone), so I ended up getting a scoop of strawberry and cookies and cream. My boyfriend was smart enough to get the roasted banana (sooo good!). Both were delicious, creamy, and so satisfying on a hot day. We then strolled our refreshed tushies over to Tartine.... yeah needless to say bikini season isn't quite here yet and I am so grateful!

I cannot add anything that probably hasn't been said (at the date of writing this) 227 times before.  Its good.  They have boutique ice cream and likewise dessert stuff.  Its Bi-Rite.  Its by Dolores Park.  Great customer service.  Expensive but who cares...ice cream is a luxury not a right.  Real spoons for tasting.  etc etc..

We walked in and thought, "Rejoice for there are no lines!" We finished our order, turned around and there was a line of people streaming out the door. The ice cream's good, but Sam hates you and Sam hates sundaes. Salt doesn't really belong in big crunchy clumps on ice cream. Or is the salt not to be eaten? Did it serve a role in maintaining the integrity of the ice cream?  Does Sam love freezing point depression?

Many of my best friends are people I disliked upon first meeting. Now that can be extended to ice cream. Bi-Rite didn't make much of an initial impression but now it's probably my favorite ice cream shop in the entire US. I eat a lot of ice cream. I got the Sam's Sundae and a scoop of the honey lavender because I was there from out of town and didn't know if there would be a second time. After a few bites of the Sam's Sundae, I was struggling to finish it. I look back on it now and like it better upon further reflection but I can't get over the fact I ate ice cream topped with oil and salt. Did I finally reach the limits of my gluttony? Did the word "excess" actually resonate within me? Not quite. My friend wanted to return the next day before leaving San Francisco so I took her to eat honey lavender ice cream, which I enjoyed. Then I sampled and sampled. The cinnamon snickerdoodle flavor, orange cardamom, balsamic strawberry, salted caramel. Each one was a cold, creamy revelation in itself. I finally settled on orange cardamom after which my friend said "Wow, this ice cream by itself makes me sad to leave San Francisco." I came back my last night in SF and ate the toasted coconut (the best coconut ice cream I have ever eaten) and malted vanilla with milk chocolate and peanut brittle. I agreed with my friend's earlier statement. Bi-Rite, why do you have to be across the country?

This place is much more crowded about 30 min. before it closes! The roasted banana and coffee toffee were mouthwatering! I don't know how they achieve the flavor in the roasted banana, but it's so great! It's like eating an actual roasted banana, but you're licking an ice cream scoop! And the coffee toffee had BIG chunks of toffee which were YUM!

Mmmm, the ice cream here is sooo friggin good. Just how good are we talking? It was a rainy, cold December nite in SF and there was no way I wasn't going to finish my cup. The people that work here are really nice. They let us try a bunch of different flavors and they took the time to explain things. The ricanelas (it's sort of like a cross between a horchata with bits of snickerdoodles) and double ginger were my favs (i was in a Christmasy, gingerbread mood). The salted caramel was quite memorable as well (damn the 2 flavor limit for a small cup!). Try the honey lavender too, but personally, I'm not a huge fan of things that taste like flower. But it was unique, I'll give it that, and something you should definitely try at least once if you go

Good idea with the creative flavors, but the flavors really didn't pack a punch. We had the salted caramel and some sort of toffee one or something. Both were OK-- I liked the salted caramel a bit more than the other one. The cone was a bit stale, as well. Sorry that I can't go with the group on this one!

I daydream about Bi-Rite constantly: at work, waiting at the stoplight, getting my haircut, doing my laundry, during 8 mile runs, while I'm eating ice cream that isn't from Bi-Rite...you get the point.

On the Big Eat SF top 100 list... and the salted carmel ice cream did not disappoint! This was perhaps the oddest and yet most incredibly delicious ice creams I have ever tasted. I complimented it with a small scoop of the roasted banana flavor as well (by suggestion of the kind lady serving me). Decent price for a single (two small scoops) for $3.25 and a great treat to walk to the bus with after the let down at Dolores Park (see my review on the 2nd annual Norcal Regional Grilled Cheese Invitational...) Check one off the list with a smile on my face and a tasty treat digesting in my stomach. :)

Today I ate ice cream from Bi-Rite twice, once in the afternoon and once at night. Hi, my name is Claire, and I'm an ice-creamaholic. I specifically plan my day around eating ice cream. It's quite sad/fantastic. Pretty much if you have to try one flavor, the coffee toffee rocks. I also like the peanut brittle and the balsamic strawberry. I wonder, will my request on Yelp for red velvet cake ice cream at Bi Rite be heard?

I wish Bi-Rite wasn't so far away.  But I am willing to make the drive every single time.  Apparently there are people who go to church around the corner from here. How are they not 500 pounds yet? Everything you've heard about Bi-Rite is true.  Including the bit about the leprachauns.

Salted Caramel for the win.  That's it.   I know everyone loves Salted Caramel, but I wanted to try something new so I got Meyer Lemon.  WOW  It tastes exactly like a lemon tart or lemon bar filling but really creamy texture.  The cute emo glasses girl at the counter recommended it with ginger ice cream and it seriously was a winning combo. The Mexican ice cream scooper dude was also nice enough to come to the front of the counter to take a picture for me.  They're just incredibly nice people. I have to try some of their cakes some time... they have a gingerbread cake... I bet that would be mighty tasty with some Meyer Lemon ice cream in the middle!

I came here twice in the last week or so.  Addicting...if I lived in the Valencia area, this would be my greatest weakness. Flavors are unique and very creative.  Good for adventurous eating types (and even the not-so adventurous). Coffee Toffee - Is hella good.  The toffee may make it a little sweet for some tastes, but its good for me! Banana - Also hella good. It tastes like a banana flambe kind of thing. If you're going for a mix, add this to Coffee. Mint Chip - Indulging in the Asian-ness.  Its very minty! Hardly ever taste mint that has a strong mint flavor, but its so good! Vanilla w. Peanut Butter and Chocolate - I'm not usually a peanut butter fan (yes, you people can kill me now), but its really good in the vanilla.  A bit crunchy with a good texture to it.   Portions are a little small, but deal with it. Its darn good ice cream. Service - Pretty good. The people working behind the counter are just as friendly if its packed, or if there's not many people around. Plus - On weekends, if you want a pint of your favorite flavor, you can bypass the HUGE line outside to get some.  On a nice day, I'd suggest walking to the top of Dolores Park with your ice cream. Nothing beats the SF view with good food.  MmM...

Yes, definitely believe the hype! This past Friday was my first Bi-Rite experience and what perfect timing it was! We got there before the crowd officially formed around the block! I had a single combo of the chocolate love and the salted caramel. The sis had the chocolate love and the boy had the single combo of chocolate love and coffee toffee. He liked them both of them and really, it was just the perfect time to enjoy and experience their ice cream. I loved the salted caramel and will probably order it alone next time around.

I'll keep this one short because this place gets reviewed up the hizzle. Favorite flavors (in order): Sam's Sundae (ask a scoop of vanilla instead of chocolate, the bergamot olive oil and sea salt really taste good with vanilla), honey lavendar, salted caramel, ginger (in all its forms), cinnamon, pumpkin, vegan chocolate. I finally got to try balsamic strawberry, since it's a seasonal flavor. It was okay, it tasted more like plain strawberry with a hint of salt. People are awfully nice and very upbeat. Bi-Rite FTW!

Monday night was my first visit to Bi-Rite!  And all I can say is HOW DID IT TAKE ME 23 YEARS TO TRY THIS PLACE!?  It is officially my favorite ice cream shop in the city!  The Honey Lavender and Brown Sugar will be my reasons for coming back. I went with a bunch of girlfriends after dinner and we were all trying it for the first time.  Oh boy...we were such nubes! 1. "Dude, the line is so long!" (Of course the line is soo long...the ice cream waiting inside is sooo good.) 2. "What flavors should we get?"  (Well, obviously according to Yelp reviews, the Salted Caramel and Honey Lavender) 3. "Can I try this this this and that?" (The server was definitely going to kill us.) 4. "I felt so rushed! I couldn't pick my second flavor." (No excuse for this one.) 5. "The Salted Caramel was really...salty"  (My friend said that my palate is not sophisticated enough to appreciate it.) Well next time, I will no longer be a nube! This is going to be a regular spot from now on! P.S. I tried to return the next day but it was closed. True story. EDIT: I visited Bi-Rite yesterday night and Salted Caramel is actually really good!! I guess my taste buds have grown up =]

Awesome place! I love the Toffee Coffee. Although it's a bit far from my house, I'll gladly make the trip over here. All the workers are extremely nice and they don't hesitate to give you as much taste tests as you want! Although at times there can be lines for this place, but I think it's well worth it. The prices are reasonable, especially cause the ice cream is well made and it's made from all organic materials! So you can have just a little more and not feel guilty about it.

Meh.  It's not bad, but it's not great either.  I came last weekend with high expectations, willfully taking the time to find a parking spot and standing in line for 15+ minutes, given the nearly 2000 reviews averaging 4.5 stars. Sadly, I was a bit let down. The salted caramel is a bit strange to me and the balsamic strawberry was OK.  I personally got the malted vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate pieces and the brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl.  It was alright, nothing special. The prices aren't bad, though given the wait time and "meh-ness" of the flavors, I won't be coming back.

I got the roasted banana flavor, which was delicious and the earl tea flavor, which tasted like a flower. There seems to always be a line, but it goes by fairly quickly.

I'm not sure what I can add to the 2000+ reviews already written about Bi-Rite.  When we walked up at 9 pm on a Saturday night we saw the expected crowd of people lined up outside.  Lucky for us, we actually only had to wait about 5 minutes or so.  What to order?  Hold on!  So many choices and such a quickly moving line!!   We settled on the brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl and coffee toffee for me and salted caramel and honey lavender for my friend.  Did we do good with our choices?  Indeed we did.  One spoonful of the brown sugar ice cream mixed with coffee toffee and I was doing jumpy claps!  The flavors were all quite intense, distinct and well balanced while the texture was smooth and very creamy.  None of the flavors were too sweet or too salty.  A perfect way to end a meal or something to pick up as a snack (morning, afternoon, late evening). The cups and spoons are biodegradable and the cones are organic.  There are three stools inside and a few benches outside for seating.  Baked goods, popsicles, chocolate sauces, cakes, pies and pre-packed pints are available for purchase.  The staff is friendly and patient (some people seemed to be sampling every single flavor they had).  Next time I definitely want to try to the sundae with olive oil and sea salt.  Most interesting.

Honey Lavander...amazing... Despite the line out the door, it moves quickly and is worth it. Reason it moves so quickly? The people who work there are impatient jerks. Everytime I've been there, some man is working (I'm assuming he's the owner being in his 40s, working at an ice-cream creamery) is always yelling "Next! What can I get you? It tastes how it sounds, now what do you want? NEXT!" Super rude...if I want a taste then give me a damn taste or I'm keeping my $3.50! But...I always cave in and get the same thing...honey lavender is great.

You can't go wrong here! Quality homemade ice cream and baked goods but an extra star for unique flavors. I actually tried Earl Grey Ice Cream the other day. Honestly, it was not my favorite, a little strong for my taste, but I was just impressed by the creativity of it. My all time favorite is the Ricanelas (snickerdoodle with lots of cinnamon. But the coffee toffee is also really good (not for the moderate coffee lover). I also love the popsicles very refreshing! But the snickerdoodle cookies are just like grandma used to make. Which probably means they have more butter in them than I'd care to know about. Just don't tell me the details!

I like that they make organic, home-made products with local ingredients as much as possible.  I like how environmentally conscious this place is with their silverware sample spoons and biodegradable foodware.  I like the consistency/creaminess of their ice cream.  But their flavors are overrated, especially their salted caramel. Salted caramel = burnt caramel Honey lavender, coffee toffee, and roasted banana are good, and I hear ginger is great, but I wouldn't choose to stand in line for this place unless one of my friends really wants to go here.

I can't get enough of the salted caramel ice cream. All the other flavors are creative and delicious, but I always get the salted caramel (the taste of salt is very mild, rest assured). The cookies and brownies are solid, but the ice cream stands out and needs no adornment (e.g., cones, cookies, toppings, etc.). The lines appear prohibitively long, but they move quickly. Street parking is scarce, so I would park a few blocks away and walk.

There is usually a huge line out the door on weekends. But  I went with a couple of friends during the day on New Years Eve 2009 and there weren't many people. This place is delightful. They have very unique flavors and the ice cream is very creamy.  Shared the Sam's Sundae. I would recommend a tad less salt. But I love sweet and salty combinations so I thought it was overall pretty good. Waiting for another good time to go back without waiting in a line that goes around the block.

Trust me when I say that if you plan to go overboard, indulge, bomb your gut, bust your diet, feed your sweet tooth, act like a 5 year old or whatever you call your visit to Bi-Rite, know that you'll never have such a good time stuffing your face with the creamiest of desserts while walking around the Mission trying to burn it off simultaneously. We stood in line for about 30 minutes like it was the freakin' Indiana Jones ride and then once we got through the door and up to the counter it was the fastest 2 minutes that went by as I tried to sample flavor after flavor before the people behind me started breathing heavy sighs of impatience. Next time, I will NOT be deterred by sugar-fiending foodies because I deserve to savor the bliss of each spoonful because gosh darnit I stood in that line in the San Francisco cold. So why am I getting freezing ice cream? Because there's such a thing as a brownie sundae with my choice of 3 different ice cream flavors, of which salted caramel MUST be one. Not to mention, the workers behind the counter hustle their bustle and get you your ice cream pronto. Prices are reasonable for the hype and prestige surrounding this place. Here's the breakdown of the flavors I got (a list which I only hope to expand in the very near future): Cookies and cream: Great flavor, nice chunks of cookie, but probably one I would skip next time, just because of the commonality of it. Chocolate: Decadent, delectable, delicious. Salted caramel: Don't ask questions. Just ask for a sample. Then go fill a cup or cone with this salty sweet confection.

I felt like a tourist in my own birth city going in here for the first time after everyone was telling me to try it. Well I finally... and I mean... FINALLY got to try Bi-Rite's ice cream.I went for the ever so famous Salted Caramel. Well I've got only three words to tell you- MMMM MMMM MMMMM. Sweet and salty at the same time?! Now thats perfection. I've tried the lavender honey ice cream before, but I wasn't really diggin it, only because I felt like I was eating a bowl of potpourri. The people who worked there were really friendly, and the place seems to always have a line, which is a great sign of good business. I'll definitely come back and get my sister the tub of Salted Caramel when I drive there.

I came here for a late night snack a few weeks ago. Even though we came close to 10pm, the line was out the door and to the end of the block! However, the weather was nice (and warm) enough that we didn't mind waiting outside for a bit. I ended up ordering the salted caramel and coffee toffee. I have to say -- the salted caramel was my favorite! No wonder everyone raves about it. The coffee toffee wasn't bad either, though the wonderfulness of the salted caramel flavor really stood out to me. I definitely want to come back and try the other flavors! -L.

I've been to Bi-Rite a few times in my visits out to the Bay Area, and this has to be the best ice cream shop I've been to. First things first - if you're going to go on a day where it isn't that warm outside, bring something to bundle up in...you're almost always going to have to wait in line. It's also a pain finding street parking, so it's always a bit of an experience just getting down Bi-Rite. But once you get your hands on the ice cream, wow is it good. I think the worst (if you want to call it that) flavor I've had is the honey lavender, which was unlike any other flavor I've tasted. I probably wouldn't eat it on a regular basis, but the infusion of a...flowery taste with honey was unique. I'm a huge fan of the cookies & cream (very standard) and the ricanelas, which is a cinnamon lover's dream. My girlfriend is a huge fan of the ice cream, but she absolutely adores the almond toffee topping. You're going to have to wait it out to get your ice cream fix, but it's definitely worth it. If you're visiting San Francisco, find a way to take half an hour, maybe an hour, to head out to Mission District and hit up Bi-Rite. If it's a nice day out, you can just walk on over to Dolores Park and savor heaven in a cone (or cup).

Forget the line! Head over to the Frozen Yogurt counter! The flavors frequently change. I got the salted caramel swirl--a mountain of creamy, melty, delight piled high on my tiny cone. I licked my happiness away. I tried Sam's sundae-- do it only if you're in the mood to be adventurous. Too salty, too chocolately, too oily! I guess that's what I should have expected...but this was the first time a sundae went unfinished. Mishaps happen! But I assure you, the frozen yogurt never fails.

Bi-Rite is top notch. Personally, I like it better than Mitchell's. I would say it's more comparable to Ici in Berkeley, in terms of the flavor variety. I really enjoyed the salted caramel. It's a lot sweeter and less salty than I was expecting. It was actually a lot better than Ici's "burnt caramel" flavor in my opinion. I also stopped by their soft serve stand. That would probably earn 4 stars..it was good, not as great as their traditional ice cream. Prices are fair. $2.25 for kids size (one scoop), $3.25 for small size (1-2 flavors) and somewhere in the $4-$5 ranges for the medium & larges. I would highly recommend this place! But..parking is a toughy!

I heard about this place from a coworker and I had to try it out.  I was told they had many different flavors to choose from and the following three flavors I had selected were referred by my fellow friends. I only tried the salted caramel, earl grey and honey lavender topped with blueberries and macadamia nuts.   1.) The salted caramel tasted like caramel popcorn, which was the exact flavor I was imagining when I had read the name and took my first bite. 2.) Earl grey tasted like the earl grey tea.  It was really refreshing,. reminded me of drinking a black tea unsweetened from Starbucks 3.) The honey lavender was bLEHH,. the taste reminded me of being in a bathroom; the taste/smell of bathroom spray. Bi-Rite served up some unique flavored ice cream, that I had to take two scoops of the salted caramel to go and have the *FAT BOYS* try it.  They LOVED IT!   Def a place I will be coming back to

Yeah, so when someone I think of as a complete moron told me that I had to have the roasted banana ice cream here, I totally blew it off.   Turns out even total morons hit the nail on the head every once in a while and roasted banana ice cream rocks my world.   I went with Will W who had the clever idea to add creme fraiche ice cream to our sundae.  I often see lines here and now I know why.  I'm not advocating anybody wait more than 3 minutes here because really at the end of the day it's just ice cream not like cake or something...but it is certainly worth trying.

I loved all the unique flavors here! It's such a fun place to check out, especially on a sunny day, and so close to the park as well! I wish I had gotten to try the Balsamic strawberry but I felt bad getting as many samples as I did in the first place.. but everything was so good! The honey lavender was amazing, and the mint chip although not unique was perfect. The salted caramel was just ok, but I loved the malted vanilla with pecan brittle and milk choc fudge. Heaven. Even the brown sugar with ginger crystals was great. We are fatties and foodies and couldn't resist this place. We HAD to go back for seconds, we just had to.

Dear Mitchell's, I'm having an affair with Bi Rite and I just can't choose between you two. I'm torn, I tell you. Torn in half. You're an old standby for Filipino flavors, but when have you tried something new? Bi Rite trills and excites me with roasted banana, brown sugar, and strawberry balsamic. When was the last time you did strawberry balsamic for me? I can't think of a single instance and quite frankly, I need that kind of excitement in a ice cream shop. I guess what I'm saying is I'm at a cross roads. I'll admit, your parking lot is pretty sweet, but it's alway full on hot night. I need to go out and try new things and experiences. Maybe once I try Bi Rite's salted caramel I'll decide. Until then, I'll call you. I take that back, maybe I'll text you or meet you somewhere like Pacific Super so we can talk it out. Christine

It feels futile to review this place as it has the gravitational pull of SF behind it, but I just want to make one more pitch for the soft serve...because some kaboshers in my sphere of influence (as in, those who influence me) had been naysaying aforesaid soft serve, saying it was just "ok" as compared to the hallmark hard stuff. Well, I'm here to officially kabosh the kaboshers and say: the soft serve ROCKS!! The basic flavors are indeed great, and how nice that the hallmark salted caramel is also a SS option! Consequently, the soft serve line, which only a few months ago was in its embryonic stages and functioned as a quicker alternative to the nearly omnipresent long line for the classic stuff, has also grown into a Line of Its Own. And well worth it. Life has truly zenithed when it's a sunny Sunday, the park beckons nearby, and a cup of melting sweet creamy Bi-Rite goodness sits in your hand. p.s. the service is awesome too, btw - always friendly, prompt and anticipatory...but I am vowing to never regress to my lethal habit of taking home pints...

Still on the quest to complete the Big Eat! Salted Caramel:  This is creamy, salty and burnt tasting with a bit of a grainy texture and smooshed together in one heavenly scoop of perfection. Chocolate Coconut:   This is my favorite even over the salted caramel.  I wish I could get an IV of this injected into my veins every morning. It's vegan, and I have no clue how you make ice cream this good without milk or eggs. Ricanelas: Ohhhhhh cinnamon and snickerdoodles!  I tried this one, but I imagine that if you got a full scoop, you would be chunks of snickerdoodle in every bite. Roasted Banana: This was the only one I didn't like...it was way too banana-y for me. Balsamic Strawberry: A creative flavor, but I don't think I would ever order a scoop of it.

I love Bi-Rite! I don't mind waiting in line for food so long as it's great. Having said that, you'll never hear me complain about waiting for Bi-Rite's ice cream. I can hardly contain my excitement as I get closer and closer to the front of the line. I appreciate that the staff is always patient with me when I ask if I can try different flavors and continue to be patient with me as I stand there battling my indecisiveness. I usually go with a single with two flavors. Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Chocolate Pieces - My favorite! The crunchiness of the peanut brittle adds another depth of texture and flavor to the creaminess of the ice cream. Coffee Toffee - You'll like this if you enjoy a more subtle coffee flavor. I prefer a more intense coffee flavor in my ice cream. ( Humphrey Slocombe makes a great Blue Bottle Coffee ice cream.) Toasted Coconut - I had a sampler. There was a very slight nutty taste and the coconut was very refreshing. You can't go wrong with the Salted Caramel and Brown Butter Pecan either. Just thinking about it is making me salivate...

Alright so everyone and their baby mamas have probably reviewed Bi-Rite, but hey, I figured I come so much that I might as well add to the luvin'.

I'll have to give a fairer review when I actually buy my own scoop, but here is my rating of the licks gleaned from generous friends. Not much to say, except perhaps, wayy better than the overhyped Ici. The prices about match up, but the similarities end there. Yes, Ici is more warm, inviting and precious. They do give you homemade cones w/ a small bite of chocolate ganache at the bottom. But at Ici's, I feel like I'm paying out of my ass for Alice Water's namesake. The flavors read like a perfumery rather than a dessert shop. In contrast, Bi-rite is a little less pretentious, a little more homey. I tried the malted vanilla, the coffee, and the strawberry sorbet. The former two were creamy and distinct, and not too overbearing. The strawberry sorbet tasted like fresh strawberries... but frozen and pureed! Still, the price is steep, and I can't get over the name... Bi-Rite. It sounds like a discount grocery outlet rather than an artisanal ice creamery. Bottom Line: For those bad, bad days when you really need a pick-me-up without the hangover.

I'll keep it short since this place has plenty of reviews -  I think the ice cream is very good but I have had better in Scottsdale, AZ. I had the salted caramel (very good), creme fraiche (very good) and brown butter pecan (not that great). The reason I believe Sweet Republic in Scottsdale is superior is because the texture of the ice cream is better and they have homemade waffle cones. I thought the prices and service were good, better than I expected. After I got the ice cream I was walking towards the Bi Rite market to check that out when I passed the "soft serve" window with a bunch of cupcakes in the window. I bought a salted caramel cupcake which was out of this world! It survived a day in my laptop bag and still tasted delicious.

I've never been a fan of sweets, or long lines, or traveling anywhere far with busy streets to get something I don't even really like. However, after getting a gift card here, I couldn't resist but to try the place. I read reviews here to try flavors like salted caramel, honey lavender, and other flavors that I am just not used to. I came here with two friends and we got different flavors to try. I stuck with something close to "normal" flavors and I got malted vanilla with peanut butter brittle, and balsamic strawberry. My friend got honey lavender and another friend got honey lavender. Tried them both, didn't like it as much as my own. However, I will say the ice cream was better than other places I've had. The ice cream was SWEET and CREAMY and deeeeeeeeeeelicious. I have a pint of ice cream waiting for me in my freezer, PEACE OUT!

The salted pecan toppings got me! Of course I gotta try this salted caramel ice cream everyone's talking about. Pretty darn good! The honey lavander was very good too! I'm surprised at how strong the scent was. Just don't get it with other ice cream flavors, the herb scent kinda throws everything off. Though the ice cream itself is not the bestest ever, it is darned good and the toppings and fudge were awesome so the resulting sundaes are definitely worth making the trip and lining up for. Aside from the build your own sundae with the aforementione flavors, we had the brownie sunday and the banana split. Very good. Also had the roasted banana ice cream and chocoloate ice cream. If I didn't know the flavor, I wouldn't recognice the banana or the roasted in the roasted banana ice cream. Chocolate was good though. But of course, cant go wrong iwth that!

This place is incredible. This is one of those "I can't believe I JUST discovered this place after living 21 years in the bay area" kind of places. I'm normally not too big on ice cream. Whatever comes from the grocery store is usually good enough for me. But this place put my ice cream taste buds into a whole new perspective. The first time I came here, I decided to be adventurous and order Sam's Sundae, because I was so intrigued by having olive oil and ice cream mixed together. No way that would taste good I thought, but my friend was telling me that it was on the Food Network before so I had to give it a try. Oh man this was one of the best things I've ever had in my life. It felt like I had every single taste in my mouth at once. Sweet from the ice cream and whipped cream, sour and  salty from the sea salt, bitter from the olive oil. Everything cept spice, which I'm kinda glad wasn't there. The second time I came I got a Ice Cream sandwich with peach ice cream and sugar cookies. Oh man the cookies were amazing and the ice cream was super smooth. Made me wish I hadn't shared with a friend so I could've been a glutton monster and had the whole thing to myself. My only gripe about this place is the super long line, even up till closing. Waiting in line during a cold night in SF isn't all that fun, but the end result is worth it. This place literally puts a smile on your face that will stay there for the rest of they day. Did you just have a good day in SF? Then end it right by coming here. Did you just have a bad day in SF? Then turn it into a good day just with one visit to this ice cream shop.

We had an ice cream contest at home to figure out who really has the best ice cream...Mitchell's or Bi-Rite. The winner? Both. We figured out that Mitchell's is great for when you want to go out for a traditional ice cream cone while Bi-Rite seems more fitting for a fancier affair. Who can choose sides when the contenders are ice cream anyway?

I need to try more flavors - but i don't live in SF anymore - so the process is a little slower ... I'll get there :)

In the City after a return trip to a newly beloved Peruvian restaurant for dinner, I announced that ice cream would be our dessert & the girlfriend agreed when I proposed a trip to Bi-Rite Creamery. I actually had not been to this well known ice cream institution yet & was looking forward to trying their stuff. After walking up the street a block or so from where we parked, we were greeted by a sight familiar to any ice cream worthy of merit. There was a line out the door & down the street. Service was pretty speedy, however, as we ordered & were served our ice cream scoops before long. The girlfriend got a single scoop of Balsamic Strawberry & I also opted for the Balsamic Strawberry plus a scoop of Craime Fraiche. It was yummy. It was, in fact, really, really yummy-creamy-smooth delicious. In terms of Bay Area ice cream power rankings, though, I feel there is better. For me, nothing has bested the little shop in Berkeley run by the former Chez Panisse pastry chef. As good as my 2 scoops from Bi-Rite were, there wasn't quite the same subtlety & depth as the ice cream from my #1. Of course, this is only the difference between really, really good ice cream & really, really, really good ice cream. There's some yummy ice cream at Bi-Rite, for sure. While it's not my absolute favorite, Bi-Rite Creamery is one of the best ice cream shops in the whole Bay Area. When in the City, Bi-Rite is an excellent choice for really, really good ice cream.

it's good ice cream but I just don't see how it is the best. I imagine a 5 star ice cream to have a unique flavor that fills the mouth with an aroma to match. It seems like this may be the best you can get in the bay area but I believe an ice cream can get even better. Sure the salted caramel and the peach flavor on a cone were good but I wasn't jumping for joy like others. It tastes better than your normal ice cream but I was not floored... 1/4 floored I guess.

LOVE LOVE LOVE Bi-Rite. There's something so simple and so amazing about this place. Went there on Monday with an old friend, after going to Humphrey's and got the Honey Lavender and a pint of Mint Chip. He got the Balsamic Strawberry and something else that I can't seem to remember. The Honey Lavender was delicious, and the Balsamic Strawberry was surprising good. The staff there is always sweet (pun intended), and one of them was super patient with the group before us, as the guy didn't know which flavor he should get. Plus, it's not bad that it's always sunny around there. Makes your ice cream experience that much better!

I must admit that I have heard people talk about this place for ages, but the "Bi-Rite" name just kept registering in my head as bad grocery chain type ice cream. Boy, was I wrong.  Just a bevy, nay, a cornucopia of flavors to try. Our server was great even in denying my bid to have him dip my brown sugar and candied ginger caramel ice cream cone in pistachios.  The store is typically tiny (for SF), so someone in your party should scope out some seating pre-ordering if you don't want to eat outside. Is it the best ice cream I've had in the Bay Area?  I can't say for sure.  I do like the variety of non-standard flavors. Also, and I don't know if they are separate from the ice cream store, there is a little window to order cupcakes.  I had a Boston Creme Cupcake that was really filling.   Not quite as good as a Boston Creme Doughnut from Dunkin' Doughnuts, but a nice little substitute..

the salted caramel ice cream is probably one of my faves... there's just a touch of magic thinking it's sweet and then a rush of saltiness comes running through after... it's awesome. What i also like about Bi-Rite, is they sell all these amazing dipping sauces of different flavors! i tried buying a jar of the dark chocolate sauce and it was so great with strawberries and as i would hate to admit, i would dip my finger in it and just eat it by itself. (totally savage, i know). I came here when there was a LGBT festivity going on at the park, and boy this place was packed! the line was extremely long...but theyre really fast here...so it was all worth it for my scoop of fatness.

It is pricey but for good quality and one of a kind flavors I can see why, in this economy I'd suggest that they cut down the price a bit. This place is like a mini boutique of yummy ice cream!!!

the Sam's Sundae- chocolate ice cream with sea salt and bergamot oil is divine. Salted caramel is super good too!  All worth the wait in the very very long line

Huge fan of the ice cream and the changing flavors - not a fan of the line, though it moves quickly.  Even got a pint to bring home to hubby. Especially not a fan of rude people cutting you off to take up space on the benches to save them for the people still in line buying their ice cream.  I mean really I was finished with my ice cream and on my way before you even got yours.

A must try if you like ice cream. The line is always long, even on cold evenings. You can jump the queue by getting a pint to go, there's a separate line. I usually try to stop by if I'm ever in the Mission. My faves are honey lavendar and brown sugar. Salted caramel and balsamic strawberry are pretty good too.

yum! I tried so many of their flavors and they're all just wonderful! I even tried the one with the salt... what is it called again? Anyway... that's probably the only one that's a bit weird and I wouldn't try again. I also don't like that they don't have much seating, so you probably just have to stand outside and enjoy the street! It sucks that the lines are super duper long =\ makes me hesitant to stand there and ask to try flavors... so get the flavors you want the first time around! I had to stand in line again to order more.

I'm not really sure how I have reviewed three other ice cream places before Bi-Rite, because this the hands-down winner in the category of ALL THINGS EVER.  If Cheeseboard pizza is what I will eat as my last meal on earth, Bi-Rite's brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl ice cream will be the dessert. Expect to wait anywhere between 15 - 30 minutes at least if the weather is above 60F.  Or, you can go in the middle of winter.  You'll be able to walk right in.  Plus, the ice cream won't melt as fast - not that it's ever a problem because you will want to eat the whole thing in one cold messy bite.

ffinnaallyyyyy got to try this place. It was raining like crazy in all sorts of directions and my damn umbrella broke, but this ice cream made up for it. I had roasted banana, which might be my new favorite ice cream flavor now (sorry lavender honey). I also had some sort of vanilla ice cream with peanut brittle and chocolate, a winning combination, but not as mouthwatering as roasted banana. I guess the storm dissuaded people from eating ice cream because there was no line there!

I came here with some friends on a rainy day. Despite the cold and wet weather, Bi-rite creamery was still delicious. They make an interesting selection of ice cream flavors, salted caramel, roasted banana, strawberry balsamic, malted vanilla and much much more. Although they did not have strawberry balsamic when I went, I definitely recommend it. Good balsamic vinegar, when mixed or roasted with strawberries, really brings out the natural sweetness of the fruit. And the fact that they were able to churn the ice cream base (with vinegary) is still a perplexing mystery to me. Although, probably because I have been spoiled by Berkeley's Ici's Creamery, I was a bit disappointed by the consistency of the ice cream; it was more runny than I am used to, meaning that they used a normal ice cream base instead of a custard cream base. Also, the ice cream lacked texture, which i normally like. However, that could just be a personal preference. Overall, the ice cream was smooth and the unique flavors really came through; so I enjoyed it. Will need to come back to try their strawberry balsamic ice cream and their sundaes, for I heard that they are really good.

How can you visit SF and NOT come here? Many of my Norcal friends from school recommended I try this place when I went to visit this past winter break. I have been to Norcal a few times in my life and I wish someone had told me about Bi-Rite earlier. My friends and I went at a random hour and luckily the line wasn't too long. The place itself it very quaint and homey, just the way I like it. I got the salted caramel and the coffee toffee. Both were delicious! The salted caramel wasn't too sweet, which was nice, and the coffee toffee had the best toffee chunks I ever did taste. One of my friends tried the honey lavender which I really, really liked. It's a risk getting aromatic flavors because they could either be really good or really horrible. The lavender flavor was not overpowering at all and I could definitely taste it but also got the honey as well. One of my other friends tried the roasted banana which was also amazing! It tasted exactly what it was named, a frozen roasted banana. I also purchased some toffee chip cookies to take back home, but unfortunately, those were not so praiseworthy. They were rather hard, instead of the chewy goodness I was hoping for and also rather plain. So my suggestion is, skip out on the baked goods and indulge in a multitude of fantastic ice cream flavors!

This ice cream place is sometimes hard to get to.  Its right by Delores Park so you often see people take their ice cream over and sit in the sun on a good day.  I usually find parking on the street around the corner.  The line will wrap around the corner on a sunny day on the weekends.  They have a few places to sit and eat inside and outside.  You will sometimes have to wait 15-20 minutes to get your ice cream, but its worth it. I've had the salted caramel.  It's pretty good.  Not too sweet.  I like that its really smooth, but it melts really fast and before I'm even done with my ice cream its already melted into a soup.  They also limit how many flavors you can taste.  Roasted banana is my FAVORITE here.  I love cooked bananas and this tastes just like it but in a better texture.  The toasted coconut is also good.  Their cones are regular.  Nothing to be wowed about.  You can buy it by the pint, but I live so faraway it would just melt in the car.

OMG.  The Salted Caramel Ice Cream is hands down the BEST ice cream on this earth. It's super creamy, and buttery, sweet with a slightly salty (saltwater taffy-like) taste...my mouth is watering as I am typing this. The line gets pretty long, but it's fast-- and WORTH IT!  Definitely a MUST the next time we visit San Francisco.

After checking out Humphry Slocombe and Ici in Berkeley, I had to try Bi-Rite Creamery.  It's definitely harder to find parking here compared to Humphry Slocombe and the lines are long (but not as long as Ici's), but the wait was really worth it! A single size (1-2 flavors) is equivalent to a 1 scoop at Humphry Slocombe or Ici's.  I like the fact that we can have two flavors for the price of once flavor at other places.   I got the lavender honey and earl gray on a cone.  It was awesome!  If only it had the same chocolate filled cone as Ici's. It's a tough call but Bi-Rite and Ici's lavender honey and earl gray were equally good... the deal breaker for me is the cone and Ici's chocolate filled cone makes them a winner in my book.  With that said, Bi-Rite is a good runner up and I would definitely be back.

FINALLY FINALLY got to go. After years of hearing about BiRite I finally managed to be in the neighborhood while craving ice cream. Flavors, creaminess, service and speed put it as one of my favorites in SF. Perhaps not quite as many choices as other places, or as experimental, but what they do is excellent. I went with 3 different scoops, Coffee Toffee, Salted Caramel and Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl. Absolutely wonderful. My favorites of those three were the salted caramel and the brown sugar which went together particularly well. Their honey lavender was also very interesting as was the Earl Grey. This is definitely a place to go any time you are in the Mission.

My ever-growing muffin top can thank my trips to this block on 18th.  I mean saying no to Bi-Rite, Tartine, or Delfina when in the area is like kicking a baby English bulldog that runs up to you on the street.  You just don't do it. Focus, Nick, focus. This review is about Bi-Rite. And as it should be.  Their Salted Caramel is simply divine and erases any memories of long lines or slightly over-priced/under-sized scoops; kind of like how a taking a gf on a trip to Hawaii can make her forget about little things like neglect. Just kidding, babe, I love you! Haha, I don't want to piss off the only person that reads my reviews. Sorry again for the ADD.  To summarize, this place is a must-try when in SF.  I take out-of-towners anytime they visit; kind of like a 3-for-1 deal on great places to eat.  Come when you can, and if you see the Chinese butterball in the corner indulging himself in a pint of Salted Caramel, say hello! Crazy for: Salted Caramel, Brown Sugar, Blood Orange Not Crazy about: Honey Lavender (too fragrant) & Sam's Sundae (got too much oil in one bite which kinda ruined the whole thing)

Jeebus! Hands down the best ice creamery in SF for the time being-until proven otherwise. This place leaves me wanting for more. So much more that I would buy pintfuls of ice cream (cookies and cream) and gorge it down to the very last oreo? cookie crumb in one sitting. I absof**kinglutely love their earl grey, honey lavender and salted caramel ice cream too. So yummy! I am going to die. There is so much flavor, creaminess, and richness to their ice creams that make it so wonderful. And what's not better than to have a beautiful park, the Dolores park just one cross street away?! There, I can have my ice cream and eat it too. Ok, so the only downfall I have for this place is the ridiculous line that stretches around the block and makes it down two more blocks. Seriously, just prepare yourself to wait for a long, long time if you have the patience. And once you are there, just buy like gallons of ice cream to store you up until your next trip there. It'll be worth it.

A friend recommended this place to me, but didn't express the absolute NEED to visiti; I'm soooo glad I decided to stop in. Judging from the rope dividing the store entrance/exit, there's usually a line, but even though it was 1pm or so, we were the only ones waiting.  I decided on Ricanelas cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodles, and brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl.  Because I was on vacation, I went all crazy and had it topped with hot fudge, but the ice cream was so frickin' delicious that the fudge was completely unnecessary.  The flavors were just what was promised, and creamy and rich.  There was a vegan flavor and a sorbet, too. The inside of Bi-Rite was small but cute, and I'm guessing usually swarmed with people.  Only complaint: the water fountain didn't squirt high enough to actually drink out of.  And that's all I've got in the negativity department.  Totally worth risking my lactose-intolerant digestive system.

Discovered this place a year or two ago and have been dropping in with out-of-towners and newbs ever since! Favorite hands down is Ricanelas, snickerdoodle ice cream. They have the BEST Sundaes, berry compote is a must.

Amazing! There will always be a line no matter what time of the day you go. I brought my family here for the first time, every person trying a different combination of flavors. The ice cream is not too sweet and light, which makes it an amazing summer dessert. As a family of 4 we were able to taste almost every flavor except for a few with the Bi-Rite scoop choices. If you're hesitant about what a whole cup of a particular flavor might be, I definitely suggest asking for a sample. Have fun, Bi-Rite ice cream is delicious.

After trying Bi-Rite, I scream for ice cream- it's absolutely DELICIOUS. On a rare sunny day in SF, the line to get in was very long, but well worth the wait. I was only in town visiting for a few days, but knew I had to see for myself how amazing ice cream could really be.  My friend recommended trying Honey Lavender, and Salted Caramel...I easily scarfed down a scoop of each. The Honey Lavender flavor is the most unique and delicious ice cream I've ever had. It tastes exactly how it sounds- though eating lavender flavored anything might sound unappealing, believe me, your taste buds will disagree. The honey balances the lavender in the most exquisite dance two flavors could ever engage in (on your tongue, that is). And of course, Salted Caramel, which is amazing. It tastes like fresh caramel, straight off the stove, with a balanced, slightly salty/sweet taste...mmm. I'd love to try some of the other flavors the next time I'm in town..my mouth just waters thinking about the amazingly delicious ice cream at Bi-Rite--  perfectly creamy, all natural and organic-as the slogan goes, "good to the last lick' (or scarfed down bite/slurp)!

I don't know any other ice cream place that deserves over 4000 reviews and still have a rating of over 4 stars, or a line that literally goes out of the doors, onto the sidewalk, and around the corner. I was a little bit skeptical of waiting in line for something as trivial as ice cream, but my cousin recommended me to and so I did, I waited. But come on, seriously? I mean... It's just ice cream, right? No. Not right. This ice cream is more than trivial. It's more than good. It's so ridiculously amazingly delicious I can't even find the right words to describe it. This ice cream has put the word "dessert" on a whole new level. It's so flavorful, yet not too overpowering, yet not too sweet, yet so good, yet so cheap. I just, I can't even. Oh my God, why can't there be more Bi-Rite Creameries in the world?!?! :(

still my go to ice cream place in sf..and i've tried plenty of them. not a huge fan of the popular salted caramel (too sweet) or honey lavender (like soap)...but i do like the following flavors: -roasted banana -toasted coconut -balsamic vinegar -earl grey -almond fudge swirl (best to get when it's a new batch with the chocolate and almonds on top) also, the sugar cone complements the ice cream well without overpowering it, which i can't say is the same for other places. aside from the ice cream, the proximity of bi-rite to dolores park makes it a easy place to take visitors, and the convenient bathroom is a plus. lastly, the workers are great and are happy to let you sample flavors. note: expect to wait in lines on the weekends...out of towners!

Go on a Wednesday. No line. Best thing ever. This was good, especially for my first time, because I was able to try many of the flavors without feeling rushed by a line. I ended up getting the brown sugar ginger by recommendation of the server and my mom got the salted caramel and toffee coffee. It was 14.50 total, a little much for me for ice cream. The consistency was more gelato-like and the flavors were intense so that you didn't really need much to be satisfied. I enjoyed my cone, but would probably head to Swensen's or somewhere else if I was looking for ice cream with a more ice creamy consistency or a cheaper cone. However, I'm definitely glad I experienced it.

We made 3 attempts to go to Bi-Rite Creamery however, on each occasion the line was around the block. People were waiting behind this long red rope- a freakin red rope!!!! I was like wait , is there like a celebrity over there or maybe a club upstairs? This line can't be for ice cream? And it didn't matter what time of the day we passed by cause it was 1st in the evening when it was like 56 degrees and twice in the afternoon. Well, one things for sure the people of San Francisco love their Bi-Rite Creamery!!!!! I gave in and decided to just go to Bi-Rite Market across the street and buy some pints and enjoy some ice cream at home.... OK - I was dissppointed and here's why... --Salted Caramel- Not salty at all - it actually tasted burnt... Maybe I had a bad batch or maybe the icecream gods above decided to punish me for gossiping (Everyone gossips so it can't be that). I don't know what it was but I was so excited to try this flavor..... --Balsamic Strawberry- No Vineagar taste at all...I love vineagar so I thought this would be a little sour but it just tasted like regular strawberry ice cream. Maybe I had a bad batch again- Oh Damn it!!! Maybe I need to go to confession..... On a positive note I did try really good cupcakes from the Bi-Rite Market (see my Bi-Rite Market review)..... I'm not giving up on this place so when I return to SF I will attempt to try them again, I just need to bring a lawn chair....

The home-made ice cream here is legit! The first time I came here, I got the honey lavender and salted caramel. I loved the honey lavendar which was creamy and not too sweet, but I thought the salted caramel was just ok. Second time, I tried the strawberry with the roasted banana and OMG it was delicious! I'm not the biggest fan of bananas but the roasted banana ice cream tasted so creamy and encompassed the natural flavors of bananas! The wait is long (maybe 20 min if it's around the corner) but it's definitely worth it!

so lets talk dairy alright? alright. not very good for you, creates mucus but when you add sugar it perks it up a bit. a tad every once in a while ain't gonna kill you. so it seems it was one of the 1st hot days in SF & the line to get in was very long & it takes an eternity to get your treat. I really felt like an idiot waiting in line but I was at the point of no return & my gal pal wanted the stuff. no problem I said & we agreed it is nice enough to have on a hot day. so who walks by while in line no other than that tall star of "Glee". I don't know her name but I recognize the face. my, oh my does she love attention but everyone was cool & didn't fawn all over her but you could feel the buzz going through the line when she strolled by. that woman is very tall by the way & I'd say a minimum of 6" tall. as I gaze at the peeps all around me, I see hipster swill, happy loving couples, ditto boy-boy/ girl-girl combos & I'm thinking to myself, you are all in for some "REA" also know as *rapidly expanding ass* after you get your dairy licks in. then I try to roll with it some more & come up with this: "REAC" or ^Rapidly Expanding Ass Creme^ get it? that's @ASS CREME@ ... so a good 20 minutes finally pass & we get the dish of ice cream. we had rhubarb,ginger,malted vanilla & toasted coconut. so for 6 bucks we got 4 scoops which was just enough & not overly generous or anything but it seems like high quality stuff & the mucus buildup gave me many merry hocker ejections as I cleared my throat of the gooey dairy mucus as we walked back to the transportation unit . thanks be Satan we do not burn in HELL everyday in SF because I would NOT want to make this part of my everyday reality.

Rushed here after dinner on Sunday before they placed the "CLOSED" sign on the last person in line. It was already 9:57pm when we left the restaurant so Daughter #2 got her car and dropped us off in front. Woo-hoo...only 5 people in line and no "CLOSED" sign in sight. I ordered the single serving size with two flavors - balsamic strawberry and ricanelas (cinnamon snickerdoodle). Hubby ordered the double serving with two flavors - salted caramel and honey lavender. Daughter #2 had the salted caramel and ricanelas and BF #2 had the chocolate with the salted caramel. It had been two years since my last tasting because last year we had walked by around 9:30pm and it was chillier and there were about 40 people in line so hubby refused to wait. Sigh....I had to wait another year to satisfy my craving but it was worth it. I had forgotten how intense the flavor was on the salted caramel because I had been substituting Sweet Republic's salted caramel which is more subtle. Sorry Sweet Republic, but Bi-Rite's my #1 preference.

Yes, Bi-Rite does in fact live up to the hype.  The cookies 'n cream (my staple since childhood) was delicious -- generous chunks of cookie, and the texture of the ice cream was just right.  Also tried some of the twist soft serve, which was equally as delicious.  You can't go wrong with Bi-Rite, and apparently 4000+ people seem to agree!

A different kind of ice cream parlor from my personal fave, Mitchell's, but still really great! When I'm in the mood for more "inventive" flavors, I hit up Bi-rite. I like pretty much everything they have, but always go for the honey lavender and strawberry balsamic... amazing amazing combination of flavors! There's always a line, but it moves fairly quickly. They also offer a punch card too, which is always a nice plus. Go grab yourself a cone and walk around Dolores Park afterwards!

Hmmm, I may stand corrected - true bliss exists in the form of Bi Rite's honey lavender ice cream with blood orange olive oil, hot fudge, and sea salt. If Zooey Deschanel were a bowl of artisan ice cream, chances are, it'd taste something very close to this.

I love desserts, and so I delighted when my friends took me here during my first weekend after moving here.  The salted caramel ice cream was great.  I will say that it was probably so potent that I couldn't taste my other flavor, strawberry balsamic.  So I'd suggest ordering the caramel first, so that the scoop is on the bottom and your 2nd flavor on the top.   I'm glad I don't live near the Mission, I would go every week.

I was pretty full when I walked into Bi-Rite. But once I started tasting the ice cream, I was hungry again! Everything I tried here was pretty delicious. Any place that turns tea flavors into ice cream is pure genius to me. They use whole cream here from Straus Creamery. You can definitely taste the richness and quality. I tried just about every flavor. But decided to go with the snickerdoodle one, earl grey, and milk chocolate chai. They were all very yummy. The ice cream here is pretty decently priced too. I got 3 decent sized scoops for $5. It was a very satisfying amount of ice cream without being too much.

so my pregnant wife, who's on an ice cream craving binge, were about to head to mitchell's when i get a call from a buddy while shopping. thanks to my friend Antonio (http://Motormavens.com)  for giving me and the wife a heads up about this place. we were warned the line was going to be nuts, which it was bc of the park, waves of hipsters, and it being a sunday afternoon. after driving in circles for a million years we found a close spot and parked. me = malted vanilla (kinda plain) and roasted banana (pretty good but the magnolia turon ice cream from seafood city is comparable IMHO) pregnant lady = salted caramel (really damn good) brown sugar (too rich) overall awesome spot other than the shitful parking.

Bi-Rite gets five big chewy stars from me for its succulent cookies:   Chocolate chip Snickerdoodle Peanut Butter ... Pure heaven!   They are damn pricey, but every bite is worth it! The ice cream was created in hell.   It is so luscious, so rich, it is sinful.   Take some home, and make yourself a milkshake.  You'll never be happier!   Just make sure you go to confession afterwards.

I'm going to have to agree that Bi-Rite is pure awesome. The salted caramel is, of course, very good, but I'm partial to the roasted banana, which rivals the best gelato for pure depth of flavor, but maintains its delicious creaminess to be securely called ice cream. I haven't ever been the least bit disappointed by Bi-Rite and it's a favorite spot among visiting friends who want to experience a bit of what SF has to offer. If you appreciate ice cream, it won't matter whether it's a warm autumn afternoon or a chilly winter evening--you will rejoice in your selection after every delicious tongueful of Bi-Rite's trademark goodness.

After walking down from Dolores Park, we headed over to the raved-over Bi-Rite Creamery.  I'm glad that the wait wasn't 45 minutes that day, like so many people mentioned.   Of course I had to sample the flavors when we did get up there, though :)  I did try the salted caramel, but honestly it was too sweet for me; I don't think I could have handled more than that little spoonful of it.  I shuddered.  The ginger was SUPER gingery! I liked the ice cream; I especially appreciate that it's from local farms with organic products; how nice! And the flavors are definitely unique and interesting.   We ended up having the mango-orange sorbet and roasted banana.  Maybe I'm not so great at mixing flavors... well, I loved both!  I just thought it was slightly pricey for a sundae... but hey, gotta make that paper...

This place is crazy!  Cray-cray crazy. We tried to stop by for ice cream on Labor Day, and the line was around the block - and I was assured that this is pretty normal.  Our SF friends told us that the trick is to just go to the market down the street and buy a pint.  We tried to do that, pushing through the absolutely claustrophobia-inducing packed store to find that QUELLE HORREUR, the ice cream coolers were all broken.  Shelves and shelves of delicious Bi-Rite ice cream taunted us from behind the glass doors and masking tape barriers. Fortunately, we had one more option.  I made a bee-line for the Bi-Rite Bakery window, where I was told that you could ALSO buy pints.  No wait, no line, and in a few minutes we were happily eating salted caramel on a park bench. Bi-Rite's ice cream is incredible, and we would've definitely had more had it not been such a hassle to obtain.  I feel like I should knock of a star for the hassle, but the memory of that pint is too happily salty for me to do so.

Be still, my heart. At least, that would happen if I lived next door to Bi-Rite. Bi-Rite is hands down the best ice-cream I've had in my life. When I got to the counter, I asked what's the max number of flavors I can get in the largest cup. Of course i got the max! I shared this with my friend (kinda wished I didn't...). I couldn't believe how fresh and creamy the ice cream was. I pretty much licked the cup clean. Considering how long the lines were, I am also surprised to see how happy all the employees seem to be! (Perhaps they get to eat one spoonful of ice cream for every customer they serve). I want to try everything else on the menu... will give a update once I get back there!

ICE CREAM WITH THE BOYFRIEND. Wow. I only decided to come here because of the 7x7 100 things to try in SF before dying..well and the top 50 sweets list as well. Because of this, I decided that I needed to at least try the Salted Caramel and the Sam's Sundae. I got Sam's Sundae - it was different. Chocolate ice cream and Olive Oil? I know it's weird, but it was quite delicious. Not for everyone's tastebuds, but mine were singing and happy. My boyfriend made his own sundae with salted caramel and coffee toffee ice cream. Salted caramel is like a little bit of heaven. Thinking about it now makes my mouth water and I want more! I know that I'm not in love with the savory and sweet, but these two combinations I'm actually in love with. MUST TRY.

After chowing down on some pastries from Tartine, it's only natural to go to Bi-Rite, right? We did stop in the store first to get my stomach some time off from this punishing eating trip but it really wasn't that much time to digest since the ice cream shop is just across the street. I opted to get a small but you can pick two flavors. I got the salted caramel that I heard so much about and the brown butter pecan. Mmm, yum yum! My friend had a melon popsicle with chile. I didn't try it since I'm allergic to honeydew but she said it was great.

Bi-Rite's ice cream is absolutely wonderful.  Their ingredients are fresh and decadent.  I had their salted caramel and the rincanela's.   Each bite made me want to squirm with joy.  The salt and caramel are well balanced and the rincanela's reminded me of eating churros.  This place is well worth trying!

We were waiting for our sandwich at the deli to be made, so we decided to go on a stroll around the neighborhood. Lo and Behold, there was Bi-Rite sitting sweetly and quietly all by its lonesome. My friend informed me, shock and awe thick in her voice, that this was probably the first time in history that Bi-Rite DIDN't have a line out the door and around the corner and that I should be thanking every ice cream god I know for this rare momentous occasion. But my moment of gratitude was quickly overcome by my overwhelmingly productive salivary glands. One look into the case and I knew I was a goner. I spent the next full 5 minutes making my decision, with plenty of samples to aid the process (thanks for being so patient guy-behind-the-counter!). I finally decided on Olive Oil ice cream and man, was that one of the best choices I had ever made. Its a simple, clean flavor reminiscent of vanilla-done-right, but OH ITS SO MUCH BETTER. There was something light, yet creamy, yet wholly interesting that made me extremely happy. Next time I'm in SF, I'll definitely be going out of my way to get some Bi-Rite.

WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER! This definitely beats out Humphrey to me. I've been on the ice cream war binge and have tried all the spots in SF for a great scoop. This place is definitely the winner.... great creamy texture (not quite as heavy-cream as humhrey but lighter), more traditional flavors, and even their take home pints taste fresh made. I'm not running in for the salted caramel though.... try RICANELAS. It is this amazingly delicious cinnamon ice cream with pieces of snickerdoodle in it. Yes-- that might not sound amazing (i'm not even a fan of snickerdoodles) but you have to trust me... its out of this world.

While I do appreciate all the unique flavors that bi-rite offers such as salted caramel, roasted banana, and malted vanilla, the reason I give it 4 stars rather 5 stars is it is kind of pricey for what you get and the flavors can be a little too sweet for me. The salted caramel is super good, but it is pretty decadent and I definitely cannot have a full serving of it. The roasted banana was the same. The malted vanilla was really good, I love the little bits of crunch, and it actually wasn't too sweet for me. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but I definitely don't mind going if I'm in the area.

The line is almost always out the door, but with good reason.   The ice cream is pheonomenal.  Each and every flavor I've tried.  If I were to choose among the many great ice cream parlors in SF, this would be a first choice. Flavors I've tried: * Salted Caramel * Roasted Banana Creme Fraiche Mint Chip Balsamic Strawberry Honey Lavender * Vanilla Malt Toffee Chip * = my favorites.

I had heard good things about bi-rite, so I was excited to finally check it out. I was told to try the Honey Lavender, which I thought was a very interesting ice cream flavor, but it was delicious. The selection of ice cream flavors at Bi-Rite truly shows what a creative mind, and desire to push the limits can create. Not the traditional baskin robbins ice cream here, and that's a good thing. It's a small shop, and when I went it wasn't too crowded, but I suspect this place can get quite busy once the heat arrives. I'll be back.

We were eating down the street at Delfina. We had to park our car next to Bi-Rite and saw the line oustide. I was thinking to myself "who waits in line for ice cream?" I hadn't read about it here yet. Luckily, we bypassed dessert at Delfina and decided to see what the hype was all about. It delivered! I got a cone with cinnamon and mint chip. It was delicious and fresh - lots of great flavors on the menu. If I lived here, I would frequent this place often. It is the bomb.

My favorite place to get Ice Cream in the city. :) And it's close to Mission and Castro, so really As good as it gets! I usually just get a small because there is so much flavor you don't really need that much. All of the ice cream here is great, but I want to suggest Honey Lavender. It really tastes like how Lavender smells. So yummy! I think I'm going to buy a pint and bring it home to my little brother and sister. So yum!

Best. Ice Cream. Ever! Thanks Bi-Rite for always having at least 2 flavors for my vegan palate.   Most of the sorbets are usually amazing. The chocolate Coconut is crazy good. The pop-sickles leave me trying to lick off every drop as I make a mess out of my hands and skirt (they melt fast bc they are natural). The pomegranate one is my fav. But this weekend I had the strawberry and stonefruit with raspberries variety and it was excellent.

Just the thought of Bi-Rite starts me salivating.   Honey Lavender and Salted Caramel are a match made in heaven...that is if you like lavendar and salted caramel.  Definitely worth braving the aftermath of lactose intolerace over indulgence - must remember to buy a supply of lactaid for the next visit.

The salted caramel and honey lavender here = good. Very good. It's the sort of ice cream you would gladly lap up even on a chilly rainy day. The salted caramel is sweet and salty and it leaves an absolutely divine burnt toffee taste on your tongue. It's addictive, and quite possibly the most interesting ice cream flavour my palate has ever known. I had my boyfriend get me a pint, and I shared it with him begrudgingly.

After reading millions of rave reviews for Bi-Rite, the bf and I finally made it to the fabled ice cream shop this afternoon. My verdict? Overrated. To be honest, only the most discerning palate would be able to differentiate between Bi-Rite and Haagen Daaz. Don't get me wrong, the ice cream here is good. But it just tastes like "normal" ice cream. Some of the flavors are more exotic and original, but that's about it. Here are quick reviews of the ones we tried: Salted Caramel - Probably Bi-Rite's most famous flavor. And just as one yelper notes, you'll probably either love it or hate it. I personally thought it only tasted good for the first 5 bites. After that, the burnt flavor became too strong for me. Honey Lavender - Definitely did not like this flavor at all. I am usually a fan of floral flavors, and I love honey, but somehow, this just tasted wrong. Maybe I'm not hippie enough. Strawberry balsamic - Where was the balsamic? Beats me. Brown butter pecan - It was delicious. How can you go wrong with butter pecan? Overall, Bi-Rite is underwhelming. I'd probably only come here on a hot day if I lived close by. NOT worth a 50 minute drive.

My boyfriend had tried this place without me (the cad!) and kept pushing for us to go together.  We were THISCLOSE to actually going once this summer while we were in the City, but it was probably about 11 o'clock at night and there was a line a block-and-a-half long and we couldn't find a parking spot within a 3-block radius, so...NO. Bi-Rite was finally able to fit me into its jam-packed social events calendar for the first time last night after I had dinner at Picaro and before I had drinks at Cassanova (I thank the rain for keeping 99% of the fans at home, but true fans still made it to this frozen dairy mecca).  I tried a tasting of the honey lavender, but it was a little too Victoria's-Secret-scented-candle for me.  I ended up going for their recommendation ("great combo!") of the roasted banana and toasted coconut, while the bf-unit got the malted vanilla and Ritual coffee toffee.  Bomb diggity!  I know nobody says "bomb diggity" anymore (wait, did anyone ever?), but I know no other words to describe what I ate.  I love coconut, but the toasted coconut ice cream made me want to take it behind the middle school and get it pregnant (a buck to you if you get the reference).  And banana ice cream?  Banana is one of my favorite fruit, and now I can get it in ice cream format. I think my taste buds were invigorated by last night's Bi-Rite experience.  I woke up today, and my toothpaste tasted mintier, and my open-faced breakfast sandwich tasted more cheesy and eggy and whole-wheaty. After we had already paid, my bf said I should ask for a sample of the salted caramel because it's supposed to be The Shit.  The guy behind the countner grabbed an ice cream SCOOPER and scooped me a scoop of the salted caramel and put it on top of my cone.  WHAT?!  BAM!  5 stars.  May the force be with you.  Live long and prosper.

3.5 stars. I can't say I love Bi-rite. It wasn't bad by any means but maybe I just had too high expectations for this place.   Sad face. Oh well.  It was good just not great. I had the salted caramel and it tasted like a hard caramel not enough salt for me. And the strawberry balsamic, which personally I would rather have the real thing than settle for their frozen dessert.   Cest la vie.

I like that they offer interesting flavor combinations. and that it's located in a fabulous part of town (I like the neighbordhood charm).  In addition, I think their flavors are just vibrant.  Vibrant and NOT intense.   Who can beat grabbing a cone at Bi-Rite and indulging as you swing on the swings at Dolores Park??

This is definitely the best ice cream I've ever had. No kidding. I'm a banana milkshake freak, but I usually don't like banana ice cream because it has that artificial bananay flavor that's just icky. But this banana ice cream was incredible. INCREDIBLE. Seriously very very good. I don't really do ice cream all that often - I'd rather have cookies or cake for dessert, but this stuff might make me change my mind. It was like a mush ball of bananas and frozen yumminess that made me wonder how long I could make it last. The chocolate was just as good, as were the flavors my boy picked out. Everything was so friggin good. This is it, kids. The best. oh, and skip the cookies. They're okay, but nothing special. Stick to what they do best. :)

I don't know how my taste buds have wandered so far away from the masses and as I write this, I am ashamed of what I am about to say but the ice cream was too creamy and the flavors too intense for me. I got the salted caramel and honey lavender. I love honey lavendar in gelato form but as an ice cream, the lavendar was overpowering. At first it was delicious and then I felt my taste buds drowning in an oversaturation of flavors. And that sounds like it should be an amazing thing, but it wasn't. The boyfriend and I tried to share a double and we both had to stop and drink water before continuing. I don't know whats wrong with me but I refuse to believe my taste buds don't like sugary, salty, creamy flavor so I'll definitely try this place again and try different flavors next time.

Due to the beautiful sunny weather today, I think us and half of San Francisco had the same idea to go to Bi-Rite and have ice cream. Not wanting to wait in the huge line for the ice cream section, we opted to get the salted caramel soft-serve and dark chocolate cookies and cream ice cream sandwich. Both were equally delicious, and I'm really looking forward to tasting the salted caramel ice cream and the other flavors bi-rite has to offer. Can't wait to come back here!

It only took me four years, but I finally made it to bi-rite for a little ice cream.  Twice, actually. I have to say it was good, but not great.  The line went by quickly, the servers were as friendly as one could be when serving massive amounts of people ... but the ice cream left something to be desired.  Here are my descriptions of the five flavors I tasted: 1. Salted Caramel - My favorite flavor.   The salty-sweet combo was spot on. 2. Roasted banana - The banana part was great, but there was something off about the roasted part.   3. Brown Sugar - Another great flavor.  It's different and tasty. 4. Balsamic Strawberry - Not my cup of tea at all. 5. Malted Vanilla  w/ Peanut Brittle - There was no peanut brittle in scoop my malted vanilla and the vanilla was bland.  Maybe it was just a bad batch? *Bonus tip:  If you've never been here before, stay away from the ice cream that looks like it's only had a scoop or two taken out of the container. They're probably not that good.

Salted caramel (with brownie bits) is a MUST. I don't think I would want to try a sundae even if I could stomach it. The ice cream is so rich and filling, but also so flavorful that all that other junk would probably take away from it. Great for before/after the park.

this place is the first joint I'm yelping that has over 3000+ yelp reviews averaging 4.5 stars. It's hard for me to get into SF since I live San Jose and my life is busy as heck. So when I do make a trip up there, I do my best to eat at as many well-known places as possible. On this particular trip, I wrote down both Bi-Rite Creamery and Tartine Bakery to stop by after my lunch. Yes, that's a fatso move. So what? I come to SF like once every two months. I gotta be strategic. But after lunch, we first stopped by Tartine Bakery...but ended up ordering way too much and we were all stuffed beyond our imagination. Then we said let's just forget Bi-Rite Creamery...and plus, we didn't even know how far it was from Tartine Bakery! So we got in our cars and started driving and after two blocks, we are waiting for the traffic light to turn green and what do we see on our right side? Bi-Rite.....how can we just pass on this opportunity? Being a true fatso I am, I just got out of the car, happily rushed in and tried the samples of their salted caramel, roasted bananas and honey lavender (nothing shocking...all good).  Don't worry...you may think because I'm full, I'm just not fully experiencing the beauty of Bi-Rite but remember...true fatties never get full....and when they do say they are full, if you lure them with good food, they will still take some and fully enjoy em.   Everyone talks about salted caramel but to be honest, it was nothing new for me. I've had this growing up in South Korea....on the streets with these guys melting brown sugar (BBOPGI in Korean) and selling to sugar deprived asian kids...it brought all the memories of my childhood...stealing my parents money just to buy another bbopgi after school. all in all, it's a good ice cream place. i'm not sure if it deserves 5 stars and 3,000 plus reviews but the locals love it and i wouldn't drive from San Jose to get a bite of this so-called one of the best ice cream joints in America.

Good lord this place is a gem!  I haven't heard of such a creamery until one of my local SF friends recommended it after a late lunch. The amount of "in house made" ice creams and toppings, along with the unusual assortment of ingredients make BI Rite creamery unique in an industry where the only differentiating factor is a cold stone to mix ice cream, or a counter top....... I must try one of their Banana splits.......

You know it's good when it's cold and there's a line for ice cream. I almost skipped trying it because of the bitter wind chilling us as we waited. The guy behind us told his friends you could get some fudge on your scoop instead of a whole sundae, so I got roasted banana and malted vanilla with hot fudge. Amazing! Perfect dessert after pizza at Delfina. My boyfriend got brown sugar with ginger swirl which tastes like a creamy Ginger cookie. Mmm. Worth the chill!

Yeah, what he said and she said... 700+ reviews, here are my 2 cents which barely makes a difference or dent. Still hear me out! What were you doing on the fluke summer weekend in SF? I was in my cute short shorts and tank licking down my honey lavender ice cream on a cone. This scene reminds me of laid back Texas on a hot and steamy summer day, kickin' it with my innocent posse. Nowadays, I rarely eat much ice cream because I am usually full after 2 spoonfuls and because I have mild, late onset...you know...some of you understand what it is liked to robbed later-in-life of yummy dairy foods. But Bi-Rite creamery makes great organic ice cream, and my tummy responded a-ok. My olfactory glands were heightened by the lavender and honey flavored ice cream, which made me think I was eating my lavender scented sheets. I got used to it and fell in love with the flavor lick after lick.  Next time when I feel like reminiscing my childhood, I will definitely go for the roasted bananas, one of my friend's highly recommended flavors. The line may be long, but it goes pretty fast!

I've heard a lot of people rave about bi-rite and their organic ice cream, so it was really hyped up to me way before i had the chance to visit.  I was excited to try it but wasn't really expecting much. I got the roasted banana and the salted caramel on their hand-made cones and can i just say YUM!!!!!  The salted caramel is super creamy and sweet, but not TOO sweet.  I'm not a fan of bananas but the roasted banana ice cream was really good with chunks of banana right in there.  What a perfect pre-dinner snack this was!

Big ups to my boy Kero One (http://www.pluglabel.com) for taking us to this place!!! This is the BEST ICE CREAM place I've ever been to in my whole entire LIFE! Awesome original ice cream flavors!!! I tried: balsamic strawberry roasted banana orange cardamom toasted coconut sooooo dope!!! i think my fav was the balsamic strawberry and the roasted banana ice cream. my friend jody loved the orange cardamom, which in my opinion, tastes very similar to orange marmalade, in ice cream format. i'm not a huge fan of orange marmalade, so i wish i would have ordered the malted vanilla with peanut brittle & milk chocolate instead! what an idiot i am for missing that flavor - i didnt notice it until i already ordered and it was too late! oh well, that just means i need to go back with more friends next time i'm in SF. damn, i should just move back to the bay area already.

I've only been here once, but I was extremely impressed. I'm always pleased with an ice cream place when they've got lots of interested flavors and the ice cream isn't all sorts of weird colors. I stopped by on my bike on a hot day and got the salty caramel flavor, and ate the delicious gooey concoction under a tree in Dolores Park. It was a great day.

this place is so delicious it made me want to cry because its not in ny. The flavors from this place are so amazing and strong. The guy behind the ice cream let me try 4 flavors and even then it was hard to pick out which one to get. The honey lavender was amazing. ;_; I'll miss it.

Best frozen treat I've had in a while.  This is out of all the yogurt, gelato, and ice cream I've been eating.  And I've been eating a lot lately. I had the honey lavender and roasted banana.  I'm always a big fan of lavender, so I had to get it.  I tried the roast banana and loved it. The texture is surreal.  I don't like my ice cream too creamy b/c the mouthfeel becomes a bit weird and sort of melts awkwardly.  I don't like my ice cream too soft b/c those frozen treats tend to melt too quickly and I end up with a cup of sweet soup. The flavors are subtle.  Not excessively sweet, but not non-existent.  Just enough to keep you eating.  Who says occasional gluttony is a bad thing?  Ice cream has calcium right?  So technically it's good for you.  Technically.

Holy Crap. So I've tried several times to go to Bi-Rite, but I literally miss the closing time by mere minutes.   And now I think the people working there know who I am, the crazy lady who knocks on the window begging to be let in. When I FINALLY get a chance to go to Bi-Rite, it's yet again closed, so my wonderful wonderful husband asks the guy - please, we're moving and my wife really wants to try the ice cream here, they look to see who it is, and wave to me (as if they know me) and allow me to order "after-hours".   I'm so so so happy with my tub of salted caramel ice cream.  Thank you to 7x7 for putting this on your must try before you die list.

Love ice cream but if given the choice of any place for some leet ice cream I would opt for Bi-Rite Creamy. Amazing quality here and sharp clean flavors. Take a moment be it sunny or cloudy and visit this place and if there is a line it is more then worth the wait. My favorites, Their Ice Cream Sandwiches, something about yummy Coffee Ice Cream between two Chocolate Chip Cookies. Cakes for parties like the Brown Butter Pecan. And of course their scoops such as Roasted Banana. Get your treats and enjoy a moment outside or at the park a few steps away or just people watch and guess what everyone else is going to order.

This place is average, at best.  Yeah, the ice cream tasted pretty good, but I think I'm just spoiled by living close to Mitchell's.  Here are the reasons Bi-Rite is inferior to Mitchell's: 1. Mitchell's has more flavors and more variety of flavors. 2. Oreo Cookie is tastier at Mitchell's (this is the true litmus test of any ice cream place). 3. Mitchell's is creamier. 4. Wooden spoons???  Really???  Gross! 5. Lining up outside is not as good as the number system Mitchell's uses. Within SF, I'd say Polly Ann's is also better than Bi-Rite.  I'm glad I went to try it, but I'll probably only go back if I'm in the area anyway, with so many other superior ice cream options in the city.

The honey lavender ice cream reminds me of work, and while I love my work, the overpowering flavor of lavender and the nearly non-existent flavor of honey was just plain gross.  The texture of the ice cream leaves a weird chalky mouth feel that I found to be unpleasant, too. On the other hand, the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful and charming. But the long lines are unwarranted - if I want a long wait, I'll head down to Mitchell's instead.

It's all about the Salted Carmel= perfectly satisfying, surprising, and unique.  The great thing is, however, that even a single dish allows you to choose two flavors, so try another flavor but never miss out on the salted carmel.  Ever.  I've tried other flavors and I'm always pretty happy- brown sugar w/ ginger (not enough ginger so watch out for your expectations), creme fraiche (my second favorite), blackberry white chocolate, malted vanilla w/ butter pecan- but I always wish I at least had a little Salted Carmel.   I love that they let you try bites before you order so you don't have to blindly choose your $4 small cup and be disappointed.

Word of caution: parking sucks here (once my dad stood in an illegal parking spot while my mom and i ran inside to get ice cream. yeah so worth it). Second word of caution: their ice cream will spoil you and you will never go back to mediocrity ever again. Nevertheless, I'm just adding to the noise here. Not much new being said in my review, but it's amazing what fresh, natural ingredients can do to make a difference in creating good ice cream. Every flavor shines. I've had Salted Caramel Honey Lavender Cherry Almond Peanut Brittle The snickerdoodles one with the spanish name Balsamic Strawberry Creme Fraiche Ginger Caramel Roasted Banana Brown Butter Pecan and probably an S load of samples of all their other flavors OH crap! have I seriously eaten every single flavor in the store!? Says something about their ice cream. NOW GO.

The snicker doodle ice cream is hands down the best cookie flavored ice cream I've ever had (cookies and cream doesn't count since it's more of an ice cream flavor than a cookie flavor). This place is pricey (low scoop size to dollar output ratio), but you can taste the creamy quality in the ice cream so it's worth it. They are adventurous with the flavors but don't really rotate them often. The people behind the counter are kind and happy to help you sample several of their flavors. I have mixed feelings about the cookies and cream here. For comparison, the standard goodness is Dreyers in my book. The flavoring of Bi-Rite's is actually better. But then you know how in Dreyers you can get those cookie chunks and no matter how old you are, you get a giant child-like smile on your face when you find one? Well, I got one of those in my cookies and cream here and I smiled, but then I bit into it and my childhood memories got smashed. I expected the cookie chunk to be great seeing as how the flavoring of the ice cream was so creamy and well cookie-balanced, but it was bleh. Not spit-out or avoid the rest bad, but just not good either. All-in-all, they serve up a creamy indulgent dessert . And although I can't see myself frequenting this place, I would stop by again if I was in the neighborhood.

I happen pass by this place, saw a line, so we thought that we should try it. I got a small cone with 2 small scoops. I had cherry chocolate which was delicious, and a vanilla cookie, was good too. I tried the salted caramel, since there are a lot of people saying that it was awesome, however, am not a fan. Still too sweet to me. We had 2 small cones, and totally like 5 bucks some. The texture of the ice cream is pretty good, not icy but also not too creamy. I I would say B&J is too rich for me, after one scoop, am done, Bi-rite, I may have 2 scoops. Recommend to eat in store if you got a lot of ice cream, they get melted very fast. Overall, it is a good ice cream place, but don't hold too high expectation, it is just ice cream anyway.

You can never go wrong with Bi-Rite!  Don't be discouraged by the line out the doors, its worth the wait! If you're in a rush avoid the line and grab a few pints from the fridge to go. This place has some of the most amazing flavors (especially sundaes)  that you won't find anywhere else.  They're ice cream is always smooth, creamy and consistent. My favorites are coffee toffee, salted caramel, ricanelas (cinnamon with snicker-doodles), brown sugar, roasted banana and creme fraiche! But pretty much everything is amazing! Their ice cream cakes and s'more ice cream pie are worth the indulgence!

My friends and I walked all the way from Coit Tower to try the ice cream (we wanted the exercise). Was it worth it? Oh yes. I had a single with both the coffee toffee and the balsamic strawberry. The coffee toffee was very rich with real toffee pieces and the balsamic strawberry was somewhat lighter with an interesting subtle flavor of something else (maybe the balsamic part?). I also sampled a friend's salted caramel, which I thought was a bit on the rich side. The only reason this place gets knocked down a star in my book is because of the long wait (took 15-20 minutes waiting in line before stepping up to the counter) and the price. I didn't expect it to be cheap and this is probably some of the best ice cream I've had, but $3.50 for 2 smallish scoops (not Ben & Jerry's size) wasn't great from a value perspective.

So I'm totally procrastinating with writing b/c for some crazy reason, I decided to go back to school. Turning to yelp is an escape because 1) i don't need a well defined research question, and 2) i don't need to explain the significance of my research. Though I will probably need to work on this if I want funding to buy some ice cream. Bi-Rite Creamery really doesn't need another review, but I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place. Can't get any better than this (well, I do have other fav ice cream shops in the city), but no one has the salted caramel or the roasted banana flavors. Two of my favorite flavors. I can't really give suggestions of when to avoid the line, there's always a line but it's fast. The staff is really good at getting your order and making sure that you have your cup or cone in a hot sec. If it's a nice day, head over to Dolores Park and chill there.

Oh wow.  The salted caramel is amazing.  No joke.  I was only in the bay for a few days, and made a trip out of my way to have it again before I left.  I hate standing in line, I really don't get why people like to, (seriously, I was exiting a garage and 3 cars stood in one line and the other lane was empty) but I would stand in line for the ice cream here.  I hear that there are other places with great ice cream, but I didn't want to take a chance on something when I knew I would be pleased if I went here again.

Bi-Rite Creamery is where the happy people gather. Nice sunny day out on 18th avenue; Once I took a bite into my creamiest salted caramel ice cream my taste bud was dancing. After the intense flavor of coffee toffee, the fresh taste of roasted banana was just so refreshing. So many selections of flavor, you can't help but order two or more scoops at once. Children, mothers, couples, and puppies, we all sit out by the cute little bench. This decadent ice cream is worth the wait.

Mecca, Tibet, Vatican City, Jerusalem, Salt Lake City.... all false religions, to the one true ice creamery.  My fiancee picked it out, and we rode the BART to the 16th street station.  We initially walked in the wrong direction, and getting the distinct impression that we were about to be mugged at any moment, I was thinking that Megan was about to lose her trip planning privileges for taking us to this neighborhood.  We then straightened out where we were and past Valencia the neighborhood turned.  Then the clouds part and a ray of sunshine beamed down upon this humble little shop were scoops of divinity are dispensed to those seeking a momentary, out of body experience. The staff, or maybe ice cream prophet more properly, was excited that it was our first time, and insisted that we tasted almost all of the flavors.  Megan selected two scoops, one of coffee toffee, and another of salted carmel, I decided to follow suit, but then opted to up the ante with a three scoop, 2 of coffee toffee and one of chai with chocolate. We will be making this trek back..... are they still open....damn, I will have to wait until tomorrow. If they were to decide to mass distribute this stuff they could conquer the world, I'm sure of it.

Update:  Balsamic Strawberry (doesn't taste like a salad; balsamic brings out sweet-depth of berries) and Chocolate is my order.  Sometimes, it's the simple things.  There's a line out the door now like Tartine even at 830pm on a cold summer night... yah. FIRST, I REVIEW BI-RITE CREAMERY BROWNIE:  At first, the BRCB seems like there's too much air in the bag... and taste like there's too much air in the brownie because the texture lacks the density and flavour of the DREAM brownie.  Why?  The BRCB was very... uh, American.  (Americaine?)  Yup, Bi-rite cannot dethrone Tartine's creamy, dense, slighlty bitter, jammed with chocolate French femme fantasy brownie.  Oh, no, no BRC, even though I love the neo-Americana-groove you bring to my hood and to your ice cream, your brownie is slightly too pedestrian/non-Euro for my tastes.  (HOWEVER, the next day I noticed that the BRCB tasted better, denser, chocolatey-er... so what's up with that?)  Does is take a day for the BRCB flavours to meld?  Not the best, but worth the $5 for three-pack. Frozen-wise?  Love the malted vanilla, blood orange sorbet, mocha spiced chai and the brown butter pecan; chocolate is decent.  Cannot deal with honey lavender (am I eating soap?), olive oil in my ice cream sundae and again, I'm not a salted caramel convert-- the ice cream or the trend.  Also, cherry almond has issues like almond bits getting caught in the throat causing a mild gagging. Overall, BRC is a cute storefront with lots of tchotchkes and fun stuff to look at while you're waiting in line.  They use real spoons for tasting and while their unique flavours aren't for everyone, weren't we getting tired of bubblegum and spumoni anyway?  Looks just like the ice cream shop I scooped at in the Midwest, and the counterpeople  take care of the 'hood with a smile... just like at Bi-rite down the street.

UPDATE 9/5! I've had a chance to return to Bi-Rite several times now.  I've tried the honey lavendar, milk chocolate chai spice, and the ginger.  All the flavors are good! However!  I am taking away a star because of what seem to be consistency problems.  I've had the salted caramel four times, and it's been different each time.  Sometimes stronger caramel flavor, sometimes weaker.  Sometimes the ice cream is dense, sometimes it has more air incorprated.  It hasn't actually been yucky or anything, but it has been substantially different.   ***Original review*** Okay, so I've only tried the Salted Caramel so far, but it was pure HEAVEN!  Smooth, creamy, rich, with complex flavors that stood up to the texture and sweetness.  Good mouth feel (and I mean that in the dirtiest possible way).  I want to work there.

I completely agree with Max B. on the statement of Andrew G. and the hatred. I mean, DAMN Andrew G., last time I checked, Bi Rite didn't have a Haterade flavor, so you know he didn't get that from them. :D I personally liked this place, and I think that I waited about 5 or 6 minutes in line for my cone, though I think that it was goood because of the fact that there was so many different flavors and I had to weigh my options heavily. The staff was super friendly with my friend and I. The guy that was scooper (can I call him Scooper?) talked with us and was super just mellow and nice. The girl behind the register was sweet and all up-beat. Oh, and for those that are dying to know what I picked...I went with the salted caramel...so good! And, because I'm just "me" like that, I got the salted caramel with caramel sauce on top. Overloaded with goodness in my mouth!!!

I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream! I recently had some of their toasted banana coconut chocolate curry ice cream. It was delicious. The coconut flavor was slightly nuanced and not too strong. The banana flavor was the most pronounced as was the taste of the curry on the finish. The chocolate wasn't in the flavor but instead in little chunks so you were actually biting the chunks and tasting it that way and it made for a more interesting texture. Overall, it was great, it wasn't too sweet or creamy because sometimes ice cream gets cloyingly so and that's why I prefer it when it's cold outside rather than when it's hot. I usually prefer popsicles or Mexican-style shaved ice/sno-cones (raspados) then. It was a toss up between the Balsamic Strawberry and this. I guess I'll have to try that one next time. Also of note was the Honey Lavender ice cream which was delicious. It tasted perfectly like both. I like these fusion flavors because not only are they creative, but, it gets you to think outside the box in terms of flavor pairings. I would expect banana to go with coconut on a tropical theme and I would expect the taste of chocolate thrown in there but the curry was something else. I've also had chocolate with chili powder in it and that goes pretty well together (surprisingly) as is common in some Mexican dishes, like red mole sauce, for example which sometimes has ground peanuts and chocolate added to it richen and smooth out the taste spike of the chilies. All in all, I would say it was the most interesting ice cream I've ever tried other than Garlic ice cream at the Gilroy Garlic Festival a few summers back. That was just weird because essentially it was just vanilla ice cream with garlic flavoring. Weird.

Walking down the frozen food section at a local grocery store, I spied the ice cream section. Scanning left to right, i quickly discovered there was no  bi-rite flavors for me. Oh, yeah, that's right, I'm in CHICAGO not San Francisco. With my shoulders now slumped over, my eyes at the ground and my hands in my pockets, I walked away empty handed. Go to the Creamery, take your dish to the park and enjoy the day, repeat often. The ice cream is that good!

What else can I really say that everyone else hasn't? They have excellent ice cream that works perfectly within the confines of traditional, but without being afraid to make a few small changes to make it truly unforgettable. So many places get lost in the urge to do something new and different that they forget that things often become classic for a reason. Yet just because everyone makes vanilla ice cream doesn't mean you should dismiss it as pedestrian and boring and demand that something be done to offer a new take on it. That's the dark side of food and down that road only lies pretension and flash-in-the-pan noveau cuisine that will be forgotten as soon as the next trend comes along. Well-made food is much like clothing where true classics are often simple not because they're boring, but because they have been refined through the ages. In this respect an excellent vanilla is like a white Oxford-cloth dress shirt: care, quality, and attention to detail all matter and serve to make the simple into the sublime. Salted caramel, malted vanilla, roasted coconut are all stand-outs, but due to the daily changes it pays to come back again and again to sample all that's on offer. Just remember, they're not doing it just to be different or because they believe it's trite and needs to be "updated" (a la "upscale comfort food", "modern American", or almost any sort of fusion), but because they're just trying to do it well. I almost never manage to come to the Mission and not get a cone at Bi-Rite.

I don't get the hype.  It's just ice cream!  I've had better.  I had the snickerdoodle one which was good, but not to die for and the cheesecake one which was NASTY...tasted like lemon yogurt not cheesecake.....maybe it was cheesecake gone bad.   It's a convenient location if you are into Dolores Park....grab a cone and lounge at the park.  It's not really my scene so I will not make an effort to go here again, but also I'm not opposed to going if someone else insists!

This place doesn't really need another review attesting to it's wonderful-ness so I'll keep it short and sweet. There are so many enticing and delicious flavors to choose from (I almost always have a panic attack trying to decide) but I have to say their salted caramel is by far my favorite. For a "single" scoop on a cone, you can get two flavors so it's really more like a double, so it's worth the price. It's worth it to make a trip out to the Mission just for this ice cream. Coupled with a sunny day and Dolores Park, Bi-Rite Creamery is perfection.

Love this ice cream - some of the best I've ever had, if I say so myself. (Lactose intolerance be damned!) It's total Nectar of the Gods - you know, if the Gods were alive today and all. I don't really get the salted caramel hype - I can eat one or two bites before it starts to taste metallicky, which really sucks, because I truly want to like it. Instead, I'll stick with the balsamic strawberry - yummy and not too sweet, the balsamic vinegar tempers it perfectly; the brown butter pecan - so good, with a hint of sweet from the butter; and the chocolate - because, sometimes, I tend to be an ice cream purist and want something familiar and simple.

Creative! Ice Creams flavors: Honey Lavendar, Salted Caramel and Roasted Banana were heavenly...hmmm Great place to stop by after a long day or week...ice cream makes me feel better Well...I brought my run of the mill, Baskin Robbins type of guy friend here and he ordered a banana split. I asked him if he wanted to try the other unique flavors and he said no...so stuck on his routine, reg ways and I couldn't understand that. Anyways, they gave him a banana split...but this was no regular, ihop type of banana split...he looked at it funny and tasted it, tasted some more, licked the spoon and it was all gone. Okay, well he loved it and he wants to come back here next weekend. YaY for Bi-Rite!

Now this is some great ice cream! I'm a Double Scoop (Three Flavors) kind of guy. Salted Caramel is absolutely the best, followed closely by the Strawberry-Balsamic. The Cinnamon with Snickerdoodle is delicious and gets even better if you combine it with a bit of the Ginger ice cream. Really though . . . its the Salted Caramel that brings me back time and time again! Its thoroughly craveable. Mexican Chocolate with Peanuts, Honey Lavender, Creme Fraiche, Brown Butter Pecan, Toasted Coconut, Almond Cherry . . . You are sure to find a flavor that's right for you. The staff is friendly, and graciously offers samples. They have fresh fruit sorbet when in season (plum has been my favorite so far) and walking across the street to Dolores Park (weather permitting) is a perfect way to immerse yourself in both the city and the decadence of Bi-Rite. The Bi-Rite market (across the street and one block down ) also sells some pints and ice cream cookie sandwiches, although I found that the sugar cookies on the Strawberry-Balsamic overwhelmed the ice cream. Stick to the creamery for ice cream, but definitely don't miss the market if you find that you can't live on ice cream alone?!?

Don't even bother reading the other reviews. In fact, don't waste any more of your time considering Bi-Rite as an ice cream option. Is it decent ice cream? Yeah, sure. But seriously, there's only one thing that can be said about this place, and I'm pretty sure it's best expressed through the following haiku: Why would you bother eating ice cream at Bi-Rite when Mitchell's is near?

Perhaps I'm only adding my agreeing voice to over a thousand others, but they're all correct. This is the best ice cream I've ever tasted. We walked in. It was impossible to choose. Each looked better than the next. We tasted, and tasted, and tasted, and tasted, and each tasted better than the next. I'm not sure I've ever paid so much for so little ice cream, and believe me, I would gladly pay twice as much. I'm almost glad I live 40 miles away, otherwise I would blow all of my money eating myself silly on ice cream. It's so good, not only is it worth stopping in, it's worth a special trip for ice cream. No, scratch that, it's worth a freaking intercontinental vacation EVEN IF YOU LIVE IN LIKE SRI FREAKING LANKA to come here for the ice cream.

I'll be fair and judge the place for what it should be judged on, its ice cream. I think it's pretty damn well done. There are no issues of taste here, it's all great and the variety is there, so there's some flavor for all types. My only gripe was that I really don't like the wait too much. Yes, I understand you have to wait for good food, but I'm not even sure this ice cream is worth the tremendous wait you have to endure most times. Then again, you can always skip the line, grab the pint from the fridge, and eat that there. Not scooped right in front of you yes, but tastes just as good.

The best ice cream I have ever had - for serious. When I first tasted Bi-Rite's ice cream, I was amazed. I was dazzled. I never expected that mere humans could take something as tasty as ice cream and make it better. It's like giving David Bowie the power to fly. Bi-Rite is well worth the wait on hot summer days. It is also well worth the mad dash for an $8 pint in a rainstorm. The friendly staff lets you try as much ice cream as you want, and you will want to with all the flavors they have up for grabs. The only bad thing I can say about Bi-Rite Creamery is that one time I waited in a crazy long line to get ice cream, and then when I got outside I took a lick of the top scoop of my cone and knocked it to the ground. While my friends and I pondered whether or not the five-minute-rule applies to ice cream, the frosty dome turned into a sugary, gravelly soup. So sad. My favorites to date include balsamic strawberry, salted caramel and creme fraiche.

The best ice cream shop in SF.  It's creamy and its made with organic ingredients.  The service is super fast, if only people in front of you doesnt sample a ton of flavors  I ordered a ice cream cake for my brother's bday last year and it was DELICIOUS.  Price is decent too.  It's way better than any other ice cream places that makes ice cream cakes.  On a hot sunny day, I would definitely come here and grab my sweet, then head to delores park ( all the way to the top by the bus stop ) sit there and enjoy the sun and the view of the city. By the way the ice cream lingo is a bit weird.  Kids scoop, u get 1 flavor, Single scoop, u get 2 scoops of your choice, Double scoop u get 3 scoops of your choice.  I thought single mean 1 and double means 2? Whatever, Kids scoop is fine with me.

Walked in here today after the Walk Against Rape. I was hungry and needed something cold. This place hit the spot. My sis and I shared the Brownie Sundae $6.50 plus tax. Delicious!!! It was just the right amount for the both of us. The brownies were fresh and the whipped cream was delicious. To my behold there was no wait!! No wait on a Saturday afternoon?? Yes, we used it to our advantage. Staff was friendly and nice. He figured my sis and I were sharing and gave me an extra spoon without me having to ask. Def would come again. Buuut I'm not the waiting in line kind of person so only with no line I would.

Normally, when there's something in the Mission, I'm on it. But when Bi-Rite opened, I was busy and my butt was bigger than usual. Plus, living at 26th St biases me to the south Mission and Mitchell's. How can you get better than buko flavored ice cream? Mexican chocolate? Then I traveled around the world for a year and when people I met heard I was from San Francisco, the first thing that many of them asked was "Oh, isn't that where that ice cream place is that has the salt caramel flavor. Like, oh my god. You're so lucky to live there." Just two days after landing back in San Francisco, I had my first saltysweet taste of Bi-Rite's caramel flavor. It was a little melted from under freezing, but since I gobbled it down, that wasn't much of a problem. Other flavors like balsamic strawberry and honey lavender were worth returning for too. Though the salt caramel may always beat them back when I order.

On the hottest day of this summer, we were in the Castro watching the parade and the perfect way to beat the heat was to have some ice cream! It just happened that we saw this little cute place across the street. I'm soooo happy we decided to wait in line and get yummy ice cream! I'm a pretty big ice cream eater and this is definitely hands down the best ice cream I've ever had. I had the honey lavendar and the black cherry almond. The flavors was so intense and the ice cream was super moist and flavorful. I loved every bite of it and I wanted more after I was done with my one scoop! I'll definitely come back here again and eat it again. Hopefully it'll be some time soon! :)

Wowaweewa. I was sitting at home watching the food network and someone said that the Sam's Sundae was to die for here. And thus began our journey to get in line and get us some of that delish ice cream!! We drove by here around 8 and the line was long, so we decided to do some shopping at the early sale at Nordies and return some stuff at Urban and decided to return. Line was still long, BUT we got parking right smack in the front so it wasn't bad at all. Waiting in line isn't that bad, especially not bad for this kind of ice cream. =) MMM.... I ended up getting the Sam's Sundae which is two scoops of chocolate ice cream, with olive oil, sea salt, and whip cream. SO GROOD. My BF got the malted vanilla and balsamic strawberry. The strawberry is to die for! So good! =) We got a pint to go. They also have a punch card! Go. Here. Now.

Bon Appetit named Bi-Rite Creamery and Bakeshop as one of the top 10 ice cream shops in the U.S.A. So, naturally, I had to go and check it out. The ice cream was fresh and cheap, but I think they could improve their flavor palette. Plus, I was surprised that they didn't offer toppings Cold Stone style. I still think Cold Stone has better ice cream, but out of support for local ma-n-pa places, I highly recommend Bi-Rite Creamery to those who live in or will visit San Francisco.

Sam's Sundae was not as delicious as it appeared to be.  The description of this sundae sounded amazing! And friends had referred this to me... but the olive oil and salt just didn't seem proportionally correct to make this sundae really stand out. My dessert companions, however, both chose amazing flavored ice cream!  Toffee something and the lavender ice cream.  I would make another trip back but would definitely NOT choose the sam's sundae.

Wait, what? No review from me yet? I LOVE BI-RITE. Yes it's a small shop, yes parking sucks (but where in SF doesn't it),  yes seating is limited but the ice cream! Oh, the ice cream! Salted caramel is my ultimate favorite. It's not easy to perfect the balance between salty and sweet and Bi-rite does it right. At other places it's either too salty or too sweet. Next in line is lavender honey and then brown sugar. SO FREAKING GOOD. So smooth and so creamy. I also love that they use all local and organic ingredients. I wish there was a Bi-Rite closer to home.

Tried this on our trip up to San Francisco, I'm sure for some people, mostly those who inhabit the city, this place is worthwhile and it would be for me if I lived anywhere near here, but I don't. The ice cream seemed ordinary and it was just ok, nothing too great. I will confess I'm not a big ice cream person so that already was a bias for me BUT I must say that the taste of Salted Caramel was pretty unique as was my friends Toasted Coconut. Maybe I needed to try something else, or maybe I need to try all the flavors, but I would never ever ever ever say I NEED to visit this place on my trips to SF... but you should try just to give it a chance your opinion really is the one that matters at the end of the day.

POMEGRANATE POPSICLE STICKS. I'm a sorbet gurf, not really into the creamy ice cream. but I did enjoy their salted caramel and their roasted coconut that my mum had. I'm not a coconut fan but this kicks the spot. I hate waiting in long lines cause it's always a line ride here I've never been pass this spot without having to hang out and ride the line ride. But once you get in it's nice and cool on a warm summers day with refreshing ice cream to go with. They have gift cards which is an extreme plus, cause I know gift cards it makes me feel like I'm not spending any money at all! D: but I hate when it's a driving adventure, because then at times we get parking tickets because the police is always giving by.

You first come here and see the flavors options.  Vinegar strawberry, honey lavender, chai spiced tea chocolate.  You'd think they just randomly toss in stuff into their test kitchen and went let's try this and that, but hey, it worked! Only issue for me is getting here, it's away from the freeway and clustered in the horrible area where it's extremely hard to park and the wait is somewhat long.     Also my fav Food Star Network loves this place, and you can probably see AIda there a lot.

So I was finally able to try this place out to see what the fuss is.  I love trying out things that are original and the flavors are original!  You should at least order the double size that allows 2-3 flavors.  The single size just doesn't cut it for me. SALTED CARAMEL, EARL GREY, and the Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces flavors were AMAZING with every spoonful.  I wasn't too crazy about the balsamic strawberry since it tasted like any other strawberry ice cream.  If you only like lavendar in your soaps and lotions, I wouldn't try the honey lavendar ice cream.  I just couldn't get passed the taste like I was eating soap. It's worth waiting in line for and check out the Bi-Rite store across the street for some interesting goodies.

I just tried Bi-Rite today as a part of my SF food tour.  Wow. I got the Banana Split  I got it with a scoop each of Lavender Honey and Salted Caramel.  Amazing combination already, but to top it off, they caramelize your banana with a blow torch and add hot fudge, fresh whipped cream and nuts...heavenly. I also tried the Sam's Sundae with chocolate ice cream, bergamot olive Olive oil and sea salt and whipped cream.  It was interesting and amazingly good, but very rich,  I can't say I could do a whole sundae, but ask for a sample to just to experience it.  I also sampled the balsamic strawberry, which was very good with a balanced flavor. Their baked goods looked pretty amazing, but I had to hold back.  Well, for today, anyway.  I'm only in the city for another couple of days, but I'm seriously contemplating going back to Bi-Rite before I leave.

Bottom line: Sam's Sundae is, without a doubt, the best ice cream dessert treat I've ever had. Yeah, I'll admit it: I saw the damn  thing on that thar food network show, "The Best Thing I Ever Ate", saw the 2000+ yelp reviews with a legitimate 4 1/2 stars rating and had to go. I went on a Saturday afternoon and not surprisingly,  there was a line. I usually hate lines but the reputation of this place preceded it so we stayed put. For a place that does so much business, the girls behind the counter are really quite cordial. Service with a smile, even when treating people like cattle wouldn't deter too many customers away. It took a little longer to get my sundae as opposed to my 2 other companions getting their single scoops of ice cream because, as the girl said with a smile,"We're making you a fresh one because the whip cream wasn't good enough". Sounds like a weird, brown-nosed fantasy but they want their product to go out with a high standard of quality. Oh yeah, if you dont already know, Sam's Sundae is 2 scoops of luscious chocolate ice cream that is made with good, high quality chocolate producing a true chocolate flavor, drizzled with bergamot olive oil (which was a citrusy, lavender taste) sprinkled with maldon' sea salt and lastly, freshly whipped, whipped cream. Now, as you can tell, Im no professional food writer and i dont know how it works, but it works. The olive oil has so much flavor and it adds this floral, lavender taste to the sundae, its completely new to me and completely amazing. The salt adds this savory accent that cuts through the decadent creaminess of the ice cream... Yes, Im babbling and im sure i embarrassed myself when I was waxing poetic about the sundae as i ate it on the sidewalk, my companions rolling their eyes at me but I dont care, this thing is great. Definitely not your normal had fudge on vanilla with a cherry on top...If you're wondering how such a sundae could be thi good and this popular, just get over to bi-rite creamery and try it.

The ice cream here is ridiculously good. The salted caramel lived up to all of the reviews that I read prior to sitting down for a cone with my friend. Miraculously, we didn't have to wait in line. The ice cream gods must have been smiling on us at the time because when we left the line was way out the door. I also tried a sweet cream with soem kind of brittle in it, which was also incredibly awesome. Go to Bi-Rite if you want delicious ice cream that hasn't been over hyped. You won't be sorry!

Finally had a chance to try Bi-Rite. My nephews rave about this place so I was really looking forward to trying it. Parking is almost non-existent here. After about 15-20 minutes of looking we lucked out when someone left right in front of the creamery. By this time there was only a handful of people in line so we didn't have to wait too long. Decided to try the balsamic strawberry (definitely better than the balsamic caramel i tried at the other creamery) with mint chip and coffee crunch or something like that. The ice cream is very rich and creamy and very filling. The flavors don't seem to be as adventurous as Slocombe's but the flavors they do have they make it good. Will definitely visit here again.

It can't be any better than this! This is absolutely THE BEST ice cream I have ever tried!  It's light and airy, yet creamy and oh so yummy! My fave is brown butter pecan :o)  They have other flavors which I have yet to try....I might try the salted caramel next.... Anyway, I can't wait until friends from out of town come to visit so I can share the delishiousness of Bi-Rite Ice Cream... There is a line if you want to try samples and get a cone - otherwise, head over to the Bi-Rite market across the street and get a pint. On the scale of ice cream prices...this one is on the higher end, but its a wonderful treat every once in awhile and its all good ingredients. If you visit SF you have to check out the ice cream!

I typically compare all ice creams to Ici's in Berkeley. I love those crazy flavors that somehow work out so beautifully! In short, Bi-Rite was for sure on par with Ici - I loved it! I got the Pumpkin and Honey Lavender. I love that Bi-Rite's ice cream is not too overpoweringly sweet. The pumpkin had more of a taste of pumpkin spice/cinnamon, which is a good thing in my books, though it's not represented in the name. The Honey Lavender was also fantastic - a dominant honey taste with a hint of lavender. Loved it, and would recommend it to everyone! :)

Alrighty! I came here on my ice cream tour of California. Came here when there was no line! (3 o'clock??) Yay! Well there was a little line but about five minutes. The girl at the counter was very sweet. I got the salted caramel. The name just got me. It was unlike anything I had ever tasted. I can't believe no one has said that it tastes BURNT. Well maybe they have but I didn't go back far enough in all of the reviews I read. It was so good, but had a strong burnt flavor. I'm totally coming back here.

On hot days you'll see the line from Bi-Rite reach the street corner of 16th & Dolores and beyond that. That may be the only terrible thing, not really worthy of losing a star in my opinion as we are judging the quality of the good stuff--yada dafdsakjf The best thing about this place is the ice cream tastes exactly how you imagine their quirky names to taste. Does that make sense? I probably sound like Willy Wonka, more specifically, when he was describing "the raspberries tasting like raspberries the snozzberries tasting like snozzberies" (I'll go on a tangent every so often). +The honey lavender tastes like a flower made of milk and honey, if that makes any sense but I guarantee you'll love it, unless you're a man with a taste for something less sweet. +The toasted coconut had shreds of toasted coconut in it and tasted like a real coconut cupcake on a cone +The salted caramel won't disappoint if you're a Twix, Reeses', Snickers kind of babe ;) The portions are so small and you feel like a fat ass for ordering 4 even though 4 scoops of their ice cream totals about one normal ice cream scoop by my standards. This doesn't really apply to the sundae, the sundaes were kind of big, satisfying. Works best if you have 2 flavors you love that go well together because you get a way bigger portion, toppings, choice flavored syrup and a symphony of sweet and salty, a rare achievement, period. lol Good luck finding parking Only go there for the ice cream! Their cookies tastes terrible =\

LOOOONG lines. Since we weren't from the area, time was limited. The long line is for all the options, whereas the shorter line was for selected soft serve flavors and other treats. We opted for the shorter line. Luckily they had the flavor I wanted to try which was the salted caramel, because of all the reviews. It was delicious. Just the right creaminess, salty/sweet mix to be satisfying but not overdone. The shorter line only took a couple minutes and we went on our way back to the hotel. At least I was able to check this place off my list of places I wanted to go while in SF. Definitely, next time I'm in town I'll be a trooper, go in the other line so I can take advantage and try the other flavors. =)

Every time I have gone has been at 930pm-ish and there is always a long line wrapping around the corner building. We've stood in the cold in parkas and holding places in line while friends find parking. ... so worth it. Faves: Vegan chocolate, balsamic strawberry, lavendar (smells so good!), and salted caramel. GO!

Great ice cream but the place is almost too popular.  I usually go with the salted caramel (#35 on the 2012 SF Big Eat in 7x7 Magazine) but there are dozens of delicious and exotic flavors - worth the cash as long as the line is under 20 people.

Roasted Banana is my everything. Not joking. It's the only ice cream I will go out of my way to get. I always want to get that + one new flavor every time I go to Bi-Rite, but then I find that Balsamic Strawberry and Salted Caramel are just so delicious too that I end up forcing my friends to get the other flavors I want to try and just mooching off of them. Honey Lavender is also delicious, but I'm not much of a fan of such... fragrant-tasting things, I guess you'd call it (I mean I don't like Jasmine tea either so if that kind of thing floats your boat then go for it!). Always get at least two flavors. I don't remember if they've always had so many tables inside but I like it! It's also conveniently located next to Dolores Park so just go over there and eat your ice cream and enjoy the nice San Francisco sun while it lasts! As for me, I'm pretty sure I'm going to be there every single week this summer. Hopefully I'll be able to resist getting my usual roasted banana + salted caramel combo and try some more of their other flavors... See you there! :)

i'm really not into the standing in line thing. just ask tartine around the corner from bi-rite. so i don't end up eating at this place every time i am tempted to. but when the line is short enough for my patience, it is quite a treat. original and fun flavors that don't just look interesting on the chalkboard - they actually taste good, too. and over on the soft serve side of things they have baked goods. that window never has the wait the main entrance has.

Really really good! There is also a park across the street where you can sit and enjoy the weather. Suggestion: Salted caramel If you love it, you can just head in and buy the prepackaged ones and take it home...the only problem with that is you might just eat it all in one sitting and feel it in your thighs later.

I've only tried the salted caramel but it was sooooo good that I don't know if I could ever get myself to NOT get it. Do yourself a favor and get in line for this salty/sweet goodness that is the Salted Caramel flavor at Bi-Rite. The lines get crazy long during summer that they need a bouncer to handle things. Yes you read it correctly, a bouncer for Club Bi-Rite. If you want to avoid the lines, I'll let you in on a little secret. Just walk in, go to the freezer and pick up a pint of the flavor you want. Get your bootay over to Dolores Park and eat your heart out. You're welcome.

ehhh, the ice cream is ok, I don't get why everyone is so in love with this place.  And it definitely isn't worth waiting in line.  If this place didn't have Dolores Park across the way I doubt this place would become the legend it has become.  If you really want to get ice cream and are with a group you don't mind sharing cooties with, skip the line and grab a pint.

Bi-Rite is my absolute favorite, even on a rainy day! Basically, long story short, great vibe, great people, and better yet, AMAZING ice cream. Some of my favorite flavors are Ricanelas, Earl Grey, and the Chocolate Coconut. The Rose flavor really does taste like flowers, it's so great!!

Yum... On a hot hot day, nothing beats bi-rite ice cream. I went for the requisite salted caramel and toasted banana and topped it all off with hot fudge and the almond toffee (quadruple yum)... I know much has been said about the salted caramel and the toasted banana but let me put in my 2 cents about the almond toffee: You HAVE to get it. I see so many of you walk away with a scoop of one thing or another and I think about how incomplete your lives must be if you haven't tried this topping. It is like the yin to your yang (the crunch to the soft creaminess of the ice cream.) Take it from me: Brave the line (again) and order the make your own sundae and top it off with the almond toffee.

They have so many unique and different flavors! My favorites are Riccanelas and Toasted Coconut! Yumm! Seating is limited, but you can eat outside of the creamery or at Dolores Park (right across the street!! Parking sucks - BIG TIME! The line can get really long... especially on hot days but you can buy pints of ice cream at the little window outside of the creamery. Tip: Honey Lavender tastes like soap!! But that's just my opinion.

Salted caramel, hands down best flavor. It tasted like fresh, homemade, buttery caramel that has melted in your mouth. I would pay to have quarts shipped to my house (since I live on the east coast). I'm so glad I have friends who know good food.

Went to try the recommended Salted Caramel and was not impressed. Simply felt like eating caramel from a snickers bar. :\ Not sure what all the rave was about. I tried 3 flavors, SC, Honey Lavender, and Orange ???(forgot). The Orange-whatever was blek. Tasted ginger-y and failed my is-a-dessert-test. Weird blend of flavors there. Next! The stand out for me was Honey Lavender since the flavors really showed. The honey stood out and had a natural sweet taste which is awesome. Might go back there to test other flavors but not sure if it is worth the wait.

The ice cream is really good, dont get me wrong, but I want to go back and try more flavors before I give it its extra stars. I tried the Sam's Sundae, since it's been raved and talked about a lot. Chocolate ice cream, bergamot olive oil, and rock sea salt.  The olive oil is what through me off and intrigued me, so i had to try it.  it was good.  I definitely had to acquire a taste for the bergamot olive oil, but I loved the chocolate and the salt. I will defintely come back to try the salted caramel, strawberry balsamic, and the ricanella! Also, dont get confused between the market and the creamery.  Imagine our confused face when our google maps led to a very packed grocery lol.  the creamery is further down the street.

You know something's good when there's always a line out the door. It is a small establishment, but still, for ice cream in a city that averages 50-60 degree temps and ridiculously hard to find parking, it's a testament to how good ice cream is even in cold weather. I love the variety of flavors at Bi-Rite. Simple and common with a dash of creativity. It's a place that knows their flavors which translates well to the masses. My favorite flavor is the Earl Grey Tea which is pretty much milk tea in ice cream form (but without the pearls). Unfortunately, they don't always have it. The coffee toffee is amazing and so is the browned butter pecan. I could go on and on because all of them are just so uniquely bi-rite. The great thing about the location is that you can get your ice cream and (on a good day if you're lucky) walk across the street to Dolores Park and savor your ice cream on the green grass. At that moment, you'll be enjoying how perfect everything is. It's worth the trek from the south bay and don't forget to get a "Buy 10 get 1 free card". note: not 5 stars because - it's far from me, parking really is annoying, and they haven't opened one in the south bay. (hint, hint)

I am a fan! I finally tried their ice cream...I know I am just a few years late haha. I ordered the Green tea and cherry chocolate in a cup. I am not a big fan of eating ice cream on a cone because I am a big klutz :p The cherry chocolate is my favorite because it has chunks of brownie and chocolate in it...plus cherry pieces :D There was a long line but the line moved fast!

This review should really be 3.5 I was so hyped up to try Bi-Rite after reading pages of reviews and hearing about it from everyone I know whose tried it. Sadly, it didnt not meet my expectations at all. I sampled a handful of the flavors and none of them really had that "wow factor"..I didnt even bother sampling the salted caramel cuz I just wanted to get it, thinking that it was the most popular flavor. Regretted my choice immediately of not trying it first, before thinking that I would like it. I just felt was was a bit too sweet, it was good but not great. I think the best one there was the earl grey ice-cream. I also wished that they had more unique flavors to choose from. It was nice to try, but really nothing worth coming back for.

How can you say no to ice cream. This is my new relief joint after being tortured by my chiropractor (which happens twice a week), so this means that I will be having ice cream to sooth my pain with ice cream twice a week. Fair trade. Parking is very limited and there are only five small tables inside. But they do have a restroom. There is seating outside. There are long lines, when I went, but it moves very fast. For those who Yelp via AT&T iPhone, there is no reception. Nada...So it may be hard to "Check-In" there.   So far I have tried three types there. The salted caramel, brown sugar, and the malted vanilla. The salted caramel tasted more like peanut brittle but with a little bit of a salty pinch to it. Very good and a must have. Next one I had was the malted vanilla. This one had peanut butter bits through out the dish. This one was oh so good too.   Last was the brown sugar. I really liked this one. I totally forgot what was in it. I guess my senses were blown away by the yummy goodness in my tummy...or it could have been the brain freeze after eating it so fast. As they say back in Hawaii...Onolicious!!!

The ice cream here is definitely good, but I'm still undecided if it's worth the parking hassle and waiting in line. It's the kind that you can eat all day and not get sick of, which is rare. I got honey lavender & salted caramel and would come back to buy those in takeout containers in a heartbeat. I'm sure none of their flavors would disappoint.

I am no longer the last Bi-Rite virgin.  Hubby and I FINALLY went last night.   Let me tell you: the time stood still, there was a moment of world peace and I think an angel got his wings the minute I tried the salted caramel ice cream. I've been eyeballing their menu for the looooongest time.  We were having dinner in Bernal Heights for our anniversary so we decided to head over to BRC for a little celebratory dessert.  It was 8:45p when we arrived, and as I would hope: Line out the door.  I love that. We were so excited to be there, that we didn't really do anything but anticipate the salted caramel ice cream so we didn't sample others and check out much of their other stuff.  However, I was able to sneak a quick bite of the cinnamon + snickerdoodle from the cutie working the cash register (thanks guy!) and it was quite tasty. Yup.  We'll be back...and we're bringing friends.

The best ice cream in San Francisco. The staff is helpful and friendly. The samples are generous. The sample of the hot cholocate was very good. Also the cookies are some of the best in SF and only 75 cents each. Only four stars because like any ice cream shop there are good flavors and flavors that are only ok. The ginger ice cream is five star all the way. There is a nice blood orange flavor too. I thought the salted carmel was ok but I didn't love it like the ginger which is worth a trip.

If Ice Cream was a country and every flavor from every ice cream place was a person living in that country, Salted Caramel from Bi-Rite would be that country's Supreme Dictator and Living God. Other ice creams would walk for days, shoeless, over dirt roads and through snowy mountain passes just to spend a fleeting moment in his presence. He would be the world's most powerful dessert, beloved by his subjects and allies, hated and feared by his enemies. He would make the leaders of Cake, Cookies, Pie and Chocolate bend to his irresistable will. He would travel in a diamond-encrusted helicopter.

5 stars for bi-rite creamery! :) the reviews here don't do this place justice. the ice cream they offer is not only refreshing, delicious, but the flavors are incredible. you won't find these flavors anywhere else, or as good and home-made tasting. sample flavors: creme fraiche - tastes like frozen cream cheese YUMMMM cinnamon - leaves you with sweet cinnamon breath lemon- MY FAVORITE, never fails strawberry balsamic soy chocolate browned butter pecan honey & lavendar salted caramel - another favorite of mine, and from the sound of it, everyone else's too mint chip i have yet to try them all. they also have scandalous-looking ice cream cakes and pies too. expect to pay big bucks for those. oh, btw, i live right next to this place! don't hate. *p.s.: pumpkin butt once tried this interesting sundae where they poured some bergamot oil drenched over chocolate ice cream and whipped cream. sound weird? yeah, tasted weird too.

I've never been here, so sorry that I'm rating it. I just want to say that the line is too long to go here! Between the lines here and at  Mitchell's, you'll find proof that San Franciscans are starved for dairy. Down with this town's vegan tyranny! This town needs more ice cream parlors--supporting happy, hormone- and antibiotic-free cows, of course. P.S. Someone just wrote me asking why I rated this business if I've never been there. I think it's fine for me or anybody else to point out that the line has been too long to go here. See what Jenny K. says, for instance. If Yelp let me leave no rating, I'd do that. Meow, hiss.  ;)

The first time I visited Bi-rite Creamery, I wasn't impressed.  The ice cream had an annoying icy quality, and the flavors tasted like the base was made with evaporated milk. Months later, I've gone back and it is among one of the best ice cream shops in the city.  A little sliver of a place located in the Delfina corridor in the Mission, it's cute and simple crammed with an array of sweet treats, ranging from chocolate sauces and confections from local boy Michael Recchutti, to various cookbooks, notecards and company t-shirts made from organic cotton. The ice cream, rich, creamy and flavorful.  The Roasted banana is made from fresh bananas roasted with brown sugar, the honey lavender is light and fragrant with hints of bergamont.  The salted caramel, the signature flavor is a combination that could have gone south with a quickness, but the balance of burnt caramel edged with salt (which I presume is sea salt) makes this quite possibly one of the best ice cream flavors ever created. The service is good, although the servicers could smile a bit more.  They do believe in sampling, which always a good thing.  All in all, Bi-Rite is one more excellent ice cream shop for us foodie types to indulge ourselves.  Hopefully more people will support these boutique-type businesses; anything to help run the chain operations the hell out of town!

I love ice cream. I'm lactose intolerant. However, since I looove ice cream, I defy my intolerance regularly and suffer many consequences and usually it's worth it. And the first time I tried the ice cream here, it was worth it, though a little soft.  But the next time it was even softer, and the third time I was annoyed. Licking as quickly as possible, I still couldn't eat it fast enough to avoid the melting mess my dessert was becoming. I've bought pints, cones, and cups but now I'm giving up. I can't keep up. My ice cream must have more substance- I would like to chew it softly, please.

Mark G.'s War Journal: 7/25/07 I'm starting to smell a conspiracy going on in the Mission. First, I discovered Mitchell's when I moved here a few years back. Then, it was the Bombay Ice Creamery. Now, Bi-Rite seems to have joined the dark side by opening their own ice cream shop. Who could be behind this? It's possibly someone close. Someone who knows that I have a sweet tooth. Someone who knows I shouldn't be eating these sort of things. Someone who knows that I cannot fight temptation when it comes to ice cream. And, the Bi-Rite Creamery knows how to make their ice-cream. Damn them. Who could be behind this? Professor Celsius? Doctor Kelvin? The Iced Wonder? Or perhaps it is that nefarious Frederick von Fahrenheit? I must investigate. I should start at the docks. Perhaps its seedy denizens could shed some light on the evil mastermind. But, first, I must stop by Bi-Rite Creamery for a little dessert.

I had heard alot about this place, supposedly comparable to Mitchells. The ice cream was good... not overbearingly sweet and good consistency. There were probably about 15 different varieties to choose from (1/2 of them classics, the other 1/2 more unique) In the end, I got the butternut pecan which is odd because I love to try different flavors. None of those options appealed to me that night (Lavendar...?) Long lines, but it moves fast & the service is friendly and quick. This is ice-cream afterall. I might be more adventurous next time & maybe it'll convince me to up my rating. My companions DID rave about the sugar cones - so i'll be sure to check that out as well.

I'm sorry Mitchell's, but you really let me down when you stopped carrying Chicago Cheesecake ice cream. Yes, Bi-Rite is closer to where I live and carries lemon ice cream (Mitchell's doesn't). There are no numbers to take from the number machine so you just have to hop in line here and wait your turn. There are still long lines to wait in here at any hour of the day. Maybe more so during the day at Bi-Rite since it is so close to Dolores Park. One other downfall of Bi-Rite-your only parking options are street parking. Mitchell's has limited parking in the back. Don't let the line or parking discourage you. The ice cream alone is well worth the effort. The staff is always really friendly too. Not sure which flavor to try? Ask for a sample. There can NEVER be enough ice cream options in the city. Bi-Rite is an excellent option!!

This place makes ice cream the way it should be made... The flavors are eclectic, yet tasteful and playful all at the same time. Like baking, the process of creating ice cream is all about the magic that happens once you put the ingredients together... Every time I walk by this joint it is always hop-hop-in. Before I even knew the pleasures of this great little oasis. My girlfriend kept hinting to me that we 'need' to go here. We should go to the creamery... Hey it is sort of luke-warm out, we should go check out the creamery... It sure is cold and windy..maybe we could go down to that little place by the park and get some ice cream...oh yeah the BI-RITE CREAMERY!!!!!!!!! FINALLY, I pulled my head out of my leftover southern California mental-haze... AND... we checked out the creamery a week or so go after hanging at the park. It could not have been a more perfect day to roll the flavor dice at the creamery... Man!?   Holy COW...Sacred walking lactose filled savings account and future retirement fund.......If I had only known how may cool flavors they had to choose from......all the time I have wasted.....I could have been full force into sampling everything that comes out of this sweet joint!? Luckily for you and the salvation and sustainability of this entire planet..... This little joint, is by no means a f-in 31 flavors....AND dismount! (as if I could be riding a horse while I typed this little bugger of a review!? Hehehehe forward march men...on to the creamery...we can climb and seize the castle by night fall, one for all and all for one!)

San Fran is not a dessert-kinda-town. This is especially true when it comes to ice cream. You can do Mitchell's, which when compared to the  option of Baskin Robbins, Swensen's or Polly Ann's, is relatively fair. One can, if willing, make the trek 'across the bridge and through the hood' to Fenton's for more decent creamage. On the other hand, whom strives for just the OK? Why not partake of the really good? Try Bi-Rite Creamer and baked goodies. Each flavor tastes completely different. That's why they are called different flavors. A basic concept, often lost on the aforementioned ice cream purveyors. The Salted Caramel...a creamy concoction of fresh caramel with a hint of salt. The coffee...has "coffee' in it. The vanilla, with real vanilla bean. Get the picture? Go now.

3 stars to the girl who let me use the bathroom even though the sign on the door said: employees only. 1 star to the pumpkin flavored ice cream. We got two scoops of it with stale-tasting gingerbread. I don't know what all the hype is about. It really wasn't that spectacular. I'll have to visit again and try the other flavors. Hopefully it won't be another disappointment.

I used to be a loyal customer to Maggie Mudds--- but Bi-Rite won me over! One, it's in a super convient location, just a half block away from Dolores Park- nothing more fun (in the summer at least) to get ice cream and hang out in the park with friends. Bi-Rite Creamery makes all their ice cream in small batches using local and organic ingredients. It is obvious how much care and thought the staff puts into their product-- with a variety of unique flavors such as salted caramel, honey lavander and Basalmic Strawberry flavor- but they also have traditional favorites like Cookies and Cream and Chocolate too. The flavors rotate, but they are pretty consistent too. High quality ingredients with craftsmaker care! They also have a nice selection of pre-made cookies and cakes and pint sized ice creams to go- which works out really nice if you want to bring something sweet to a dinner party. The astethic of the place is nice too- simple, and small they have a few benches outside for sitting, as well as a couple of bar stools inside for eating too. The ice cream display is simple and they sample with metal spoons- which I really enjoy. Oh, and their to go containers (paper cups and wooden spoons) are 100% compostable!

The ice cream is good.  Really good.  Wonderful flavors.  Unique flavors.  Intense flavors.  700+ reviews to tell you that already. Oh, but the line.  Why so long?  Why so full of annoying hipsters? Sometimes when I see that line, I think to myself, sure roasted banana is sublime, but there's no line at that ice cream cart being pushed around Dolores Park. Why don't I just go there and get some instant, albeit lackluster and chemically, gratification?

Hands down best ice cream in the city.   Better than Mitchell's, better than Swenson's.  (I still love both of them and won't stop going to them.) I had the malted vanilla with peanut brittle.  When I ordered it I actually thought the written menu said peanut BUTTER... my favorite thing and I ordered it.  It turned out to be peanut brittle and it was still really yummy.  I also had the regular chocolate which was to die for.  And I'm not that huge of a chocolate fan. My friend had the coffee one and the banana one.  Both sooo amazing.  I'll be hitting it up every time I'm in the area... just like everyone else.  Beware of lines...but they're totally worth it.

Walking back from the yarn store ... my endless obsession ... there is nothing better than a scoop of chocolate ice cream on a hot day. I pretty much always order chocolate, although perhaps I should have been more adventurous, as Bi-Rite has some pretty fantasical-looking flavors! Salted peanut indeed! Anyway, being a stickler for chocolate allows me to compare this standard of ice cream flavors, and I must say that the Bi-Rite chocolate stands up well to the other varieties around the city. It's nice and dark, with a wonderful, legitimate graininess. It doesn't taste over processed, and on a day like this, it simply melt ... in your mouth, and if you're on careful, on your clothes. The cones are also quite excellent. Crisp and thin, but substantial enough to hold their own and be refreshing against the richness of the ice cream. And I didn't try this, but you can get multiple flavors on a  single cone! It's the closest idea I've seen to gelato since, well, gelato! Except it's most definitely ice cream and doesn't pretend to be anything but that. Definitely head here. Lines go quickly and the reward is as tasty as they come.

Okay, so still think the flavor and quality of the ice cream is still dyn-o-mite! But, the portions are getting tres wimpy. We noticed this a few visits back, but recently it has gotten out of control! We decided to go with the double scoop (2-3 flavors), but sadly, the scoop sizes of 2 scoops does not even compare to the 1 scoop of the good old days. My 3 scoops today did not even fill the bowl. Just 3 sad little golf balls hanging out in a vast bio-degradable bagasse bowl.  For almost $5 for 3 scoops, just feel a bit short changed. I do think it depends on who is scooping, but come on, the big yummy scoops (versus the corporate mandated scoops) were part of the charm. But, alas, it seems to have changed.

My favorites are Roasted Banana and Toasted Coconut, but honestly all of them are unique and taste so good. The people behind the counters are always pleasant and give you tastings by the spoonful.

I knew I liked their ice cream last time, and yup, I liked it even more this time. This is how Salted Caramel should be made (I wish Molly Moon's could learn from Bi-Rite.....salted caramel doesn't have to be salt ice cream). I also had a scoop of Coconut ice cream, and wow was it good! The service is efficient and friendly. Amount of ice cream is just right.

So one day I perused the Mission on my bike, it was hot, it was summer, it was ice cream time. I looked to the right side of 18th street, right by Dolores Park. Holy smokes! There was about 50 people waiting in line for Bi-Rite. I figure that's got to be the shiznit ice cream right there. I came back another night more recently to avail of no lines, and hit up three scoops of ice cream. The salted caramel that's really popular.. was really good, salty, sweet, creamy, buttery, velvety, smooth.. It was pretty tasty, the chocolate and the cookies and cream were really good too. It's not really pricey either, so for a pit stop at the Dolores Park.. I think Bi-Rite is a great place. Everyone loves ice cream, and if you don't then you're a sadistic person who probably hates animals. Nuff said' - go try it. Buy a pint and if you've recently broken up with someone, this place will mend your heart a little and make you loosen up your belt a little too.

Um, maybe my experience here was in some way different from other people's but I kind of thought it was, well, ice cream. They did have some kind of weird flavors, which was interesting, and I understand they make it themselves, which is pretty awesome, but I have to say I wouldn't stand in line for an hour for this in the hot sun. I like Swenson's better. Oh! But they did have a super awesome cookie of the day/ It was like, lemon... shortbread, kind of. And only 75 cents!  And the guys who were working were really really cool.

I don't like Honey Lavender- tastes like a spa that I would go to and that would be lathered with a lotion with that scent/taste. And I love chai lattes.. but the Chai Spiced Milk Chocolate was just okay for me... not to bag on the company but I do love the Malted Vanilla, Salted Caramel, and Strawberry Balsamic flavors... recently I tried one that was (Ginger, Caramel, Vanilla, Brown Sugar?) That was amazing.... :) all in all, I would recommend this place if you're looking for unique flavors and a lovely staff. Very Friendly!

Salted caramel = amazing. Coffee toffee = equally amazing. The servers behind the counter are super nice and funny, and always let you sample.

Will travel (and wait in line...), and walk long distances for ice cream, especially if it is Bi-rite.  I was hoping for salt and pepper ice-cream or olive oil ice cream, something ingenious, exotic, or quixotical.  I had to settle for less.  But less was still great. Pomegranate sorbet and Honey- Lavender Ice cream.  Creamy perfume glaciers melting and coating my tongue in fresh velvet.  Yes, that's what I get. Superbe!  I also tasted the salted caramel.  Rich and homespun, an odd and rare combination in concept.  Oh, I got my quixotical.

Last weekend was one of the first sunny weekends in San Francisco. Slightly windy, but sunny nonetheless. I woke up and thought: "It's a Dolores Park day." After a picnic of baguettes, salami, Italian truffle cheese (from Trader Joe's - REALLY good!) we looked at the line for Bi-Rite and decided it was a must. I had only been here once before, and had never waited in line. The anticipation grew with every minute. Finally we were up at the counter. Honey lavender or salted caramel? I couldn't decide. I got both. 10 minutes of pure ice cream cone joy followed.

The person who helped us was super friendly, and you can taste ANY flavor you want, even if you don't want to buy any! I tried the Honey Lavender ice cream, just because...Where else can you find such a flavor?  It actually was very tasty and fragrant. My wife and kids has Roasted Banana flavor, and were crazy about it too. Parking is hard to find, but then again...where in San Francisco is parking not a problem?

At first glance you would think that the flavors are a little over the edge. But oh was it good. I wish i could have more. I went on Friday at around 1:00pm. Only 1 person in front of me, but I was ready to wait. Usually when I pass this place I'm on the UCSF shuttle coming from SFGH. I had never heard of this place and all of a sudden I see a long line out the door. I was getting so jealous of all those people that I had to try it for myself. I got a recommendation to get salty caramel. then someone told me it was too salty. (depends on your taste buds) read some reviews and people raved about the salty caramel. I got the SALTY CARAMEL AND ROASTED BANANA. I WANT MORE! the Salty Caramel was not too salty for my tastes. And the Roasted Banana was not roasty or too banana. the prices range from $3.25 to i think $8 depending on what you get. They have sundaes, combos with brownie, and they even make their own chocolate. next trip i'm getting coffee toffee and something else. go try it for yourself.

Bi-rite is at the top of SF's ice cream list along with Mitchell's and Polly Ann's. Each one has a special place in our heart. If Mitchell's is old-fashioned goodness and Polly Ann's is Asian fusion, well, Bi-rite is gourmet ice cream. The first thing you'll remember about Bi-rite is it's space. It's located a block away from Dolores Park, so on hot summer days, you and your friends should hop on over and grab a cone or two. There are no yogurt shops around, so this is one nabe that's fad-free. So far, we've liked every flavor we tried: salted caramel, creme fraiche, honey lavender, ginger brown sugar, coconut, and cinnamon with snicker doodle. However, salted caramel is our tried-and-true favorite. Parking can be a bit tough in this area, so be aware of the $10 taxi ride out to the Dolores Park. That's a $15 all-inclusive ice cream for you, but it's worth every penny.

I went there for the first time less than a week ago, and my punch card already has the five out of ten punches required for a free scoop.   I haven't tried many, but my favorite flavores are the malted vanilla and the salted caramel.  I've been looking for the Haagen Dazs version of salted caramel if anyone knows were to find it.

Yum ice creamo. On a nice Friday night, the line wasn't particularly long. It reached the end of the block but I've heard of it wrapping around before. So from the window of the women's boutique shop, it should take around 15-20 minutes to get in your order. Of course if the people in front of you are sampling every other flavor, it's gonna take longer. I went with the strawberry sorbet which tasted very good. Refreshing and not too sweet. And for my second scoop, I got the salted caramel which tasted a tad like coffee and a tad like toffee. Overall, a very interesting and good flavor. The prices are great and they even have packaged ice cream in the fridge for quick pick'ens.

Mmm... Salted Caramel ice cream... gaggghhh... it's addicting!! I'm craving it right now!!  The place gets pretty crowded! I went there on a Wednesday night before they were about to close and the line was still out the door. Like most good ice cream places, you get to try out the flavors before you commit to one. The Roasted Banana is pretty tasty... very banana-y... not very roasty... I don't recommend the Honey & Lavender... As my friend said.. "It tastes like spa.."   Parking is impossible since it's the Mission, or... well, SF for that matter... but if you can make it over there, then do give it a try.

Stumbled across this place randomly once with "CBG." We were craving ice cream one random Sunday and looked this place up on yelp. It had great reviews so decided it was worth trying. The flavor selection is plentiful, with lots of options. They also have a wide variety of toppings and sauces, I got chocolate and cookies & cream with the fugde topping, absolutely delicious. It was so nice, creamy, and just the perfect amount of sweetness. They even take plastic, which is unusual for a little ice cream place in the city. Only complaints and recommendations:   - No waffle cones, just sugar cones, a little bit of a surprise. - Just one chocolate flavor, would like to see a lot more variety in chocolate. And this place is cheap, $7 for two people, much cheaper than most ice cream places, and so much better. Two thumbs up for this place. Parking is a pain in the mission, so be prepared to look.

I'm a major tart frozen yogurt fan, but even then, I can appreciate the goodness and creaminess of Bi-Rite. However, it's just not for me. I tried the salted caramel, which tasted great, but was too sweet; the cherry almond, too sweet and didn't taste like much; brown butter pecan, too sweet; balsamic strawberry, pretty good. All the flavors were spot on, but they were just overly sweet for someone used to tart fro yo. HOWEVER, ice cream lovers will love this place. Great flavors, creamy ice cream. All my friends love it.

Yes, people.  It is all that it's cracked up to be. I'm not sure I have anything to say that hasn't already been said.  My favorite flavors are the roasted banana, strawberry balsamic, the one that has Ritual coffee in it, and of course, the salted caramel.   It don't get no more San Francisco than Bi-Rite. UPDATED:  The Bi-Rite Soft Serve is minimalistic and it's fantastic.  I've had the malted vanilla, chocolate, and the salted caramel and by far my favorite is the malted vanilla/chocolate swirl.  So simple. And for those who complain that it's $3.50:  That's the same price as the ice cream and you NEVER have to wait in line for soft-serve.  I always laugh at the suckers who stand shivering in that line as I walk by with my cone.  Trust me, you'll be just as satisfied.

Since I live in Berkeley, Ici is just a quick hop, jump, and skip away.  I love being surprised by their delicious, innovative flavors. Last Friday a friend took us to Bi-Rite, of which I've heard many good things.  Apparently their flavors don't change too much, but that's okay with me if they really nail them.  Bi-Rite definitely does.  I had a single of the honey lavender and salted caramel.  It was a match made in heaven.  The honey lavender now takes its place as my favorite ice cream flavor of all time.  The ice cream is so creamy, and the flavors are so yummy.  When I find something I really like, I'm reluctant to try anything else.  I don't see myself ordering anything else on future visits.

Do not be discouraged by the long line. The wait is amazingly worth it. OK get ready. Malted Vanilla w/peanut brittle pieces, Balsamic Strawberry, Salted Caramel, Creme Fraiche, Honey Lavender, Brown Butter Pecan and so on and so forth plus toppings galore and not to mention the variety of ice cream sandwiches and Popsicles. I'm not going to over analyze the taste of ice cream flavors because I'm lazy and ice cream is good period, HOWEVER the ice cream here is special. Special how? A pixie, a fairy and a sprite had a threesome and Bi-Rite Ice cream was the end result. But don't take MY word for it. Butterfly in the SKYYY! I can fly just as HIGH...! Levar Burton, what's up!?

I had heard about this place through one of the culinary magazines that finds its way to our house on a monthly basis.  Here's how it goes -- I read an article about the best ice cream shops in the U.S., and the one mentioned in S.F. is *not* Mitchell's.  Curiosity piqued.   We try on a Friday night after dinner in the Mission.  Haha...no.  No way, no how - not gonna find parking.  Not to mention, there's a line around the corner of the building. Second try, this time a Sunday afternoon.  Still little chance of finding parking, and there's still a line around the building.  "Hmmm...this place must be very good."  One helpful technique we found was to have the folks in the backseat of the car go wait in line while we found parking.  Sure enough, by the time we made it back to Bi-Rite, our friends were next-in-line for ordering.  Score! Everyone in our group ordered doubles.  There was mint chip, chocolate coconut, chocolate, strawberry balsamic, roasted banana, and toasted coconut.  I think everyone came away from the experience satisfied and having enjoyed their ice cream very much.   So, why only 3 stars?  It just wasn't THAT good.  Consider it 3.5 stars, but instead of rounding up, I'm rounding down.  If I lived in the neighborhood, this could easily be the regular spot to visit.  Is it worth driving all the way from San Jose just for a scoop?  Not so much.  If I happen to be in the area and have a craving for ice cream, is it THEN worth it?  Maybe.  It depends on the parking situation...  I'll circle the block a couple times, but I'm not going to go out of my way (and risk getting a ticket for more "creative" parking techniques) just for a scoop.   Mitchell's is not too far away by car, and they have a parking lot (albeit small).

Had the Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Chocolate. Good stuff! BUT, docking one star for the way that they hurry you down the line. Understandable with the 50 other people lining up on the street, but the guy's attitude was not that great. And, in comparison to Scoops in LA and Marianne's in SC, this ice cream parlor loses a little bit of it star power. Oh, and no places to sit inside! :(

Salted Caramel kid size with hot fudge sauce, $3.00. DANG, that's pricey! Never would've tried this flavor but a friend said it could not be missed. I am not an ice cream fan, more of a salt tooth gal, but it was mighty good. I only went bc it was the first time that I ever saw the place without an enormous line, Wed night around 5-6pm, in case you want to try. There is a good assortment of flavors, but not a lot in the sorbet or dairy free zones. They do offer tastes without hesitation though, and that gets props. Also, they use organic Strauss creamery dairy, so don't worry about unnecessary antibiotics, but don't forget where veal comes from. As this is the highest number of reviews I have ever seen on YELP, you know that you have to try it. Don't bother reading any more, get on over there.

Bi-Rite Creamery is a little gem near Dolores Park.  Parking is limited (but if you come on a Sunday - one of the lanes on Dolores Street is closed off for parking, church I suppose).  Since I went relatively early, around 2:30, the line was short.  I felt like I didn't have enough time to decide.   I got a scoop of the Toasted Coconut and Ricanelas (cinnamon  with snickerdoodles) in a cone and it was SO DELICIOUS!  I'm a sucker for gourmet/homemade desserts!  However, I do think that Bi-Rite leans towards people with a sweeter tooth.  But I will definite pay Bi-Rite a visit next time I'm in the neighborhood. :] Lucky me, by the time I left Dolores Park, around 5, the line had stretched out to the end of the block.

At 1668 reviews, this spot really is as good as it gets. Flavor combinations I've tried are the brown sugar/ginger with salted caramel, brown sugar/ginger with roasted banana, and the brown sugar/ginger joint by itself. It's the caramel in it that makes it hella good.. I have a caramel tooth ;-)  [inside joke] I had my doubts about trying this place out, but I'm glad I finally made it here. And even if the line looks hella long, it goes by quickly. Check out the tat of an ice cream cone on one of the servers too, it's pretty sick

Had to try Bi-Rite after so much hype from local friends and yelp! I thought it was quite good.  The reason I rated it only 3 stars is that they use Straus Creamery products to make their ice cream, but the Straus Creamery ice cream you can buy at the grocery is still better!   Even so, this place sells organic ice cream, has a multitude of unique flavors to choose from and seems to do it the old fashioned way.  That's the way it should be! P.S. The day we went it was hot as balls, so waiting in a long freaking line that day, SUCKED...

On with my search for a good gelato joint, I was drawn to Bi-Rite by the constant lines and word of mouth. I was mildly disappointed. The consistency slightly too frozen, the texture slightly dry and a dark chocolate flavor slightly "un-rich" and "un-dark". Not enough for all the hype. A-Ok.

Had to check it out from word of mouth and the reviews on yelp etc. The line last night was not crazy at all at 6:30 pm. I had the salted caramel and toasted bananna. It was very good....but I think there are better in San Fran...namely Swensens and Mitchell's(which the line is always very long). Bi rite has unique flavors...very boutiquey  honey lavander etc....the flavors are nice but not very strong. The texture is nice smooth and creamy. The staff is very nice helpful and patient. I would go back...but I would rather go to the other two mentioned above.

RICANELAS ICE CREAM!! Tried a cake from Bi-rite...ricanela + banana ice cream and gingerbread cake and fell in looooove! I craved it the next day so I drove across town just so I can get a pint of Ricanela ($7.95) and guess what? I took one bite and my whole family finished it off before I could get another bite of goodness. So a few days later, my friend's birthday rolls around, and I volunteer to order a cake from Bi-rite..YES..the exact same Ricanela+banana ice cream and gingerbread cake and let me tell you 5 small asian girls can swipe down a 12 inch- no problemo! (Be forewarned, you must order the cake at least 2-3 days in advance).

I'm still amazed by this place. We were in SF dropping off my sister and decided to stop here. First off, the line was around the corner (again) of the block...not kidding. But these people are so efficient that we were at the front in less than 10 minutes. And the ice cream? I will truly never get tired of the flavors. I tried the Brown Butter Pecan. It was heavenly. And of course I got the salted caramel. Sigh, rich, smooth and decadent. My stomach thanks me though for not going too often since it's full for a good chunk of time after!

It's good.  I'm not going to lie.  Read all the reviews.  Expect a wait..whenever you go.  Particularly when the sun is out and it's a beautiful day in SF or at least Dolares Park!  You can tell the ice cream is super fresh especially since they sell it pretty much 24/7.  Great flavors and a wide variety of choices.   Parking is bad - but it's the mission!  I'd advise you make use of those Nikes you own or PT.

A mix between gelato and ice cream - not as creamy as ice cream and not a rich as gelato.  If you've never been here are a few of my faves: 1. Chocolate - safe choice 2. Toffee Coffee - if you're a mocha/coffee/toffee fan 3. Balsamic Strawberry - tastes better then it sounds and not too fruity

Oh my gawd - caramel and salt!!!! Holy moly is that good. Took forever to go here, never was a good time to get ice cream. When we're in the neighborhood it's after a big dinner or we can't find parking, so one night went in our jammies when my girlfriend was in town. It was now or never. I am so glad we went. I keep tasting that ice cream, rich and creamy and oh so delicious. The sweet and salty is the right combo and they compliment each other without either being overpowering. It was worth the wait in line in our jammies.

I've been here more than a couple of times and I have friends who really love it here, but, honestly, I really can't get too into it. The location is great, right on 18th and Dolores street. Great place to be right after a super sunny day (rare in SF) in Dolores Park. The ice cream is really good, but honestly, I don't find anything special about it. I guess that's because in Mexico the ice creams are extremely, extremely, extremely varied and ALL organic and natural. I even find Mitchel's, Bombay Ice Cream and Belgano's more exciting than this place. The flavors here, I feel, try too hard to be different and aren't flavorful enough, nor do they have a nice consistency. The staff's nice, super energetic and cheery. I will continue to come here often, as long as there isn't a mile long line of awed and thirsty Noe/Mission dwellers.

The Good: + great quality + unusal flavors + great location near Dolores Park + they're eco friendly - they use metal taster spoons instead of plastic ones and disposable cups The bad - kind of pricey, single scoop @ $3.25 but at least you get two flavors - not a lot of inside seating, though they have benches outside - but not ideal during windy/foggy/rainy weather Flavors worth trying: * Earl Grey - tastes like milk tea! * Chocolate Coconut (vegan) - you wouldn't even know you're missing the milk! * Roasted Banana - wow!

I love the different flavors they have at this place.  It's a wonder how they come up with these unusual but fantastic flavors!  I always get a scoop of honey lavender and a scoop of salted caramel... they go great together!  I haven't tried their cookies and stuff.. but they always smell good and look tasty! OK.. now footnote... No place for ice cream is worth waiting in a line that goes around the block!  This is usually the case for Bi-Rite on a nice sunny day! If the wait is long... you can always go to the Bi-Rite market across the street a few buildings down and get a small tub of it!

It's a little ice cream shop and when you walk in, all you see is a hugh display of exotic ice cream flavors.  Luckily, when I went it was raining, so the line was not too long.  The girls that work there are soo charming and friendly.  If you can't decide, they are the go-to people. Just like Mitchell's and Ici, they make their own ice cream fresh and from stratch!  They have a decent selection of uncommon flavors and pairings.  My favorite was the honey lavender.  Just the right amount of sweetness.  In my ice cream, you can see little specs of lavender flowers.  Yummm!

Salted-caramel ice cream at Bi-Rite Creamery is DA BOMB! Why didnt they invent this when I was a kid?!?!? $2.95 for a kid's size (but actually pretty big). $1 more each size larger. Well worth it. I have had this multiple times, but needed to do this again for the 7x7 challenge. Sometimes its too salty, but this time just right. Kicks off pretty strong with salty taste then sweet caramel sinks into your tongue and hits your sweet tooth. We also got the Pineapple-Raspberry Popsicle for $1.95 - great combo.

So I FINALLY got to try this place the other night because my sister was in town & was dying to go here!!! Thank God for my BF who dropped us off and drove around the block to find parking. And since it was a Tuesday night there was no line & we were able to order right away. I ordered the Salted Caramel (to see what all the hype was about) and it was delicious! My sister ordered the Sam's Sundae because she saw it on the Food Network. I  have to admit the olive oil was interesting.. I didnt like it at first, but it started to grow on me. The whipped cream that came w/ the Sam's Sundae was SUPERB! It was sooo fresh & just melted in my mouth!! I also got to taste the Roasted Banana... next time i go i wanna get the Roasted Banana Sundae and maybe take a few personal sized packs of ice cream home =D

With that in mind, I will just say that the cinnamon ice cream with the snickerdoodle cookie pieces is the most amazing ice cream flavor ever!

BI-RITE ice-cream = yummy they have all these favor's you would want to taste, and you must taste them all. My favorites Coffee Toffee, Earl Grey, and Roasted Banana. I'm not a big banana ice cream fan, but you gotta try it, it is so yummy definitely not an overwhelming taste of ripe bananas (I think ripe bananas taste gross)... Honey Lavender is pretty good too, but you must like flowers because it almost feels like your eating fragrance. The line is usually long, but it's worth the wait. Oh' the parking sucks.

Oh.My.DELICIOUS!!!! I had just finished up dinner over at Pizzeria Delfina with a couple of friends and we decided to polish our dinner off with ice-cream over at Bi-Rite. There was a line out the door but it gave us time to look at what we might want! After about 5 minutes of testing 10 different flavors, I settled on a mixture of honey lavendar and the salted caramel with macadamia nuts on top. The ice cream is so creamy and insanely rich! Somehow they managed to infuse the flavors without them being weird or over-powering and believe it or not - the combination of HL and SC were unbelievable. They have about 20 flavors for you to try and also have a variety of other offerings around the store ranging from cookies to macarons but everyone was clearly there for the ice-cream. There is also a fun menu of different sundaes and combinations up on the chalk board above the counter - which I totally plan on trying next time. The prices are obviously a little higher than your average ice-cream but nothing absurd. Our walk home with Bi-Rite's ice-cream was heaven!!! Even on a cold night - it was totally worth freezing our butts off even more with the ice cream! P.S. I got a pint of salted caramel to bring home and plan on ordering an ice cream cake for my best friend's birthday from here.

The salted caramel ice cream and roasted banana are true winners! Every time I go to Bi-Rite these are the two flavors I get. Yeah, yeah I know...I need to try the other flavors. But these were the first two flavors I tried and I've been hooked every since. Most definitely if you like sundaes -- theirs are worth trying. I personally just like ice cream the old fashion way - on a cone. No muss and no fuss. Bi-Rite definitely knows how to make ice cream! Hmmm...starting to crave some right now. Guess I know where I'll be going tomorrow .

First of all, I'm a sucker for places that let me taste the ice cream. I'm super indecisive, especially if I've never been there. I was all set to try the salted caramel, thanks to the intrepid reviews on Yelp, but then I tasted ginger and my mind was set. It's smooth, creamy, and just the right touch of ginger. Not too overpowering. The staff was friendly and patient, and for some tasty ice cream the price was pretty good. Way better than the Ben and Jerry's I had later that day. (Don't judge me, it was free ice cream day.)

Definitely over hyped and I would not go out of my way to come to this ice cream place. Since I was in the Mission my curiosity got the better of me so my friends and I hauled a$$ at 10:30pm on a Saturday night to get some Bi Rite before they closed.  We got there around 10:45pm and the line was still out the door.  Crazy! This place must be good! Maybe I was too full from dinner and the ice cream was good but NOT to die for. I had a taste of the honey lavender and I thought it was too fragrant and reminded me of hand cream.  Tried my friend's Earl Grey and it was yummy! Definitely a flavor I would get next time.  Other friend got Salted Caramel and it was just ok.  Interesting but didn't knock my socks off.  I went with my safe bet - mint chip and it was good.  Creamy. Sweet. Comparable to Mitchels? I think so. At least the line at Bi-Rite actually moves! I can't believe I waited an hour at Mitchels to eat ice cream.  ONE HOUR! I think if i lived near the Mission and didn't own a car I would frequent Bi-Rite.  The ice cream is definitely better than Dreyers/Ben & Jerry's or Baskin Robbins.  A million times better than Cold Stones (eck!)

My beloved Bi-Rite Creamery, I love you dearly and wish to spend the rest of my life with you and make babies for every flavor there is, especially Salted Caramel and Coffee Toffee. I know our babies will get very far just like the quart of salted caramel ice cream I had in my freezer for 2 months and still tasted amazing. Even though it'll cost quite a bit to raise all our awesomely flavored kids, it'll be worth every penny. All your friendly servers can attend our wedding and baby showers. When I make enough money, we can have muffin and cake babies too. Please accept my love, I am willing to circle around the block endless times to find a ridiculous hard-to-find parking spot just to visit you. I am forever yours.

I like how you can get two flavors in one!~ like i got a small cup with those two flavors. Chocolate was chocolate, not much I can say about it. Mint chip was good! very refreshing and tasty . Later I tried the salted caramel and that was AMAZING!!! LOVED IT!~ I needed some water because of the richness. It's my favorite so far. When i visit san fran again I'll definately come back!

This is a super cute ice cream place! I sampled three really great flavors. If I could, I would have gotten three scoops. 1. Salted caramel- favorite flavor and what I ended up getting. It's a mixture of salty sweet! 2. Roasted banana- Creamy and probably perfect for a milkshake. 3. Ricanelas- It tasted like a really delicious cinnamon sugar cookie.

How is it possible that I haven't written a review for Bi-Rite yet? Bi-Rite is heaven, pure and simple.  I lust after their ice cream like I've never lusted for any other ice cream before.   It's so good that two visits in one day in the city is almost mandatory and three visits not unthinkable.   My flavor combination of choice: Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl and Ricanelas (Cinnamon and Snickerdoodles) Yes, I have had Humphry Slocombe, and while their stuff is tasty, it doesn't hold a candle to Bi-Rite.   Bi-Rite, I love you.  Will you marry me?

Came here with the Boy both yesterday and today (we had heard about this place from a SF pal, who raved that it was unbelievably delicious -- she was right!) and the line was really long, but we didn't mind because the weather was great, the people in line interesting to talk to (we filled out voter registration forms for SF while in line), and the prize -- delicious, fresh, interesting, smooth, ice cream -- well worth the wait. Yesterday, he got the Berry Sundae and I a scoop of Salted Caramel and a scoop of Roasted Banana. I loved the caramel flavor -- everything I was hoping and more. The Roasted Banana was remarkable in how banana-y it tasted, but got kind of boring after a few bites. The Boy's Berry Sundae was so great -- chewy gingersnap chunks, fresh (thick) whipped cream, blueberry sauce with tiny, tart blueberries, and thick vanilla ice cream. So so good. Today we split a Sam's Sundae (chocolate ice cream, bergamot and olive oils, and sea salt) and all I can say is that everything is better with olive oil and sea salt. I also tasted the Honey Lavender flavor and he the Mint Chocolate Chip and we can't wait to come back to have cones of those flavors. Go there! Go there now! If you're reading this review while in line, I hope this review builds your anticipation to a fever pitch, because BOY ARE YOU ARE IN FOR SUCH A TREAT.

The ice cream is truly to die for here.  And the creme fraiche is unmatched.  Get a hot fudge sunday with marcona almonds and fresh whipped cream and you are in heaven. But it's so popular with the hipsters, that more often than not there is an obnoxious line around the block that takes an hour to get a cone.   Come on people, it's just ice cream!  ;)

There is literally nothing you can contribute to a place which has received over 2,000 reviews. However, one tip: Make sure you are a fan of the specific flavor you are choosing. The flavors are VERY strong - I tasted honey lavender yesterday and it was very lavender-y. My second choice the coffee toffee had an extremely strong coffee flavor, which reminded me more on cold espresso due to the bitterness than coffee. I surely enjoyed my flavors to the fullest, but really make sure you love the flavor you going for.

Finally bit the bullet and drove over after dinner to check out the rave reviews of the salted caramel. I thought the salted caramel was very good, but not as great as the hype says it is. More memorable was the honey lavender and the earl gray flavors. I came at about 8:30 in the evening, so the line was short. What's great is that after getting ice cream I was able to walk over to Bi-Rite market and sample their cheese. I ended up leaving with a bar of chocolate bacon. Go figure.

I rarely scream in reviews, but I need to say just one thing: RICANELAS!!!!!!!! Wooh, now that I got that out of my system (even without a reference to that mildly annoying childhood rhyme). My advice is to eat it and cherish every bite because no matter what size you get, you are going to want more.

Salted Caramel ice cream! Need I say more? But if that's not your flavor, they have a lot more. And just like other ice cream parlors, you can try them out before to help you decide. I ordered the salted caramel ice cream and the roasted banana. Together, it was delicious! I'm Filipino, so having this combo reminded me of a "turon" (friend banana in a lumpia wrapper). The workers here were very friendly. The girl who helped me was very nice and patient as I tried to figure out which flavors I wanted and as I kept asking for samples. So definitely a plus for their great customer service :)

Bi-Rite you make my day right.  When I'm down you turn my frown around. You're the skip in my step on a good day. You're the way everyone should end their day. I brag to all my friends about you, I drag them to you when they're in town. Duuuude, srsly, Salt & Caramel? Lilikoi & Mango? Coffee & Toffee? Snickerdoodle cookie dough?! Swoons*! Bi Rite's always combining things I already looove and they do it well. It's a party in my mouth. It blows me away. It makes me so happy. They even combine things I didn't know would taste so wonderful together... I mean, Balsamic & Strawberries?! Honey & Lavender?! I love ice cream & I know my ice cream, I'll travel far and wide for the milk based goodness. Heck I can eat it for breakfast, lunch, dinner, AND midnight snack! With that said, Bi-Rite blows ice cream out of the park. I urge you to come and indulge. Le Sigh... Bi-Rite makes my heart beat a little faster. ps. please try their salted caramel cupcakes. oh boy. deeelish!

The best ice cream of my life! Riconela + Honey Lavendar is an amazing combination. Even separately they're mind-blowing flavors. You can get a sample of whatever you'd like. Also take note that they have special flavors on different days. (I was disappointed when I saw they had mexican chocolate ice cream only on tuesdays). It's a regular stop on my San Fran trips now :)

I've driven by here so many times and every time there's always a line, even when it was freezing.  ok, I'm exaggerating but it was definitely cold and people still lined up for ice cream.  nobody in their right mind would be eating ice cream in the cold.  but then again, there were plenty and that definitely means something. my first bi-rite experience was during a KFT event I worked.  the lady purchased two ice cream cakes for her son's bday.  she gave us a slice of the coffee toffee ice cream cake and a slice of malted vanilla ice cream cake.  both were really good. for my second experience I actually lined up.  the line went down to the corner.  it wasn't too bad, about a 5-10 min wait.  there were some very interesting flavors I wanted to try.  I ended up ordering the cherry almond.  they did not disappoint.  I actually wanted more but didn't want to overindulge. bi-rite deserves nothing less than five stars.  the service was great and the ice cream is just heavenly.  now I understand why people would stand in line in the cold freezing their butts off for ice cream.  their ice cream is so good that I'll actually wait in the freezing cold freezing my butt off.

Definitely a solid ice cream place. I can't say it's better or worse than Mitchell's, but what I can say is that it's different. It's flavor's dont necessarily compare to Mitchell's. A few things to note is that the line can be long and expect to wait 15 to 20 minutes to get your ice cream. I really enjoyed the roasted banana, Can't complain :)

I have to say I'm a little disappointed :( After reading all of the stellar reviews on Yelp i was expecting ice cream utopia!  I know i'm a bit spoiled after years of eating Eiger Ice Cream down south, so i was so excited to hear that there was a possibility of something just as good here in SF after Eiger closed.... To start with the positives (+) flavors are creative and inventive (+) taste is good but not great (we had the salted caramel, seasonal flaovor (cinnamon), chocolate and cherry almond) (+) service is friendly Disappointment (-) Texture of the ice cream was not great, ice cream for me is about flavor AND texture (icy chunks, not as smooth and creamy as i'd expect) (-)the crazy lines (-) cherry almond was bland, chocolate was too icy and not creamy

It was a sunny and warm day, and we happened to be in the area. We walked over from Dolores park, when we go there, there was a line. It wasn't too long. When I got inside, it smelled so GOOD. The customer service was really good. The lady who took my order was so nice and funny. I decided to get two flavors- roasted banana and salted caramel. OHMYGOD. It was like ice-cream heaven. IT WAS FANTASTIC. I also tried the flavors, honey lavender and balsamic strawberry . The honey lavender has this incredibly, unique taste. The strawberry one was just okay. On the other hand, it did taste really fresh! I can't wait to go back!

It's Friday and as the fog is begining to roll in over Dolores Park, I have the realization that I MUST have ice cream before leaving SF!! How is it that not even chilly temperatures will keep people away from Bi Rite??!! I must have skipped from the shop all the way to BART, savoring every single spoonful of my salted caramel and honey lavender scoops..... Heavenly; that is the only way to describe the flavors. A marriage of really good ingredients and amazing flavors (oh god, I am drooling all over my keyboard thinking about it....). I thought of buying a pint, then imagined myself eating it on the way home on BART, guess I'll have to simply trek out to the city every now and then for this amazing treat!!

Salted Caramel is as amazing as everyone says! It reminds me of Filipino leche flan...sweet, creamy caramel with a tinge of burnt/smokeyness mmmm Also tried... Coffee Toffee - Almost as good as Häagen-Dazs Toasted Coconut -  Yummy but the coconut pieces could have been less chunky and more shave-y Honey Lavender - This was good but not my favorite. The lavender was strong in this batch...kinda tasted like soap =X Also, the line was long but moved at a good pace -- long enough for me to decide what flavors to try and fast enough to get that creamy goodness in my tummy! I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town =)

Best freaking ice cream I have ever had in my entire life--and no I'm not being dramatic. I really do think this is the best ice cream I've ever had. This is better than Mitchell's and WAY better than that piece of crap tasting Humphrey Slocombe or however you spell it. Who actually likes Humphrey?! Bleck. If you want great flavor, come here! I always get the salted caramel (what they're known for) and the roasted banana. I've tried others--but those are the two flavors that are the best in my opinion. The best thing about it is that everything tastes exactly as it's written. The staff is great--so accommodating and always patient. Love this place!

Came here after a meeting with a counselor at USF.  I needed a pick me up so ice cream was the answer! Samples: -brown sugar with ginger-I'm not a fan of ginger, but I actually enjoyed it a lot. -Coffee Toffee-MMMmm Mmmm GOOD -Roasted banana-not too much banana and it was just right. -Salty caramel-salty, sweet, richness from the caramel.  It was awesome. I was holding up the line so I finally decided on the honey lavender and the balsamic strawberry. I usually shy away from lavender, but couldn't say no the the honey :) I was worried that the lavender would overpower the honey, but it didn't.  It balanced out really well where my ice cream didn't taste that much like soap.  I can taste the honey on it's own so that saved it.  The balsamic strawberry was a lot better.  It was creamy, but I can still taste each ingredient on it's own.  Everything was very well balanced.   After ice cream, I couldn't resist but order a lemon icing cupcake and a fresh mint chocolate cupcake.  I wasn't too fond of the lemon cupcake because it was too dense, but the icing was AWESOME!  the fresh mint chocolate cupcake was ooohhhh so GOOD!  I can taste the freshness of the mint, the cake was moist and had hidden chunks of chocolate in the icing and the cake!  It was like a reward with every bite. I enjoyed my yummy treats right outside on the wooden benches on a slightly chilly day, but enjoyed the ice cream anyways.  I also laughed when this dog attempted to walk his owner into Bi-Rite and wouldn't budge when the owner tried to pull him away.

We drove by this place the other day and noticed there wasn't a line... knowing all the hype (and the line) which usually surrounds it, we decided it was a good time to try it. Good icecream, fun flavors. Would I wait in a line going all the way around the block? Probably not.

They have vegan ice cream! I'm not vegan but I'm lactose intolerant! For those of you who don't understand what that means - if I have any kind of milk product I've got about 4.5minutes to find a bathroom before I mess my pants and yes I've tried the lactose pills and all that other stuff and all it does is buy me about 3 more minutes of bathroom hunting time. So for a place as awesome as Bi-Rite to serve vegan friendly ice cream is fricken awesome! Especially when it's Chocolate Coconut Ice Cream!

Bi-Rite has the best ice cream in the whole world, amen, the end. Everything is made with organic and local products, and their flavors rock my world. Salted caramel? Yum! Brown butter pecan? Oh, I die! Ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodle chunks)? I pine! Malted vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate pieces? I PERISH! The line can get long, even in the cold, and with good reason. It usually goes pretty fast, and it is worth the wait, I swear.

I love salted caramel candy, so I was couldn't-contain-myself excited when I discovered a local establishment serving Salted Caramel ice cream.  The ice cream, however, just didn't live up to the wait-in-line-for-45 minutes-in-windy-cold-SF hype.  There was a slight bitter after taste from the strong caramel flavor.  Maybe I just prefer more of a milky caramel.  Oh well, at least I got to cross off another must-do on the list. P.S. Don't hate me for the 3 stars!  I'm a good person, I swear!

Salted Caramel: O.M.G.  SSSSOOOO GOOD! I've heard so many good things about this place that I decided that I had to try it. So I tried the salted caramel. I loved how the saltyness complimented the sweet caramel flavor. The ice cream itself is also so creamy and delicious. Oh man i really want some more right now just thinking about it. Though it may be expensive and sometimes a lot of people it is well worth it.

This is the best ice cream that I've tasted thus far. I went here once on a sunny Sunday afternoon, and you know that there will be a line forming around the corner on a sunny day. My friends and I waited about half an hour until we got in the ice cream shop. I ordered the salted caramel and honey lavender on a cone. The salted caramel was my FAVORITE! It tasted so good. You definitely need to try the salted caramel here. The honey lavender tasted like what you would smell when you walk into Bath & Body Works, but I still enjoyed it. I don't think I would be getting that flavor again though. It's hard to find parking around here. You can also go to Dolores Park to enjoy your ice cream with other people as well :)

Who was at Bi-Rite when it was like..90 degrees in SF? I was. Not only was the line long, but that place was blasting some heat! Maybe it was the heat from the refrigeration, but it was just as hot inside as it was outside. Well, maybe this is their ploy to get people to buy more ice cream? Anyways. True to all the yelpers out there who have raved about the ice cream here, I tried their salted caramel, toasted coconut, and honey lavender. They were all delicious in their own way, but the lavender kind of made me feel like I was eating potpourri. Haha. I wish this place was a little bigger, because I love creameries like Fenton's, where I can sit down and enjoy a huge sundae in a roomy restaurant that has breezy cold a/c.

I'm not s huge fan of sweets but because of all the awesome reviews my my friends and from yelpers, I wanted to get my bf an ice cream birthday cake from here. I called in for my order and got the Balsamic Strawberry ice cream with yellow cake and toasted meringue. Let me just say OMG it was amazing!! Everyone at dinner LOVED it and even thought they were full from dinner and dessert, the cake was all gone at the end of the night! Adding onto the amazing taste of their ice cream, the staff there was incredibly friendly and helpful when I went to pick up the cake. I didn't have to wait in line and even after I paid for the cake, I wanted to sample a few of their flavors, they gave it to me no questions asked! AWESOME! I would definitely go back here to try their Earl Grey when its back in season...i think Winter time only. But I'm a fan of their toasted coconut and balsamic strawberry flavor for sure!

you CANT go to SF without hitting up the 7x7 100 things you must eat before you die list right?! well Bi-Rite is included in that list for its salted caramel ice cream so we hopped over to the SHORT LINE at off peak hours!!! HORRAY for "1 scoop" including 2 flavors!!! ---salted caramel was a dissapointment... i dont know why.. but it tasted burnt to all of us.. none of us enjoyed it!!!!! ---coffee toffee... SO GOOD.. coffee ice cream never fails & when you add buttery toffee its just that much better!! the ice cream is rich & thick, but if you aren't into ice cream, Bi-rite also has a soft serve/bakery window down the street with 2 diff flavors each day! ---mint chocolate soft serve was good ---picnic chocolate cake was okay.. kind of reminded me of boxed mix ---cookie sandwich.. looked better than it tasted... SKIP THE SOFT SERVE WINDOW.. DIVE INTO THE ICE CREAM LINE!

I think San Francisco when I think of Bi-Rite.  This place i think recently expanded within the last year, opening a seating area and a soft-serve window that also serves cupcakes.   Despite the long lines, service is always relatively quick.   Have unique flavors such as balsamic strawberry, honey-lavender and my all-time personal favorite - ricanelas (cinnamon/cream ice cream with freshly baked snickerdoodles).   Unfortunately, my boyfriend and I were not impressed with their sundaes.  Sam's Sundae (chocolate ice cream, bergamot olive oil, sea-salt and homemade whipped cream)  just tasted "off."  I am a fan of sweet and savory but the consistency of the olive oil, saltiness of the sea-salt and chocolate ice-cream did not bode well with me. Afternoon snack (roasted banana ice cream, homemade graham cracker crumbs, whipped cream and caramel sauce) was slightly better than Sam's Sundae but the homemade graham crackers also seemed a little too salty.

Home made ice cream. I always try and make a stop here when I'm in the area. If the line is too long then you can head to the front counter to the Bi Rite store and buy a pint. Worth a wait for this flavorful dessert. They also have a soft serve and bakery window a few doors down. Take your cone/cup and enjoy in front of the shop or walk over to nearby Mission-Dolores park or to Tartine Bakery at the end of the block.

I got the balsamic strawberry and creme fraiche which I thought was very yummy. My friends were equally happy with their choices of salted caramel and toasted coconut. It was a perfect dessert!

Expect a long line during weekends (especially in the summer), but they have the BEST SALTED CARAMEL EVER!! The soft serve salted caramel is especially delicious, on the days that you can catch it (m, w, sun). They always have the salted caramel ice cream though. Other good flavors are cookies and cream, malted vanilla with peanut brittle, roasted banana, coffee toffee, and brown butter pecan. Unlimited samples is an additional perk, and the staff is friendly and efficient. Don't forget to get your Bi-Rite punch card to work your way to free ice cream! A must stop if you happen to be in the Mission district on a weekday as there is rarely a line.

I come here whenever I'm down in the Mission and it's remotely hot. I'm a fairly boring ice cream eater and get stuff like the cookies and cream, mint chip, or the vanilla with peanut brittle. The vanilla with peanut brittle is good, but really sweet. I wouldn't recommend getting more than one scoop. Everything I've had here is great. My wife loves the honey lavender, which I personally think is gross. They're famous for their salted caramel, which is ok. If you ever are in the Mission, and it's hot. You'll definitely be waiting in a fairly long line. But don't worry, the line moves pretty fast. I don't think I've waited more than 15 minutes ever. Definitely give it a try if you're in the mission/dolores park area!

Anytime there is a line out the door wrapped around the corner, you know that whatever is in that building has got to be good. Thats Bi-Rite Creamery... This is what I ordered: Toasted banana Snickerdoodle Cookies n' Creme Honey Lavender -The toasted banana tastes exactly like you are biting into a ripe banana, really good if you're a nanner fan. -Snickerdoodle was out of this world! It has hunks of freshly baked snickerdoodle cookies throughout. This was by far my favorite!!! gimme a quart of that stuff. -Cookies n'creme was just okay, nothing too special. -Honey Lavender was very simple. Lovely on the palate and wasn't as floral as I thought it would be. It has a "pretty" taste, if that makes sense to anyone? LOVED BI-RITE CREAMERY! If ever in SF, stop by! No disappointments there!

An almost four thousand reviews and an average 4.5 star rating predisposed me to high expectations. Surprisingly, unlike other over-hyped establishments, Bi-Rite Creamery lives up to it's reputation! I am not sure if this is a daily thing, but when I came here on Friday evening, the line wrapped about the building. With good company, the wait was bearable. By the time I reached the front, I had already decided on what to order. I got myself two flavors: their famous salted-caramel (of course) and balsamic strawberry (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…). My friend also got two flavors: malted vanilla and toasted coconut. The salted-caramel was very unique! I am usually a fan of caramel and the slight hint of salt made for an interesting aftertaste. It reminded me of See's Candies caramel lollipops. The balsamic flavor in the balsamic strawberry wasn't as strong as I liked, but it was good. I also got to taste the toasted coconut and malted vanilla. My favorite out of all the flavors would have to be the malted vanilla! It contained just the right amount of peanut brittle that added a very nice crunch to the silky ice cream. The toasted coconut was good too, but I didn't think there was enough coconut pieces. I really like Bi-Rite Creamery because their ice cream is made fresh and they create very unique and organic flavors. They also make their very own ice cream cakes. Their staff is also very well trained and the prices are fair. I know you can't resist, so go check them out! Remember though, it's a teeny-tiny place, so don't plan on eating there!

I check in here whenever I make it down to the Mission: this place has definitely earned the popularity. Worth the lines! They've really found a good formula with the salted caramel. My experience with the other flavors has been a bit hit or miss, with the roasted banana scoring high and the malted vanilla a bit lame. I'm looking forward to the coffee toffee and ricanelas!

Who the hell puts orange oil in honey lavender ice cream? Sounds disgusting, but it was so good. I also had a scoop of the salted caramel...nice. Go eat, have a few drinks, and end the night at the creamery. Perfect Friday night.

I used to like your salted caramel ice cream, Birite, but that was before I had Berthillon in Paris. Your salted caramel is simply too sweet and not caramel-y enough. But I suppose I wouldn't mind some of your other flavors on a hot summer day, and only if I didn't have to wait in that ridiculous line.

Stopped by here after eatting dinner at Hog and Rocks and a 2nd dinner at Cha Cha Cha.  After getting totally wasted, I'm glad we walked by here on the way back. Salted Caramel and Honey Lavender - GET THIS!!! I liked having honey lavender on the side to compliment the strong flavor of the salted caramel.  Try getting one of the bags of cookies that they sell and crush it into your ice cream. You Will Not Regret It!

YUMM YUMM YUMM - the perfect place on a warm San Francisco day and people watch and laze around at nearby Dolores Park. This place is so friendly, always has a long line (which moves fast though, and you can always opt for the soft serve next door that has no line), but as they say, you have to wait for good things. I ama  fan of small, local businesses that care about what they put out and Bi-rite with its small batch, organic, creamy and flavorful product satisfies me absolutely! LOVE LOVE the Salted Caramel, Roasted Banana and the Honey Lavender (in that order) and even though they don't all go together, that does not stop me from doing just that :) There is the Bi-rite Grocery across the street (next to Delfina, another favorite) so you can stock up on that creamy salted caramel goodness!

Now I have an option for when Delfina's still full at 9pm and they won't let me in for dessert! I've only tried the salted caramel ice cream (really good), their ginger snap cookies (best ginger snap I've had), and their ginger ice cream (out of this world--though you have to be in the mood for non-ice-cream-flavored ice cream), but the creamery is getting a big thumbs up. They have a good mix of standards to go with their off-beat flavors. The ice cream falls someplace between gelato and regular ice cream--it's not your standard hard-serve scoops, so it's super creamy. (It doesn't bother me, but both times I've been helped, the employees have handled my cone with no gloves and no napkins. That's gonna drive some of the germaphobes away.)

Being that i just polished off a pint of the creamery's Butter Pecan ice cream I figured I should review it. Now I know that everyone LOVES the creamery, but i have to give this flavor only an eh. In fact to be honest the only way i was able to finish it ( 'cause at 8 bucks a pint it wasn't going into the garbage) was to crush up some strange candy bar I recently bought in Copenhagen and  then mix it in to the ice cream followed by a drizzling of Recchiuti Bitter-Sweet Chocolate Sauce (1000 stars for that stuff by the way). So why the four stars - their Ritual Coffee and Roasted Banana flavors ROCK my world. The Malted Vanilla with Chocolate Covered Rice Krispy treats is also pretty tasty though slim on the 'treats.' Plus this place is literally just across the park from me and when it is hot I am too lazy to walk very far.

My gf made this place out to be the best place EVER!!!!!!!!! Not quite. The flavor selection is poor. The ice cream is wonderfully creamy. If they didn't have the lavender-flavored selection, I wouldn't bother going back. To be fair, I'm not big on ice cream. However, Ralph's Italian Ices and Ben & Jerry's Chubby Hubby are exceptions. If you like ice cream and mint chocolate chip impresses you, go.

Bi-Rite Creamy + Me 4EVER! I loved the salted caramel ice cream - you start eating it and think, wow - this is good.. mmmm, shove more in your face and think -.. wait- that's really frickin good, shove more then finally, about to get back in line again for more. I also had the Peanut Butter with fleur de sel nuggets - superb! To top it off, they vibe in this closet of a space is super cute, fun and the nicest service in the city. I mentioned to the dude with the scooper that it was my friend's b-day. He made us take a mini banana split, oh with a caramelized banana thanks to his handy kitchen torch, sprinkled it with marcona almonds, big dollop of whip cream and a candle. that vanilla was sick good. Haagen-Dazs is ghetto vs. Bi-Rite.

So after eating Tartine's Jambon and some of my boyfriends pastrami sandwich that he couldn't finish, we thought that it would be a good idea to get something to cool off in the out of nowhere hot weather...So off we go to The Bi-Rite Creamery and their popular as hell long line. I'll say this first, I don't eat ice cream much because I am lactose intolerant to heavy amounts of dairy...cheese on the burgers I eat = nothing. Ice Cream at the creamery = A world of pain brought on by the deliciousness of the ice creams that they serve. I knew I would go with a classic cookies and cream, but I felt I should make the experience special and try out the Salted Caramel which was bliss on a cone....even thinking this, I still opted for the C&C....it pleases me...what can I say. I don't know if they rotate flavors but their selection is what demoted this 5 star with 5 big red ones review down to a 4 star review. I see no real reason to avoid coming here on a hot day....i'll be back when the real summer comes in September.

Mitchells used to reign over my tastebuds, but no more---Bi-Rite Creamery has stolen me away.  Oh my----if I lived nearer, I would eat here EVERY DAY! (and my internist would scold the heck out me for eating instant cardiac death)-----Instant cardiac death? Because there's no way ice cream this good could get that way without being seriously bad for you. Do note; these are adult flavors---although most people don't realize it, adding a little salt to sweet flavors adds depth and even intensity---but for people looking for "kid flavors", this isn't the place----that's OK, that just leaves more for ME!

This place rocks.  The salted caramel has been beautifully haunting my dreams since we first met.  Balsamic strawberry, cookies and cream, and roasted banana are all worth checking out.  Skip the chocolate peanut butter (I may have just tasted it on a bad night). For those of you who complain about the prices, there's a giant sign right above the counter that (SHOCKER!) lists the prices.  If you're going to get your nose out of joint because of how much it costs, then DON'T EAT HERE.  More for me! Mitchell's is good, Bi-Rite is better.  Brave the lines and shell out the $3 for a small cup with 2 flavors.  Just make sure that one of them is salted caramel.

For many reasons.... 1/ Salted Caramel: Yum-freakin-ers!!! :) Perfect blend of salty and sweet! 2/Toasted Banana Walnut: Oh....my heart be still. Little chunks of walnuts swirled into a perfectly sweet scoop of goodness! I love how this place lets you get a single scoop with 2 different flavors! Perfect for all those indecisive people...(Like me!) :) The staff is friendly and absolutely amazing. On my birthday, they dimmed all the lights, put a candle in my ice cream and had the whole store sing happy birthday! Wowsers! Definitely memorable!!

It was good.  Nice gourmet flavors.  But the ice cream quality itself was not better than Mitchell's.  Or, lord have mercy, the dreamy creamy quality of Emack and Bolio's in Boston.  That is an ice cream town. But Bi-Rite was good!  Good location of you can handle the hipsters.

I LOVE ice-cream.  Some of the best local ice-creams have crossed my mouth path (BlueBell Ice-Cream/TX, JP Licks/Boston, Mitchell's/SF)...   Well, I think the Bi-Rite Creamery has matched some of my favorites!!  Not only do they give Soup Spoon sized sample tastes, the flavors are amazing!!   All organic ingredients for those concerned about that with dessert foods.  Flavors like Honey Lavender, some Snickerdoodle flavor that's too good for it's own good, and Roasted Banana ---- rest assured, you won't be let down. Also, the classic Cookies & Cream is fully loaded.  I think "fully loaded" is a more acceptable term than "sesh".

Orange cardamom, butter brickle, salted carmel; the list goes on and on.   This is the single best ice cream in town.   Without a doubt.  You will be tempted to try and stock up on it in order to avoid the long lines and have plenty on hand at home.   Resist this temptation.   Ice cream is like a vacuum cleaner for freezer odors and crystallizes in funky ways over time.   Eat in fresh, get it here, and you will find just the right balance of creaminess, sugar, and flavor.   I salute you Bi-Rite Creamery!

It really don't get no bettah in this city. Seriously. I love Ice Cream.  And by love, I mean love.  In a sick way.  Like, if I was walking down the street and an old man in front of me was eating an ice cream cone...and had a heart attack....and keeled over --- well I'd give him mouth-to-mouth simply to be able to lick the cookies n cream from the insides of his mouth. Yeah.  Its like that. So Bi-Rite is sort of a little piece of heaven in my world.  It is kitty-corner to my weekend haunt (Dolores Park), only a few blocks away from the homestead (Castro Street), and has some of the most yum-o-rific flavors I've had the pleasure of licking off a spoon.   Scoops are pretty generous.  And the staff is also real nice about taste tests, which is helpful since a lot of the flavors will be new.  Some favorites include Malted Vanilla, Salted Caramel, Peanut Butter Fudge Swirl, Honey Lavender, Double Ginger ...mmm - I could go on & on.   The Brownie Sundae (2 scoops of ice cream - any flavor, a nice big chocolate brownie, whipped cream & spiced pecans) is a standby when I am feeling piggy.  There are some delicious ice cream sandwiches (more reminescent of it's-it's than your standard ice cream sammitch).  They also have an odd sundae - with sea salt and bergemot olive oil.  It's a trip.  Not bad at all ,and worth a try at least once to try something off the beaten path.  I've also tried the standard Banana Split, which comes with caramelized bananas (which they fire up right in front of you) as a sort of twist on the ol' standard. Anyway, the lines get a bit long (even on a Tuesday night, there's a line!), but it truly is well worth the wait.   Basically, this little gem is priceless.

The ice cream is so good here, it makes you feel like a kid again. Everything just fades away and all I can focus on is my delicious ice cream. I love that they have new flavors on a regular basis. Went in last week and they had Mexican chocolate with salted peanuts. Wow. Well done. I hope this becomes a regular offering. I am addicted to the salted caramel and the honey lavendar. I wish they had a little cart that came to you in Dolores Park. I guess they should have  few though because of the popularity - maybe they could hire the nice guy who roams around Dolores Park trying to sell the push-pops and rainbow flavored crap. He seems really nice.

This is damn good ice cream. I moved here from Chicago a couple months ago, where I lived near a frozen custard shop I loved. But Bi-Rite Creamery is a legit replacement. I'm currently subleasing a place just a few blocks from here, so I've been eating way too much ice cream. The Mexican chocolate / banana combo is my current fave. Love the ginger. And the Ritual toffee. Oh, and the mint chip is delicious. Not a big fan of the salted caramel (too sweet) or the lavender (too perfum-y tasting). If only they made black licorice flavored ice cream like the Tillamook Creamery in Oregon. So good. I have celiac disease and have to be on a gluten free diet. Ice cream is usually pretty safe, as long as there aren't cookies in it, so I took a chance the first time I went here and was fine. But, they list the ingredients for most of their ice creams on their website, in case you'd like to take a look. Can't give this place five stars because the customer service is usually pretty crappy. Most of the employees there are unfriendly. I've heard them get pretty pissy at times, which is annoying. It's Bi-Rite, you know what to expect, it's usually going to be crazy busy, the least you could do is try to be nice to customers. Or find another job. One of the girls working there was for some reason in a particularly good mood when I went the other day - so much so that she called me "sweetheart." Um, excuse me hun, I'm probably much older than you are, I don't appreciate you calling me sweetheart. Especially when you're usually really rude to me. How 'bout finding a middle ground? Mmm-kay?

I haven't set foot in the place, but I'll still swear Bi-Rite makes the best ice cream in the Bay Area. Had the honey lavender and salt caramel melting together in a bowl for dessert last night at a friend's dinner party.  It was so good it silenced a whole room full of blabbermouths for the first time during a long, fabulous meal. Can't wait to work my way down that list of flavors!

Delicious, fresh, creamy, and exotic ice cream flavors. The flavors just BLOOM on your tongue.  I envision rainbows and butterflies in a meadow of wildflowers every time I taste their ice cream.  Bi-Rite ice cream is not meant to be devoured.  It is meant to be respected, in all its glorifying ice cream sacredness. Yes, the salted caramel is all that and a bag of chips.  I love the ginger and the lavender ice cream as well, but I have always been adventurous when trying different and new flavors.  The vanilla malt is surprisingly good - I'm not a vanilla person, but the malt really comes through. WORTH IT.

Please people...this place was just alright. Here are the reasons why its just alright: - long lines out the door! Bi-rite needs to somehow get the line going faster...crowd control or something. Its the least they could do for people who have to wait upwards to 20 minutes to even get in the door. I can't imagine how it is on a super hot day in SF (good thing its hardly ever!). - its a little overpriced. I felt a little ripped off when I got the single for $3.25 which only had two very small scoops. I guess its a good place if you are watching your weight. Bi-rite would get 10 plus stars (if that ever becomes possible) if they were a little more generous with their portions. -no sitting room. They had only a few barstools inside. Good thing there's Delores park nearby. -Parking. Don't even bother about driving there. Get prepared to walk a bit or get dropped off. Ok, there are good things about Bi-rite! I like Bi-rite despite all those things I just mentioned above because: -Location! Honestly, I come to the City only a few times a year and this place proves to be on a good block. Like I said, next to Delores Park and easy to spot from the main street (maybe cuz there's a long line of people out the door). -Ice cream is pretty great! Smooth and interesting flavors- I especially liked the lavender one. -Patient staff. Maybe so patient that's why there's a line out the door. This review just made me realize that I'm just impatient when it comes to getting my ice cream. I need to chill and spend those minutes in line anticipating some good ice cream coming my way...

Ok there are already 1000+ reviews for this place so everyone knows its delicious already but man I still have to write out it. They've got some really unique flavors so its like a cool tasting expedition.  They also have the good ol' standby flavors for people less adventurous.  Man i got the butter pecan and there was like a chunk of butter still frozen in the ice cream! thats how real this stuff is!! so GOOD. The line can look crazy at times but it moves pretty fast so don't be scurred.  Goodluck with parking in the area though, it sucks.

I am hesitant to say this, given that I am such an ice cream fanatic and I'd like to leave the field open, but Bi-Rite may be the best ice cream I have ever had! I had a sugar cone with Salted Caramel and Roasted Banana ice cream.  Extremely creamy, unique, intense, complex flavors.  The portions are small but due to the complexity of the flavor, larger portions would really be unnecessary. This isn't the type of place to come if you just want to get your traditional fill (oversaturation?) of milk and sugar.   Would be nice if they had a bigger location so that the store would be more than just one big line, but really, the ice cream was so damn good that I can't complain!

OHH Goodness... so much goodness. Banana split me anytime! Oh with the vanilla malted ice cream... Two weeks ago I nearly killed for a taste of the balsamic strawberry. My husband is crazy for the honey lavender and the seasonal flavor of pumpkin makes our taste-buds festively happy! Grab a frequent ice creamer card when you're there, cause you're bound to be back... a lot. Please don't even try to compare this place with Mitchell's. It's so completely different! Mitchell's is good and has some great flavors, but it never feels personal... it's more of a novelty.  At Bi-Rite your orders are received with smiles and excitement as they fill you up with ice cream and treats made from local goods and ice cream made in quantities maintained to keep that homemade taste. Big plus is there single scoops can come in two flavors and you can try flavors you're curious about. They also sell their cookie dough, ice cream sandwiches, pies and tons of other goodies right there. When I indulge here I never feel that heavy lactose intolerant feeling. I almost don't even feel guilty (Danger, Danger!.) It's light and delicate and creamy and well... so yummy. Get some and bring me a scoop too!

Nice selection of flavors you will not find a 31 flavors. They even had soy ice cream (a good thing for us who are intolerant of lactose). Even with a single scoop you get two flavor selections, which is perfect for those who cannot decide. Just be prepared for a long line. It took us about 20 minutes on a Saturday evening.

Wow, this is truly an amazing ice cream  place! Before Bi-Rite I though Holy Gelato (in the Sunset) was the best ice cream in the City. I would now have to say, Bi-Rite has taken the cake, or... taken the cone. I had the sinker doodle ice cream, full of flavor and delicious. While there is limited seating inside, there are benches outside. I ventured over to Mission Dolores Park with my friends on an usually warm winter Saturday. Great way to spend an afternoon!!! PS... grab a punch card at the register and ask them to punch it. You'll be back,.... very soon. PPS... .Don't be scared of the line way the heck out the door. This is good stuff and WELL worth the long line. Don't fret, they move pretty fast in there.

Seriously. as good as it gets. my friend took me to mitchell's a month ago, and we waited 45 minutes for me to try a fairly mediocre to decent ube ice cream. i mentioned bi-rite to him, and he told me always passed it on his bike but never got a chance to try it. we showed up at 1030 on a saturday night, waited for maybe 10-15 minutes, and got to sample all the flavors we wanted to try despite the semi long line that was behind us. i settled on the salted caramel and my friend the roasted banana on two cones. i'm not the biggest fan of ice cream and am much more of a fan of sorbet and fruity flavors, but the salted caramel was AMAZING. it was the best ice cream i have ever had in my entire life. i'm normally turned off by caramel for fear it might be too sweet, but this was amazing. it wasn't too sweet and completely flavorful. the only thing that wasn't so desirable was the hole in the bottom of my cone. i tried a bite of the roasted banana and it was also incredible! i was blown away. i've had fantasies of the salted caramel since trying it. if you're ever in the city, you must go. it is definitely worth the minimal wait!

Have you ever had their s'more pie? They're in the to-go freezer to the left of the main ice cream case. Graham cracker crust, gooey caramel (a surprise!), chocolate ice cream, topped with marshmallow meringue-y-textured topping = to-go dessert heaven!!! And yes, the ice cream is fabulous. But the first 1300 or so yelpers already told you that. Now go try the pie!

For some reason, the constant crowd actually makes this place better. There is always a line and the inside is pretty small. The ice cream is so good that most people just stand around outside eating on the sidewalk. The overall experience is very intimate. It kind of reminds me of lunch during high school. Even if you aren't talking to these people, they are still right by you and you have a lot in common...like a nice cup of salted caramel ice cream. This place is an experience and I would recommend going when you aren't in a hurry and when you have a couple friends to chat with while in line, but I would recommend going.

I can't believe that I just discovered Bi-Rite even though I was born and raised in San Francisco. But maybe its better that I didn't find it sooner-I'd probably be about 500 pounds. The salted caramel ice cream is delicious, but I am really in love with their roasted banana ice cream. I love it so much that I want to be alone with it. And as if producing world class yummy deliciousness weren't enough, Bi-Rite is also a socially responsible business that gives back to the community. They are a long time participant in Dine for a Change, a fundraiser benefitting San Francisco Women Against Rape (the primary provider of rape crisis services and sexual violence prevention education programs in the city). Go here on June 4th and support a business that supports our community!

I've never gone here when there's a line and I never get the salted caramel, and I don't like unique flavors in general for ice cream.  I'll usually keep it close to vanilla with the flavors, and this place is money in the bank.  In general, their basic flavors are really good and there's variety for people who are more adventurous.  I also like their cookies that they sell. If you want to take it to the next level, go for the ice cream sandwiches...or better yet, buy a bag of cookies, a pint of ice cream and engorge.  My experience is a little skewed because I've only experienced good parking situations, no lines and really sunny afternoons.  It's far from it, but as close to Diddiy Riese as it'll get for SF. If it's a sunny day (like today) and there's parking because people are at work, head on over to Bi-rite and grab yourself an ice-cream sandwich (I like the Snickerdoodle cookies with Cinnamon ice cream).  Nothing feels better than walking around, eating an ice-cream sandwich and people watching on a great weekday afternoon.

Oh man, I wish this place were in So-Cal.  Ice creams had by me and the fam: Salted Caramel Toasted Coconut Balsamic Strawberry Creme Fraiche Some flavor with beer in it All of the flavors were FANTASTIC.  Even the beer flavor!

wow. this place is the best! Even with the line wrapping around the street corner, it's ok! well worth the wait. I can seriously come here on a daily basis! I always get the double scoops, but I might start doing TRIPLE scoops! So far, I tried balsamic strawberry, brown sugar with toffee and caramel swirl, coffee toffee, and toasted coconut. I also try a bit of the honey lavender from my bf, and it tastes good but a bit weird. Especially since my lotion scent is lavender. Right when I took the first sample of it, I felt like I was eating my lotion.  The salted caramel, name sounds weird, but it taste really good!! Every flavor I tried, I love. I also got a pint of coffee toffee to bring home, but my boyfriend is fighting over it with me, SO I will need to buy more to bring home. If it was a bit cheaper, I think I will definitely buy each flavor to bring home because i am THAT crazy over bi-rite!

Despite the below 60 degree weather, we still waited in line to get some ice cream from Bi-Rite.  The line is a sign of how popular this place is.   They have a list of unusual flavors -- I tried the honey lavender and almond cherry.  The ice cream is creamy and deeply flavored.  My friends tell me that in warm weather, the line wraps around the block!  There are benches around the trees in front of the stores for people to enjoy their ice cream.  You can also buy pints of your favorite flavors to bring home and I hear their sundaes are pretty darned good too. I recommend a visit to Bi-Rite if you're in the area!

It's the best ice cream in SF, although I wish it were denser and creamier like the best Wisconsin ice creams. Humprey Slocombe is a close second, with Mitchell's a distant third. Yes, it's well worth waiting in line for -- but please don't be that guy or girl who has to try and then deeply reflect upon each flavor before trying yet more flavors before finally ordering, because, yes, people in line behind you are in fact actually praying that you'll drop dead.

Just so happens a co worker had a birthday today and lucky me got to have their toasted pecan ice cream cake with a side of salted caramel ice cream. HELL YEAH. Let me tell you, as a bride-to-be on a strict diet/workout routine, there is nothing that would prevent me from digging into this creamy deliciousness. The salted caramel ice cream was just ummmmm, as one coworker awkwardly put it in front of everyone, "it's like a little orgasm with every bite" (odd looks and silence follow)  While I wouldn't say that in front of my bosses, this shit is pretty fabulous. Even more without a wait.

I have been "hanging out", as the kids like to say, in the Mission for less than three months, and yet I am already on my second punch card here. To be fair though, I take all of my friends here and then steal their punches that they could put on their own cards. Hmmm, that's not really fair at all actually. But I digress... I personally have only had ice cream here six times. Okay, I guess that's a lot. Why must you tempt me with your out of this world, fantastically stupendous ice cream Bi-Rite? While I enjoyed the salted caramel, ricanelas and mint chip, I was putting off trying the coffee toffee, because I knew myself well enough to know that once I had that, it would be game over and I would never try another flavor again. I was right and I will now only be able to sample their other flavors on one of Bi-Rite's spoons (I love that they have real spoons rather than evil disposable ones) or mooch off the many other friends I intend to bring to this establishment.

The first time I came here was on a hot summer night and the line was ridiculously long so it made sense. Then I came back a couple times on some colder nights (typical SF weather) and the line was still long, and I ended up leaving because my friends didn't want to wait. This time I came on an afternoon hoping that there wouldn't be a line, but I was wrong. It took us about 10 mins so it wasn't too bad, and it's worth waiting. So far I've only tried 4 flavors (ginger, honey lavender, roasted banana, toasted coconut) and they're all very good. Ginger is my favorite at the moment, and I am ready to go back and try some other flavors really soon. (I would give a 5-star if the line wasn't always that long)

I'm not a huge ice cream fan but their ice cream is REALLY good!  I never crave ice cream but I did the other day and I actually went back and waited in line for it.   So far I've tried the salted caramel, coffee toffee, strawberry vinaigrette, butter pecan and creme fraiche.  I really like the creme fraiche and the butter pecan.  They're known for their salted caramel which is very tasty.  Although I suggest if you get it, you should order something lighter like the creme fraiche to balance it out since it's so flavorful.  I wasn't a huge fan of the strawberry vinaigrette but I don't usually like strawberry ice cream...a lot of people however do like that flavor. Even though the line is long, I would say it is worth the wait!  I'm definitely going back to try more of their flavors!

I went to Bi-Rite Creamery a couple of weeks ago! I've been meaning to go for a long time. I decided to go since I was with my sister and my cousin at Dolores Park at the time. I know Bi-Rite Creamery is usually pretty crowded, but there was no line when we went, which was awesome! The employees were really friendly too. I told the lady working behind the counter that it was our first time here. She was cool about the samples and she even complimented me about my baseball jersey! :) I ended up getting the salted caramel on a cone. It was delicious! The texture was nice and the taste was very subtle. I'll be back again. Thanks Bi-Rite! :)

Before coming, I saw an episode of "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" on the Food Network featuring Birite.  In the show, there was a mention of their famous chocolate ice cream with olive oil, and I knew I had to try it before leaving San Francisco. I visited this place on a sunny Sunday afternoon, and the line was along the wall and around the corner -- a definite good sign!  After 30 minutes and a bottle of water, I was finally inside!  I was not sure the exact name of the olive oil chocolate sundae, so I described it to one of the friendly and helpful staff.  "Sam's Sundae", he said with a chuckle, and served me the best sundae I have ever eaten. Here's the description of the sundae: "Chocolate ice cream with bergamot olive oil, maldon sea salt and whipped cream" The coldness of the ice cream quickly chills the olive oil and heightens its viscosity to create a perfect blend between the ice cream and the whipped cream.  The crunchy texture and the saltiness of the sea salt provides the perfect contrast which accentuates the creaminess and sweetness of the sundae.  It's a perfect balance on multiple levels.

My boyfriend and I just recently discovered this little gem. We were a bit skeptical at first, considering their strange flavors, but they got such good reviews on Yelp that we had to try for ourselves. Everyone is right. It is always packed. The lines are always long. The parking is terrible. BUT worth all the trouble. Their flavors are ingenious! Very creamy and tasty. My bf had the salted caramel, which I believed to be a little too salty/rich, but I'm not much of a caramel fan to begin with, so I feel a little biased. I got the roasted banana... It was AMAZING. The service/staff is great. Super friendly, waiting for questions or to give you samples. Bi-Rite should be on every one's "To-Do"  list. It is most definitely worth all the trouble. We're definitely coming again.

Probably one of the best ice cream places you are going to find in the Mission District. If you are heading down by Dolores park and you wonder what that long line is for outside the store, it's Bi-Rite icecream! I happen to get the caramel-brown sugar swirl with mint chip and it was well worth the $3.25 for the two scoop ice cream. The service is nice and you really do get in and out quickly despite the deceiving long line!

Expectations were high when we went to Bi-Rite. Unfortunately we were disappointed. We loved the flavors we tried (lavender honey and coffee something or other). Bi-Rite's ice cream is fluffy- you can tell immediately when you hold it how light it is. If you like fluffy ice cream then you'll die for this stuff. If you are more inclined towards a denser and creamier ice cream you'll prefer Humphrey Slocombe.

I think they best thing about this place is the interesting flavors. Maybe that is why people are so ga ga over this place. Don't get me wrong, it is good, but it isn't THAT amazing. I've had the malted chocolotate something or other.... eh... not impressed. Salted Caramel.... not something I can eat a whole scoop of. Leaves me really thirsty. Balsalmic Strawberry.. probably my favorite so far. But again, nothing orgasmic. coffee toffee... not bad. Bold flavor, but again, left me really thirsty. I probably wouldn't have been back so many times if my room mate didn't want it so much! So again, i see why people like it so much but I'm just not huge fan. Gave an extra star for the creative mixtures and friendly staff.

After eating Bi-Rite ice cream, you can tell the difference between that and mass produced ice cream..it's NOT THE SAME! The parking around the area is not the greatest, especially on a warm day when everyone else and their mother wants ice cream, too. But it's definitely worth the wait!

I love ice cream and this is one of the best places I've been to. The lines are always out the door when we go. Even on the coldest day ever when the last thing on my mind is ice cream, I always see a line when I drive by. My favorite is the toasted coconut. So creamy and the coconut flavor is amazing. You can also find tiny bits of coconut mixed in which only makes the ice cream even more yummy. I've also had a taste of the roasted banana from my husband's cup and it's wonderful as well. Amazing banana flavor that you can't miss . I also tried my friend's earl grey (I didn't get it because I am not a fan of earl grey, the tea.) but it was actually good - maybe because it didn't taste like earl grey. All in all, I love this place and if it were cheaper and I wasn't going to get fat, I would come here everyday.

Bi-Rite Creamery is a definitely a "must" anytime I go to or drive by the Mission district in SF. Every time I come to Bi-Rite, I get the famous Salted Caramel Ice Cream and the Cinnamon Snickerdoodle ice cream. I haven't even dared to try anything else. The best thing about Bi-Rite is you can get a single cup of ice cream and split the scoop amongst 2 flavors. Thursday night, I half-way stepped outside my comfort zone and tried something different, the Roasted Banana ice cream and of course, the Salted Caramel. What a great combination! It tasted almost like eating a banana's foster. K got the Salted Caramel and the Brown Sugar ice cream. Both delicious as well. The ice cream is rather cheap at Bi-Rite, $3.25 for a single scoop. If ya'll haven't tried it, I suggest you get your butt down there now. You will be addicted!

I had wanted to try Bi-Rite Creamery for a while - and I recently saw it featured on the Food Network!   I got the Roasted Banana and Coffee Toffee.  DEE-LISH!! The banana flavor wasn't overpowering and definitely yummy, but OMG - the coffee toffee was amazing!!  My friend also got the Coffee Toffee, and the Earl Grey which was different from what we expected (yes, this "phatty" got a taste) but still good.

Compared to a steak dinner perhaps $8.99 a pint is cheap, but compared to Xanath its a bit pricey. That being said, its great ice cream and a decadent treat!

Personally, I was NOT a fan of the salted caramel despite the hype. It was ok, but there was better. In one day I visited this place twice because it was that good (and my friend lives a block away) I had the malted vanilla with peanut brittle, roasted banana, and cinnamon with snickerdoodle pieces. ALL WERE TO DIE FOR! This is authenic real as it gets ice cream and it's really great. It's like 2.25 for a 1 flavor kids scoop, 3.25 for a 2-3 flavor single scoop, and so on. I hear it gets super crowded and the lines go around the block! but it wasn't too bad when I went around 2pm (the first time) and 8pm (the second time) but keep in mind this is a cold Wednesday. MMM, I want some more!

My bf and I got the double size each.  We tried: Salted Caramel - I could live off of this for the rest of my life.  it was that good. Roasted Banana - great pairing with the salted caramel Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel - I love brown sugar!  the ginger added a surprising zing to the sweet and rich ice cream Cookies and Cream - you can never go wrong with this flavor. Honey Lavender - not a huge fan.  tasted like a spa. The line wasn't that bad at Bi-Rite.  I think we waited about 15 minutes?  The service was friendly too, letting us try lots of samples.  Can't wait to go back.  We took our ice cream to Dolores Park and enjoyed the sun.

Came here after having brunch at Boogaloos and wandering around and about in the Mission yesterday. When we got there, there was a massive line in front of Bi-Rite all the way up to the intersection. I've never seen such a line for ice cream before! But after having Bi-Rite ice cream, I now know why. I decided to get a single cone with salted caramel and malted vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate pieces (jeez, that was a mouthful, lol). Note to self: stick with a cup. I didn't realize how fast the ice cream would melt right after I got it! The ice cream melted so fast that it almost fell off my cone D: Usually, I wouldn't go as far as to try and save my ice cream, but I somehow caught the ice cream and plopped it back onto my cone :x Nevertheless, it was the most delicious ice cream I've had thus far, and that's saying a lot even with the ice cream dripping all over my fingers. Both flavors tasted heavenly, no joke. Earl Grey was pretty tasty as well; I think I might have to get that next time I go there alongside the soft serve. Extremely amazing ice cream plus excellent customer service (the person that helped me was super cute :D) is a win for me.

Mmmm....I LOVE their salted caramel ice cream. It's absolutely sublime!  Rich, creamy caramel with just a hint of salt on the finish - it was decadence and elegance in the same bite.   The roasted banana is my other favorite.   Do I think Bi-Rite is better than Mitchell's Ice Cream? It's a very tough call...Bi-Rite's flavors are more gourmet and unique, but I like Mitchell's just a tinsy bit more because their ice cream is creamier and has a more home-made feel to it. However, both places offer such a completely different variety of flavors that my recommendation would be to choose the place based on what type of flavor you're craving that day. You can't go wrong with either place!

I was brought to tears by the perfection of this place. No joke. I'm not even embarassed. Salted Caramel ice cream has ruined me! Once you have BiRite ice cream, you may never be able to eat ice cream from anywhere else. Be warned...

I love Bi-Rite. It's that simple, so delicious, so much different flavors and it tastes like home-made ice cream (because it is). I love the roasted banana ice cream. I always get a pint whenever I visit. The staff there is also friendly and you can also taste a sample of ALL the flavors. There are no limits, yeahhhh!

There's a reason why there's a line every time I come here. It's because the flavors are unique and delicious.  Some of these flavors are definitely flavors I would have never thought to be served as ice cream before. Some of my favorites that fulfill my sweet tooth: Salted Caramel- I didn't like this the first time I had it, but the second time I enjoyed it more, now I love it and I almost always want it. Roasted banana- Reminds me fried bananas with coconut ice cream. I love it! Early Grey- not too sweet. Who would have thought to make this into an ice cream flavor. It's not strong like the actual tea. But its very refreshing. Ricanelas (Cinnamon and snickerdoodle)- Another great flavor to get Pumpkin (seasonal)- get it while you can. It's popular and delicious. I love anything pumpkin flavored. I love coming here, but I hate waiting in the long lines. It's worth it though

Unclear why I've never heard of Bi-Rite or um, been to Dolores Park, but that must be an unfortunate side effect of keeping a primary residence in the Marina and failing to embrace this city's multiple neighborhood gems.  Such as Bi-Rite Creamery. Good thing a friend suggested we skip the overpriced desserts at Farina in favor of a pit stop for ice cream on the way home!  Salted caramel ice cream?  With a gracious drizzle of hot fudge?  I'm becoming more and more convinced that the best nights end with ice cream.  A little sweetness sure hits the spot.  Every time. We waited in line for about 10 minutes, during which I ran into a former co-worker!  I think seeing someone I knew enhanced the experience, making it feel like the corner ice cream place where friends reconnect. I can't comment on the quality of Bi-Rite versus other local ice cream places, but the excellent selection of flavors and service with a smile scored high enough to warrant enthusiastic endorsement.

I am an ice cream freak and this place is A+!!!!!  Got there, no lines, staff super friendly.  I got a cup of the salted caramel and it was everything I dreamed it would be.  Creamy, smooth...and the saltyness just brings out the caramel flavor even more....amazing.   I would like to come back and try "Sam's Sundae", that's next on the list!

Finally tried Bi-rite yesterday night! We had tried to get some of this infamous icecream the Friday night before but the line was out the door and around the corner so we had to take a raincheck. Now  I understand what the wait is for! I had the balsamic strawberry and cookies and cream, and my boyfriend had the salted caramel and malted vanilla with peanut butter brittle pieces. All four flavors were amazing but my favorite was the balsamic strawberry- the strawberry flavor was true to the fruit itself, which is so nice since sometimes strawberry flavored icecream butchers the real strawberry taste with too much sugar. This strawberry icecream was really natural and not too sweet. And for those who are worried about the combination of balsamic vinegar and strawberries, I assure you, you will not taste the balsamic. The salted caramel lived up to its reputation. The flavor was really interesting and complex- sweet and subtly salty. Definitely  try this place for great icecream! Expect a wait but the line does move quickly.

To most of the reviewers, I might just sound damn right crazy... Is there such a thing as ice cream being too sweet? I certainly do believe such a claim! I saw this creamery featured on one Food Network's show and HAD to try it while I was in town last weekend. I had the Coffee Toffee and the Brown Sugar with Caramelized Ginger. The coffee in the Coffee Toffee was over powering and slightly bitter, and there wasn't much toffee. The Brown Sugar was overly sweet which was a bit hard for me to swallow and could not taste the ginger either. I had a taste of the Mint Chip which I enjoyed because it tasted very natural and sweetened perfectly. I also tried the Honey Lavender which was prob a bad idea considering I don't like lavender much but it sounded interesting. I felt that the main flavors were just a bit too intense and overpowering instead of complimenting and balancing out the other flavors. I really wanted to love this place but I simply could not. One thing I really appreciate though is that it is organic and natural. Maybe my taste buds were off that day... I think I'd have to give it a second shot to finalize my opinion about Bi-Rite...

I was told constantly by people of how great this place is... and surprisingly those people were right. I went there for the first time a few days ago. It is located in a cute store with super friendly workers. It immediately made me like the place without even ordering yet. I eventually did order and got the brown sugar. Immediately it became my fav ice cream of all time.

Salted Caramel was really good, but the only problem is after the first few bites. It starts to become a little too sweet as you keep eating. I had to share my single scoop with a friend. The line isn't too long of a wait, but I'd say you definitely should try it if you haven't already.

This ice cream place is AMAZING!! I've never been so happy about ice cream. It's my favorite ice cream place now.   I had the honey lavender, brown sugar, and balsamic strawberry the last time I was there. It was awesome. :) They're eco friendly too. Everything is compostable. Parking is horrible, and the line is always long, but it is totally worth the hassle.

At risk of getting tarred and feathered, I just don't get all the love this place gets. While the ice cream is remarkably... well, creamy... that's about the only thing that stands out to me. I tried just about all of their flavors and simply was not impressed. Salted caramel tasted like caramel popcorn, balsamic strawberry tasted like regular strawberry, honey lavender was too sweet and overpowering, etc. I don't think the ice cream here sucks, it's just that I don't think it's *that* much better (if at all) than Mitchell's, Polly Ann's, or Joe's Ice Cream.

I am a HUGE ice cream fan, and this place is awesome. The ice cream is so deliciously creamy, it's hard to resist. Favorite flavors: Salted Caramel (although it should be burnt caramel) Honey Lavender (VERY lavendar and for some reason, I LOVE it) Brown Butter Pecan Line is long on the weekend afternoons, but totally worth the wait.

Chocolate, Caramel, and similar related fans will love BRC for their creative concoctions. As a matter of fact the majority of  their menu items revolves around chocolate and the like. Rich, delicious, and oh so naturally made. But I won't be returning on a regular basis, not because of the quality of the product, or because of the customer service, but because I prefer fruity icecream flavors aka "Mitchell's Ice Cream" on 29th St/San Jose. And the prices are set on "gourmet", so it's difficult for me to justify buying here. Parking is near impossible, so walk/bike/bus or use a friend with a car for a "drive-by". This is no way a negative review----just not my bag, baby.

Okay.  I am ashamed to say that even though I'm born and raised in the SCO it took me until recently to finally get my butt over to this place.  It's almost that effect where I know I COULD go whenever I wanted so there wasn't really much of a hurry.  Well after finally being fed up with my touristy friends born and raised in towns I don't even care to remember talking about this place I finally hauled myself here. Is this the best ice cream in the world?  Probably not.  Is it the most affordable price?  Dude, it's in the city.. I doubt it....  BUT... was the ice cream made with natural ingredients, with friendly service, and satisfy my taste buds?  Yup.  I went here after a full meal at Ike's Place and had the Balsamic Strawberry and Honey Lavender.  Now you may think that this is a weird combination but I found that the smooth taste of the strawberry toned out what could be a slightly overbearing taste of the honey and lavender if you're not used to such flavors. I wish I had the time or the balls to jump the counter, hold the staff hostage, while I grabbed multiple spoons to try all the flavors before the cops came but other things came about.  One day... A boy can dream. If you got the time then swing by and enjoy your ice cream at Dolores Park across the street enjoying San Francisco's beautiful foggy summers (which with global warming is far and few lately - I mean REAL SF summer weather, not what you outsiders consider cold... psh...).  If you're in a rush just stop by their side window and grab a prepacked pint.  Otherwise you go to your Cold Stone Creamers or Baskin Robbins and watch those idiots dance and sing for their quarter tip.

The line was just about to turn the corner when my family and I got into line.  Note, this was at about 9:30pm on a Monday.  And it was worth the wait!! I had the salted caramel, and did it live up to the hype.  It tasted like the caramel my family makes at home, just in ice cream form.  The saltiness was just enough.  Everyone else was very satisfied with there 2 scoops of ice cream: vanilla with peanut brittle, ricanelas (cinnimon with snickerdoodles), toasted coconut, apricot sorbet, and more.  I cant remember the others.   And the price isn't bad at all.  Five people with 1-2 scoops on a cone, came out to $15.  I will definitely be back to try the other more adventurous flavors.  The staff is super friendly and patient with those still deciding what to get.  By the way, scoops are pretty generous.

couple of works. Different, amazing, small, cheap. of all the regular flavors that the ice cream world has they only have 2 chocolate and vanilla. we had a sundae with cinnamon ice cream with snicker doodles mix in and the other flavor we had was vanilla with some toffee mixed in. it was very good sundae and reasonably priced.

Salted caramel is my all-time favorite. I've been here several times and have tried different flavors, but still prefer the salted caramel. :) I went here yesterday and saw that they kind of changed the layout? I'm not really sure, maybe I just haven't been here during the day time. Haha. Anyways, there is always a line for ice cream... luckily when my friend and I were passing by, we managed to just walk in and get ice cream. As we were paying to leave, we saw the line pile out the door. Whew! We were extremely lucky! :) However, this is not often the case, but I say it's still worth the wait. Always loved this place and will go back whenever I'm around Dolores!

After spending the afternoon in Dolores Park, my friends from the East Bay brought up the fact that thy had heard about Bi-Rite.  So even after eating all afternoon, off to wait in line we went.  And what a good decision that was. Even around 6 pm, there was a line, not yet around the corner.  Of course the business is ready with those line thingys from Disneyland and the airport.  After the wait, the buzz about the unique flavors got us chatting about what to try.   Although rather safe, I had the white chocolate with blackberry which was very creamy with enough tart from the fruit.  My friends were a little more exotic with lavender and salted caramel which were much better than I thought they'd be.   After hyping it for so long, definitely would go back for gourmet ice cream with a fantastic cone and a reasonable price.  I am more of a fan of Bi-Rite than ICI in Berkeley.  The flavors are more interesting and the vibe is nicer.  Available seating always helps.

I came here upon a recommendation from a friend since I've already tried Polly Ann's and Mitchell's. There was a line but it wasn't too bad. They move efficiently which I like. It's kind of a hidden place on a side street but you can always tell where it is by the line. I ended up getting the honey lavender and the creme fraiche that day. Both were very good. The creme fraiche wasn't overly sweet and had sort of a cream cheese taste too it which was unique but not too strong. The honey lavender was my favorite. It had that hint of lavender but was sweet overall. I can see why this place gets good reviews and can agree with most of the Yelpers here. The people were friendly and patient as they waited for you to decide what you wanted. I can't give this place 5 stars because my ice cream melted really fast. My friend's was immediately dripping off his cone but he was eating it as fast as he could which made him unable to enjoy it as much. Also, the flavors are good and unique but nothing out of the ordinary to me. If they were closer together, I would pick Ici (in Berkeley) over Bi-Rite. Still, not a bad place for new flavors and quality service.

Dear Bi-Rite, WHY MUST YOU BE SO FAR FROM ME?!?! I am a HUGE fan of soft serve ice cream, and recently popped in for the salted caramel version Bi-Rite was serving up... freaking delicious! I've seriously contemplated just hopping across the bridge at random hours just to go get another cone with some of their soft serve. I guess the distance works for me as well, because if I lived in the city I'd probably be here 4-5 times a week, thus obliterating my diet. Definitely some of the best soft serve I've ever had.

School's about to start for me, and I had to check this off on my summer to-do list. Check! The line wasn't terribly long, I waited for about five minutes? Not too bad  at all, in comparison to my five-hour wait in line on the last day of Ike's.. oh lord. When I got to the counter, I wanted to taste the balsamic strawberry because the name sounded so appealing, plus, who doesn't like strawberries? It wasn't anything out of the ordinary. I decided to go with salted caramel and honey lavender, just because these flavors don't appear frequently on other shop's menus. It was pretty worth it for two scoops at $3.25! The salted caramel tasted exactly like the top of a creme brulee - a caramelized, burnt flavor. Definitely should try this flavor for all you creme brulee lovers (me!) The honey lavender was like some aromatherapy-esque flavor. Yes, weird, unique, but I still liked it. It uncannily smells like hand lotion, or hand soap. I mean hey, if you ever wanted to eat your lotion or soap, here's the edible form for that! One star off, sadly, because the ice-cream was not kept at a temperature ice-cream should be kept at. It was already starting to melt, and it was not hot today.. (when was it ever hot in SF, anyway?)

I love ice cream, and Bi-Rite is some of THE best ice cream I've ever had! I tried the salted caramel, which was great, but I actually liked the brown sugar caramel better. I also had the balsamic strawberry, which was good, even though I'm not really into strawberry ice cream. I would definitely recommend this place, and I'm for sure coming back to try their other flavors. Btw, I like how there are a set amount of flavors so you're not TOO overwhelmed by the variety. I think they put a lot of thought into which flavors they make, and that's definitely a plus!

We went 2 times during our brief 3 day stay in SF, because it was SO good!  There is no lack of good food in SF, so the fact that we had to leave a wedding early and I ran 5 blocks in one direction and 3 blocks another in 5 inch heels should tell you how good it is.  ALWAYS a line out the door, even at 10PM on Sunday night!

This review is about as redundant as it gets.  My favs are the salted caramel and the coffee toffee.  Also love the malted vanilla, and the vegan chocolate-coconut is the best vegan product I've ever sampled.   The soft serve is pretty damn good for soft serve but it still doesn't hold a candle to the original stuff.  Sometimes the line really is just too long, but unless it's snaking its way all around the block it's totally worth it. Their ice-cream cakes are great for occasions, too. See you soon, BiRite...

I'm not much of an icecream-doer, but I love the fact that they have very UNIQUE flavors. I sampled their salted caramel, honey lavender, etc. But we ended up walking away with the roasted banana, and white chocolate raspberry with toffee crumbles. I shouldn't have chosen that as the topping, but it was still good! I was thinking of walking away with a small carton, but decided not to. Otherwise, it would have been gone within a week or two!

This was my first time at Bi-Rite! I normally see a million people lining up outside this place, but on a lucky Thursday, an adventure buddy and I got there with just a couple people ahead of us. The workers there greeted us with smiles and was more than happy to let us try almost all their flavors with their metal spoons! How environmentally friendly! I first tried the eggnogg for the first time, and she warned me beforehand that there was alcohol in there, it was actually not bad! I ended up sticking with a single salted caramel and candy cane ice cream. YUMMM!! Soo worth the money and the wait!

So, it's crowded. But it's good!! The line wasn't too bad, I tried like 5 flavors and decided to settle on brown sugar ginger swirl! it was sooo good. Usually when something is so good I'm happy and I go crazy. But I had to control myself to be extra disciplined so I wouldn't do anything rash and stupid and drop my icecream on accident. 1. I don't really like ice cream, honestly 2. I don't like ginger, at all. not the taste, not the smell, it's just repulsive! but. I loved the ice cream here, loved the ginger here. mmm. delish the carry-home cartons were a bit pricey though =(

Bi-Rite Creamery's unique, exotic flavors and textured ice cream is the perfect pitstop after a meal in the Mission for a cheap and satisfying dessert. With flavors like honey lavender, brown sugar (with a caramel ginger swirl), orange cardamom, and earl grey, you won't be disappointed with the selection. Flavors like toasted coconut manage to taste like the real thing, even adding texture with small flecks of coconut throughout, instead of tasting like some cheap, cloying imitation flavor. The service is friendly, the ice cream delicious. My only complaint is the ridiculously long line (I waited more than 30 minutes the other day) - which only goes to show its popularity and excellence !

Very simply, good flavors, HORRIBLE access and wait! If you're not driving in to this place it's a good little gem, but street parking is almost non existent! People compare this to Mitchell's and i would say that's fair, however, some noticeable differences (not that I'm telling you which one is better, but to distinguish between the two for the actual food. The Ice Cream here is deliciously flavored, but not as smooth (creamy) as Mitchell's. They do have some flavors that would bring me back here Vs. the other place, one being the Orange Cardamom. There used to be an Indian Ice Cream shop close to this area as well, but has since closed down, so now, to get a cardamom flavored ice cream, Bi-Rite is the place to go! Sample all you can, the flavors truly are delicious, and don't forget to try the special concoction!

There's not much left to say other than yes, Bi-Rite lives up to the hype. My one tip is to get the salted caramel with another flavor - my fave pairing is the roasted banana.  Salted caramel by itself is a bit too much for me.

I am not a big fan of sweets or ice cream, but since my out of town friends were craving some, I took them to everybody's favorite in SF - Bi-Rite creamery. I had the salted caramel. It was pretty good. I like the fact that they have all these unusual flavors vs the regular ones. Definitely better than Baskin Robbins, Haggen Daz, or Ben and Jerry's... Shows you the extent of my history and ice cream :P

I've been here... 3 times now? 1st time: Balsamic Strawberry and Honey Lavender. I was sick and stuffy, and these were the only flavors I could actually TASTE in my condition. But boy, was it delicious! Ever since... BiRite has elevated my ice cream tastes. I can't settle for $1 RiteAid ice cream anymore! I have to admit that I like BiRite more than Ici in Berkeley. The seasonal flavors offered have so much depth! You can always find a flavor to match your mood. And they don't run out of flavors by nighttime (this always happened to me at Ici. sigh). Plus, the lines have always been really short the 3 times I've been now. On the pricey side for ice cream, but very reasonable for the creamy quality and deep well-crafted, balanced flavors. Always a worthwhile treat for meeting with old friends, hosting out-of-towners and just because. :)

Been here a few times, but never got the chance to write a review until now. The first time I came here and got the toffee coffee ice cream with salted caramel. They were both really good, except I had gone to bi-rite at night and the coffee ice cream kept me up until 5am. The coffee ice cream was basically grounded up espresso beans with chunks of toffee in it. I loved it, but I didn't love the fact that it kept me up for hours. Biggest mistake ever, but definitely should try it if you ever get the chance. Salted caramel i think is self explanatory. EVERYONE loves it.  Their pistachio and cookies and cream are also really good flavors.

No matter how many times I come to Bi-Rite and how many different samples I try (the spoon washer must hate me) I ALWAYS end up with the same flavors: Salted Caramel: There is an amazing depth of flavor. It's like I can taste each layer of buttery sweetness as they folded it into the ice cream. It's like climbing up a marble-inlaid stairwell at the hippest nightclub party in your mouth. Balsamic Strawberry: it SOUNDS weird, but it flavors compliment wonderfully. Strawberry sweet, a little tart - a perfect seesaw. Honeydew Sorbet (i think?): tastes like a beautiful, breezy, summer day.

Everyone that is from SF raves about this place! Now I see why... First off, the ice cream is always fresh and flavorful...each and every ice cream flavor tickles your taste buds in a different and unique way. My 2 personal favorites are the salted caramel and the malted vanilla. But most importantly, you have to try the Ricanela banana ice cream cake!! It is, most seriously, the best cake that I have ever had in my life. I guarantee that if you try this cake, you WILL fall in love with it. In fact, I'm starting to drool right now thinking about this cake. There is always a long line on the weekends, and parking is horrendous...but in the end, it is all worth it for that moment when your tongue soaks in some of that yummy ice cream flavor!!

Bi-Rite was DAMN good!  Although I still can't figure out the significance of the name of the place. Foodie meets ice cream locale.  Salted carmel was awesome.  Also, their take on the cookie sandwich was so refreshingly tasty.  Not too sweet, very flavorful, smooth, and rich. Next time, when I waltz in not right before they close, I'll try the earl grey and the blood orange. As a super yuppie, it is definitely worth going south of Market for this.

They have the best salted caramel ice cream I've ever tasted! I love how its soft and creamy compared to traditional ice cream. My other favorite flavor is the brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl! They also serve sundaes and floats. If you are a milkshake fan though, don't expect to get one here.

Yummy selections and hard to pick just one! All the flavors are pretty awesome. I love my ultimate favorite: salted caramel on a sugar cone. Isn't it everyone's? The best part it's right down the street from my favorite bakery, TARTINE. So, if you have a sweet tooth and you want a SF experience go to both.

YOU MUST GET THE SALTY CARAMEL! It is so delicious! I also got Coffee Toffee which was pretty good as well. The little pieces of toffee is fun and adds an interesting texture and a nice crunch. What I like about Bi-Rite is that the flavors are so unique that you probably won't find them anywhere else. Because of this, I'm really looking for the next time I come back. I heard/read that blood orange is really, really good, so I plan on getting that next!

After hearing much ranting and raving about Bi-Rite, I decided to finally try it.  WOW! The ice cream was amazing and will definitely pay many more visits here!!!   SALTED CARAMEL wins first prize! (well for now, until I try more flavors) It was the perfect amount of sweet and salty combined.  And the texture was wonderfully smooth and had just the right amount of creaminess.  After finishing my scoop, I went back and purchased a pint for $8, pricey, but all worth it! After waiting in the long, expected line, it was finally my turn.  Although the wait was not so bad, as it was my first time and needed that time to decide upon the numerous, unique flavors.  The workers were very nice as i asked to try more than two samples!  If i could, I would have tried a mini spoonful of all flavors!   Flavors I sampled:   -Honey Lavender (pretty good, would buy a pint) -Roasted Banana (not what I expected, maybe it needed more banana flavor) -Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl (was good, but wanted more brown sugar flavor than ginger) -Malted Vanilla (wins the pretty good award) It is a plus that Bi-Rite uses natural, organic ingredients as well as the metal spoons for samples, instead of creating more trash with plastic.   Always fun, is the unique variety of flavors offered.  I already know what I am going to try next- Earl Grey, Orange Cardamom and Mint Chip just to name a few.   Overall, it was a great experience.  Only thing is the line and lack of space to eat the ice cream.  There were some seats, but all filled and had to squish in with other visitors.  I wish the seating area looked more like a "cute ice cream shop" where I can sit and enjoy my treat.  Also, the parking is horrible!  I had to be dropped off to enjoy the ice cream myself!   Besides these downsides, Bi-Rite deserves 5 stars for its product!

The flavours here are so unique and definitely worth trying. Salted caramel, brown sugar caramel ginger swirl are my favorites. The honey lavender is also great. I like getting a sundae with their housemade almond toffee and whipped cream. It is SO good. I tried their sam's sundae and preferred to make my own. The olive oil was something i had to try once but not something i would choose over the other delicious flavors and toppings they had.

Yes, some good stuff but price is a bit on the high side.  Last thing I had was the Mexican Chocolate.  Too many peanuts.   If you like salted carmel this is the place for you!   Lines around the corner after a day in Dolores Park.  Parking is next to impossible. Maybe I can't tell the difference so I'm happy with Haagen Daz and Ben and Jerrys, or maybe go to a mall and get Coldstones, or that gelato concession at Westfields.

Now, we all all know that parking in SF is a miserable ordeal in itself, and no one likes waiting in long lines, BUT Bi Rite's ice cream is totally worth it. The flavors are just extraordinary.  I ordered the coffee toffee and salted caramel and was blown away.  The flavors are complex, not overly sugary, and really taste true to their names.  My friend had the banana and Earl Grey ice creams, so I got to taste those as well.  Earl Grey was a stand out for sure.  It tasted just how I like my tea!  Rich and creamy with the bergamot essence really coming through. Delicious!

Obviously, with thousands of reviews, I don't have much to add.  All I can say is, go here, try their ice cream, and keep going back for more just like I do.  I don't even care that the line is long as frekin' heck; it's well worth the wait.

Oh god... how I miss living in the city... for missing these treasured places like Bi-Rite. Ever see a line that looks a mile long and you have flashbacks to Disneyland lines without FastPass... AND you still get so excited and anxious.. welcome to Bi-Rite Creamery. Depending on the time you go there, most likely, you can expect a line... and trust me you will probably go there with your ice cream cravings when most other people have them as well. The first time I heard about this place, my husband and I were just living in the city--- and I was about 1.5 months pregnant and I was craving something creamy and sooo good. Well! my baby boy and I were sure happy... or least I would like to think he was sharing in this experience and my guilty of stuffing my face with good good ice cream was eased. So lets get to the REAL scoop- the ice cream. My favorite (as most other reviews will state here)- SALTED CARAMEL! There is just something sooo right about this flavor. I have always love chocolate covered caramels with sea salt on top.. but honestly, you wont even miss the chocolate in this ice cream. It is smooth, creamy and the balance of caramel with that hint of salt is perfection at its finest. My husband needing to fare out tried their Balsamic Strawberry and let me tell you, it was pretty awesome. Others that people have claimed to be good- Roasted Banana and Honey Lavendar. YUM! The line can be a bit long but it goes by fast and you won't regret it. One thing to note-- Parking is a bitch in this area. Avoid if you can, spare the earth and walk there from your closest public transport. So, if you want to indulge and have no regrets about it, then Bi-Rite is the place to go!

Being unemployed has advantages: like breezing right in here on a Monday afternoon rather than waiting behind every young white person in the Mission during the weekend... The salted caramel is fine, though I wouldn't wait an hour for it. Get the malted vanilla with toffee chunks- thats  the real star of the show.

I've been meaning to write an update for a while now, but Earl Grey pushed me over the edge. Have you tried it? If you haven't, it would be in your best interest to do so. The bliss that ensues is an experience like no other. This is the hook, line, and sinker - if you hadn't gotten addicted to this place before, the Early Grey ice cream is what'll do it. Either that or their amazing homemade hot chocolate. YUM. I'm still a huge fan of the Vegan chocolate coconut. Just can't give it up. Also, huge boost in the greatness of the customer service, despite huge lines and holiday season. There's this one fella, I'm sure you'll see him one day, who has the most sincere face. He smiles all the time, and I love the way he scoops my ice cream. Even when I'm cranky from a half hour of finding parking and fifteen minutes standing in line on a cold winter day/night, interacting with him always makes me feel a little better. I told him this to his face once, lol, and even though my friends agreed with me I think he might have thought we were really weird haha.

I've been eyeing Bi-Rite for a while ever since my sister and a good friend of mine raved about it. WHEW, it's not overhyped! The ice cream is handmade with natural ingredients and the unique flavors do not disappoint. I had a triple scoop with honey lavender, mint chip, and salted caramel. The honey lavender was definitely my favorite; the fragrant lavender pairs so nicely with the sweetness of the honey. The mint chip was by far one of the best I've ever had. The mint really comes through! And of course, their famous salted caramel is heavy yet more addicting with every spoonful. My only gripe, if any, would be that the ice cream is extremely rich and leaves a film of creaminess on the roof of my mouth, but hey, it's a small price to pay for such a treat!

I think it's crazy what San Francisco-ians do for food (standing for hours, tolerating cold weather, dropping serious dough, eating in cramped spaces, and tolerating rude attitudes).  Just an observation. First, how the heck do people get to this place?  Parking is non-existent in this area.  I had my friend park illegally while I ran into grab some ice cream.  One star off because of that. When we arrived, it was very busy.  I tried the famous salted caramel and earl grey tea.  Friend got the honey lavender.  The flavors are strong and leave a lasting impression.  The salted caramel is to die for!  Very delicious and creamy.  Earl grey tea...ehh, not my cup of tea but it was true to it's flavor.  The honey lavender reminded me too much of soap but my buddy enjoyed it.  I would come back for more.

Bi-Rite's regular ice cream is to die for -- i.e., worth waiting in a 30+ minute line wrapped around the block on a chilly evening -- so when they opened the soft serve window, I was skeptical -- because, really, what could be better than salted caramel ice cream? Well, I'll tell you: it's called SALTED CARAMEL SOFT SERVE. No words exist to describe the deliciousness of this stuff -- it's incredible on its own, but salted caramel + chocolate swirl = the best combination ever (who thought of this??). It's that good! Oh, and the other flavors are pretty great, too.

Not sure about the hype here.  The ice cream is okay, but I wouldn't do a double-take over it.  I enjoyed the bi-rite series that occupies this area (ice cream store, sweets shop, market), but the ice cream tasted just decent.  Staff is super friendly though, which is much appreciate.  Got the salted caramel and malted vanilla.  Malted vanilla was better than the salted caramel.  A fun spot to get your fix, but not something to seek out.

I don't have a sweet tooth but I love ice cream. The line here is always horrendously long on the weekends so I decided to go on a random weekday in the afternoon when there was no line. I heard the salted caramel is amazing and requested for a sample. But since I don't have a strong sweet tooth, I thought the salted caramel was a bit too sweet for me. I settled with a scoop of the honey lavender and a scoop of the cookies and cream. The combination was delicious. The honey lavender provided a very refreshing contrast to the more rich cookies and cream. The ice cream is delicious here, but I wouldn't say it's worth standing in line for more than an hour.

They have so many great flavors and constantly create new ones, that once you have been there the long line and even the price makes sense.

I finally see why there are 4000+ reviews of this place.  Sure, the salted caramel ice cream is really good, but it's not life changing or anything.  Then, a few weeks ago, I tried the smores pie.    I CANNOT stop thinking about it. Every day I brainstorm reasons to go buy one for myself.  I think the secret is the caramel layer between the crust and the ice cream.  I've been in Birite's general vicinity and I've actually done drive-bys like a crazy stalker ex-girlfriend trying to find an excuse to go say hi.  It's that good, and a possibly unhealthy obsession.

Lines are a given, just give it 5-10 its worth it! Got the Small size with two flavors in a cup but TIPS: 1. ask for the cone on top, best of both worlds at no extra charge! 2. ask for samples they are more than willing to do so and give you metal spoons! a small thing but it saves on the waste and makes it memorable. 3. bring friends so you can steal some off them as well! Salted Carmel: they are famous for this for a reason, creamy, sweet, carmely but not overly sweet, creamy or heavy. Just satisfying. Honey Lavender: know that light, clean, fresh, relaxing, springesque, lavender smell you love so much? Yah now its in a delicious ice cream. Go get some. Early Grey: surprisingly flavorful, often tea flavors don't translate well into ice cream as either too subtle, muddled, or artificial but this gets it right. Definitely recommend at least a sample. Roasted Coconut: features actual bits of roasted coconut in the icecream it self. This is not the almond joy or typical shredded coconut many have come to recognize as the only form of coconut, rather has a more nutty crisp texture compared to the oily more chewy shredded form. Good but the least favorite of the four I tried.

Everything is amazing and so rich and yummy. They use real whipping cream and all the ice cream is handmade. I cant get enough. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is that it was pricey. $9.50 for a sunday with and extra scoop and they have a pretty long line. Thats ok. Im willing support small business like this.

Among the best ice cream places *anywhere*.   I used to live in Boston, which (with some merit) considered itself the ice cream capital of the US (Christina's, Toscanini's, Steve's, Herrell's, and other great purveyors were always competing for supremacy).   Bi-Rite is as good or better than anything you'll have in Boston. Daring flavor combinations and emphasis on organic/sustainable practices are big pluses.

Bi-Rite, how did I not know of your existence?  Especially when you're a mere 3 blocks from Imagiknit (aka Yarn Heaven)! We met up for dinner in the Mission just so we could go here afterwards.  The setup reminds me of Ici, but I really appreciate those U-shaped benches out front, and though crowded, there is a very small standing only space inside.  The flavors were a little less adventurous than Ici (I shouldn't compare so much, but I can't help it) but still delicious.  I went with Coffee Toffee and Cinnamon with Snickerdoodles...I'm still wishing I had at least sampled the Salted Caramel, but I'm sure I'll be back. Bi-rite wins on location: being next to one of my favorite SF parks, walkable from MUNI and BART, and just down the way from all of the treasures on Valencia St.  I see many happy Sundays spent hitting up all my favorites spots in this area and lounging in park with some ice cream.

LOVE THIS PLACE. I've been here twice. I think I got lavender my first time with something else. It was tasty. Yesterday I got Cookies n' Cream and Ricanelas (snickerdoodles and cinnamon). OH DEAR MY IT WAS FABULOUSLY DELICIOUS. It's always packed here, and the service is sometimes rude (there's a redhead there that was pretty impatient and not cool in helping customers), but you will not regret coming here.

Salted caramel ... how I love your sweetness. The line going out the door can be intimidating.  Hell, downright torture on those rare hot days in SF.  But, the salted caramel ice cream is totally worth it.   To try different flavors without the actual commitment, ask for a sample.  What you get is a generous spoonful of a sample on a REAL spoon.   Like a gelateria, your one scoop size ($3.25) comes with the option of 1 or 2 flavors.  When you're getting 2 flavors on a cone, it behooves you to plan ahead which flavor you want on the bottom.  I got honey lavender on top, salted caramel on the bottom.   Just 4 stools at a counter to enjoy your treat away from the foggy cold air.   Little benches encircle the trees outside.   If you go across the street to sit on the grass at Dolores Park, watch out for licky dogs sneaking up on you.

One of the best ice cream I ever had, thanks to a certain individual for showing me this place. Organic ice cream at its finest. Very unique flavors, which I have yet to try them all. I had the Salted Caramel and Balsamic Strawberry, they were different and at the same time interesting. I never had a salted ice cream of any sort and it blew my mind. Will definitely come back here on a hot sunny day. Unfortunately there are no table or seats which means you will have to enjoy your ice cream along Dolores Park, I guess I can't complain about that. UPDATE: Returned for another ice cream stop. 45 mins wait later ordered a scoop of Ginger and a scoop of Honey Lavender on a cone.  Ginger flavor not strong enough however still very creamy, also as I was biting into it there was a small piece of baking paper! Oh wells, it happens I still like the ice cream. Honey Lavender was better than the ginger, it has a subtle lavender flavor, not overpowering.

This is the best ice cream in the Bay. The creamery was hip and the employees were awesomely cool people. The guy gave us full-spoon samples which was differently appreciated. He mixed the most random ice cream together that tasted so uniquely delicious. Cookies 'n Cream with Mint Chip was my winner. Although, I will go back to get Salted Caramel which was oh-so-[expletive]-good!!! Happy dance was present as I enjoyed my small cup of this must-have ice cream. Next time, I'm going to get a gallon! Highly recommended. Two thumbs!

We picked up a coffee toffee ice cream cake here for my birthday. It was DELICIOUS. I highly recommend. Even those friends that are not big dessert fans raved about the cake. Quick tip--you can bypass the long line outside and pick up the cake quickly if you preorder. This place is great. However, I'm so glad that it's not in my neighborhood, since I'd probably weigh 300 pounds if it was.

I would give it 10 stars if I could, just for the chocolate, toasted coconut, and salted caramel.  The chocolate is just to-die-for, being deep and rich in its flavor, without too much milk or sugar to dilute it.  The toasted coconut is a nice complement to the chocolate, and the salted caramel had a wonderful combination of sweet with just a bit of salt to bring the other flavors out.   I've been absolutely thrilled with every flavor I've tried there -- in addition to the 3 above, I've tried the Mexican chocolate, malted vanilla, coffee toffee, and cookies and cream. Parking in the neighborhood totally sucks, but the ice cream makes it worth the trouble.  I've been lucky to get there at times when there's no line, but even when the line wraps down to the corner, it tends to move pretty quickly.  The servings are on the generous side, so be warned that if you get the 3 scoop size, you'll end up with close to a pint of ice cream.     Every time I find myself up in the city, I try to make it a point to stop here, even if it's out of the way.  Plus, it's organic, so it must be good for you... or at least that's how I justify it to myself.

New Review: Owners of Bi-Rite Ice Creamery are probably reading my review because the flavors are so awesome now!  I love the roasted banana and toasted butter pecan ice cream.  I'm still not a fan of the lavender ice cream, but that's my preference.   ______________ I live on the block of Bi-Rite Ice Creamery and there is ALWAYS a huge line on the weekends and after 7pm.  The location is great for an ice cream shop and I love that they are here, but the flavors ain't all that!   Okay, what's good about it?  Customer service is great!  The employees are nice and try to satisfy customers.  Although, one time my friend was given 2 totally different flavors she asked for.  The price of the ice cream is moderate and there are a variety of flavors to choose from.  The only flavor I like at Bi-Rite Ice creamery is the Balsamic Strawberry.   What's not great about Bi-Rite Ice Creamery? My least fav is the lavender ice cream--it tastes like lotion.  Other than that, everything is okay.  Good luck finding parking, drivers.  If you are walking or taking public transit, you're safe.  I'd prefer my all time favorite, Mitchell's Ice Cream.

Dude..seriously. The best homemade ice cream. After hearing raves about Bi-Rite, I went there last night to try it and slipped in just before they closed the doors. The staff is super friendly, except for the Mexican worker who was just in a hurry to close and didn't want to give me tastes of the flavors I wanted...I got the Chocolate Coconut with their homemade graham crackers--and it's seriously to die for.both the ice cream, and the graham crackers. The BF got the Malted vanilla and cookies and cream and those flavors were superrr tasty as well. Will definately come back to try the rest! Kudos to the staff with all your patience when people ask to try flavors! :)

One look at the ice cream flavors here and you realize this place is different. My fav...Orange Cardamom was absolutely delicious!  Also tried honey lavender, it was good but not as amazing.

I agree with the masses that the line is pretty redonkulous. Lucky for me, I live relatively close to said ice-creamery so I have the option not to wait in line.  Which is pretty much mid-day during the week or the crack o' dawn on weekends.   My fave?  The honey lavender!!  Outstanding.  Sounds like your grandma's potpourri but so not.  The lavender is mild, but not too mild that you can't taste it.  The honey adds a sort of sweetness to flavor that is not at all overwhelming.  And the texture is perfect.  Creamy, yet light at the same time.

Not impressed at all. Long lines, but thought it would be worth the wait.  For the real good stuff, I suggest getting a gelato in North Beach. Although the flavors here sound cool, they're much the same. All I tasted was frozen cream (as in ice-cream). It wasn't smooth or creamy and the flavor was an aside rather than part of the ice-cream. Had to try what everyone was talking about, but if I catch myself in this neighborhood again I will walk down the bloc to Tartine Bakery instead.

One of my friends was going on and on about how she's always wanted to try Bi-Rite but has never had the right people to wait in line with. A couple of us decided to pile up in the car and go check this place out. Now, I don't have any favorite flavors when it comes to ice cream; so I ended up getting one scoop of mint chip and the other, cookies n' cream. Close enough right? Anyway, I was thoroughly satisfied when I finished devouring it. So much that I ended up going back inside just buy a pint of cookies n' cream ($7.99, totally worth it). They use vegan-friendly ingredients too. I suggest you give it a try. Definitely made my summer day. :) PS - There's a rumor going around that Bi-Rite is gonna open up on Arguello. I'd love to see that happen, especially since I live in the Inner Richmond area.

I'm not a big fan of ice cream but can we make a new word to describe how delicious the flavors here are?  I now understand why the line forms here.  To be quite honest, I wasn't quite sure how to take the flavors.  But I felt adventurous so I chose the two that sounded the most insane.  I had salted caramel and honey lavender.  I have a big mouth and I talk a lot but those two scoops shut me up pretty good.  Not only did they taste amazingly good, they actually complimented each other quite well.   I tasted my friends' flavors too and all of them were just as good.  Of the flavors I tried, I think I had mint chip, some banana flavor, cookies and cream and brown butter pecan.  I don't know what type of magic goodness they put into their ice cream but it's got me hooked.  Why do I have to live in south bay? =(

Salted Caramel A Delicious Combination My Ice Cream Staple I have only lived in San Francisco for a few months but already I have visited this Bi-Rite at least 10 times! (doesn't help the Mission is such a happening spot!)  When it comes to Ice Cream, this place has the art down - turning all sorts of flavors into a delectable dessert.  I'm a fan of Salted Caramel (duh), Honey Lavender, Earl Gray (just like the tea!), and Coffee Toffee.

Mmmmmmm. Fairfax Scoop in Marin and this place are the two must have Ice Creams in the Bay Area! Earl Grey! Seriously. Unlike any ice cream I have ever had.  I am so glad I went against my initial instinct and tried the Earl Grey. Yum. So, you are probably going to take your ice cream outside to the park - because it is perfect out there.  Be warned - it will melt - because it is all natural. But don't worry - you can easily suck it down. If you live in the city - get one flavor and just keep going back to try all the variety - if you are visiting get at least two flavors!

After brunch we braved the rain to try this place. Heard such amazing things about it and really all i needed to hear was Salted Caramel ice cream. The rain was helpful to avoid the massive lines i ususally see outside the store.

I made my way up to San Francisco from San Jose with my girlfriend just to try Bi-Rite Creamery, due to its tremendous reputation. I arrived at Bi-Rite and i immediately noticed a long line stretching out to the sidewalk, but surprisingly i was ordering at the counter within 10 minutes. My girlfriend and I ordered the Salted Caramel, Banana Kiwi, And the Mint Ice cream.......  I was amazed of the different texture and taste that each of these flavors contain! The first flavor i tried was the Salted Caramel, and it had the gooey texture of caramel, but creamier. haha Then secondly i tried the banana kiwi ice cream. It tasted like fresh bananas and kiwis were just mushed to make this pulpy texture that feels almost as if you're eating the fruit fresh. But lastly, also my favorite, THE MINT!!!! The best mint ice cream i have ever tasted! I always love mint ice cream, and i tried many! None of them beats Bi-Rite's MINT ICE CREAM! haha I'm in love, and my girlfrind is too.... haha To sum it up, This place is amazing. I havent tried everything yet, but i told myself i have to try everything by the end of the month. Its just too good to resist. haha A must try! You'll have fun, guaranteed! =D

I will parrot a majority of the reviews here: Salted Caramel In my quest to impress picky eater friends, I shared different ice creams with them. They couldn't get enough and I was a local hero. On my first trip to Bi-Rite, I enjoyed the Browned Butter Pecan (oh SO good!) and the Ricanelas (who can resist cookies?!?!). This trip, I savored Salted Caramel (*drool) and the Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Chips (good, but not heart stoppingly great). While Fentons is a school kid's dream with their decadent, chunky flavors with traditional and fantastic toppings, Bi-Rite is ripe with fresh, sophisticated grown up flavors. Don't get me wrong, my kid would love this place, but it's a great place to take friends after a dinner in the City!

Who knew diabetes could taste so damn good? When I come to Bi-Rite Creamery I usually stuff my face with as much honey lavender as my sensitive stomach can handle. But when I came here two days ago, I thought I would expand my horizons and opt for salted caramel and coffee toffee instead of my usual.   Salted Caramel - delicious blend of salty and sweet Coffee Toffee - can't go wrong with toffee nuggets embedded in your ice cream After filling myself with cream (ice cream) at Bi-Rite,  I waddled over to Anthony's cookies for more mouth-gasms. And by waddle I mean I drove my fatass and found the closest possible parking so I wouldn't have to walk more than 3 feet to the store entrance.

When my SF-local friend kept recommending me this "salty" ice cream, I didn't understand how it could taste good. Yes, it does taste funky and unique in its own way, but it is delicious and thus worth a try - when you feel most patient for the line that continues down the block, that is.

I'm so glad they had a menu posted outside their store ---way to get you excited and eager like a little kid waiting outside an ice cream store! I ordered a single scoop (you can choose 1-2 flavors) and of course the piggy I am, I got two flavors.

The flavors are true to its name, super creamy, and melt-in-your mouth YUM. Good thing, D ordered two different flavors from me, because I got to try 4 flavors and not just two!

Great ice cream, great variety and great service. This place always has great flavors and ideas for sundaes to choose from.  And if you've tried them all, then try mixing up your own sundae and see if you can create your own crack-type addictive combination. It's really not that hard when you start off with great ice cream.  Their salted caramel is the obvious star of the bunch... but when that gets too sweet you can switch off to roasted banana or coffee ice cream.  If you're not an ice cream person (I don't see any reason not to be) you can grab popsicles.  The popsicle flavors are seasonal and are usually on point anytime of the day/night.  Go... GO NOW!

I've been thinking whether to give this 4 or 5 stars.  I decided to go with 4, but by all means, plenty of others might disagree with me. The SALTED CARAMEL is absolutely amazing.  It may seem like a weird flavor just by listening to it, but it is one of the best.  The people that work there said SALTED CARAMEL SELLS 3 TIMES MORE THAN ALL THE OTHER FLAVORS.  A must have there! And all the others flavors are fantastic as well....go try them!  they are really friendly and lets you try all the flavors if you REALLY want.  Gogogo!!!

The ice cream here is spun fresh daily.  I was able to have the Balsamic Strawberry and Roasted Banana.  The Roasted Banana was my absolute favorite as I love anything banana flavored.   I also got to try Salted Caramel and Brown Butter Pecan.  The Brown Butter Pecan was another great flavor that was extremely delicious. My sister had the Mint Chip and Ricanelas (which is Cinnamon with Snickerdoodles).  The Ricanelas was good but had too much of a cinnamon flavor for me.  If you love cinnamon, you would love it. There is a line but definitely well worth the wait!!

I have never, ever been disappointed by Bi-Rite Creamery. Actually, I think I fall in love with it more and more each time I go. Honey lavender, earl grey, salted caramel, balsamic strawberry, brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl...oh lord absolutely THE best ice cream I've ever had. Super flavorful and unique, but not overly creamy or heavy tasting. They give you pretty hearty spoonfuls when you want to taste the different flavors, which is a huge plus in my book. They recently expanded the ice cream shop to include more seating - but that doesn't necessarily mean that you'll find a seat inside. I feel like SF people eat ice cream in any kind of weather, so expect a line (sometimes to the end of the block) even when it's marginally sunny out. But no worries, it generally moves pretty quickly and it's SO WORTH IT.

Took the J-Church and walked up a block to Bi-Rite for a little fantastic ice cream. Flavor did not disappoint.  I had a triple with mint chip, cookies and cream, and malted vanilla with peanut brittle.  The ice cream is first rate and the flavors are simply outstanding.  That has not changed. What has changed are the servings.  Very noticeable reduction in how much a serving consists of.  A single serving isn't even the since of a standard ice cream scoop.  It's more of a baby scooper that makes a triple seem more like 1 1/2 regular servings.  In the end it made me question the price for what I got out of it.  I felt a little screwed, which isn't a good thing. Will I come back?  Of course.  The ice cream is still excellent.  But I'm not going out of the way to spend the same amount of money for less.

Not sure what compelled me to buy a bunch of ice cream sandwiches since I generally don't like them.  Cookies tend to be hard as a rock and not very fresh.   Here's what I bought: Sugar cookies with balsamic strawberry ice cream: Sounds weird and disgusting, but I really like it.  Strawberry has never been my favorite flavor and still isn't, but I'll eat this any day.  It wasn't too sweet and had a nice subtle tartness to it.  Paired nicely with the sugar cookies.   Chocolate chip cookies with vanilla ice cream: If you're boring and unadventurous, you'll enjoy this.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but too plain and ordinary for me. Dark chocolate cookies with mint chip ice cream:  One of my favorite ice cream flavors and who can resist dark chocolate cookies?  I've had better mint chip ice cream though. Orchid watermelon popsicle: Sounds exotic, but not worth the money or time.  Didn't taste the orchid (not really sure what orchid is supposed to taste like) and the watermelon flavor was faint.  I could have made this myself using watermelon juice and an ice tray. I was impressed with the ice cream sandwiches.  The cookies weren't hard but chewy even after being in my freezer for a day.  Didn't have to wait for them to thaw out a bit before enjoying.

Obviously this place shits on the rest! Such good ice cream. Such good quality fresh ingredients (local, organic produce/ingredients)! Totally worth the price and wait. The flavors are so creative (like honey lavender for example) and so yummy, it's kinda absurd how good it is. Ricanellas...if you don't try this signature, you're not livin' it. Snickerdoodle and cinnamon ice cream...amazing. My new fave is the malted vanilla with their fresh PEANUT BRITTLE - dank, chronic, delicious. One time they recommended a friend the roasted banana to pair with ricanellas and I thought roasted banana wouldn't be quite the business but WOW! Was I wrong...it tasted like a REAL banana! Not the generic, semi-banana flavors you get in like other ice creams and desserts. This was LEGIT. You gotta come here if you're in SF.

Salted Caramel was on my "must try" list. I was always wandering why people love it so much, until I tried. I got a small cone for $3.25. I chose two flavors-salted calamel and white chocolate raspberry swirl. The caramel was a perfect combination of sweet and salty. The white choc raspberry was a little sour, but mostly sweet. BiRite is a great place to go to on a warm day like this. You can go sit in the park and enjoy your ice cream. No wander this place is so popular! :]

This place is AMAZING! I have a pretty bad sweet tooth and after I had lunch at Ikes Place, I decided to walk over to try their ice cream. I love this place because they are very creative and inventive with their flavors... it not just vanilla and chocolate. If you are down to try new things .. this is the place! I had the salted caramel, roasted banana, and honey lavender. My favorite was the salted caramel because it has this sweet, salty, savory, distinct test to it that really makes your mouth orgasm. The texture is very smooth and leaves you craving the next bite.  The roasted banana has a very strong banana taste to it, thought it was also good, I do not prefer it over the salted caramel. My least favorite of the three was the honey lavender. I love the smell of lavender, the color, and the flowers -but in your mouth- not so much.   I'm determined to to try all the flavors at some point... They also sell them by the pint and quart so if you wanna take some home, you can!

So I loveeeeeeeeeeee ice cream, and am a bit snobbish about ice cream (I normally don't like American ice cream, and prefer Italian gelato).. but I loved Bi-Rite!! I tried so many flavors and all were delicious! I ended up choosing the coconut chocolate (vegan) - so yummy! Anyway, we were lucky because the line wasn't too bad when we went! So a plus for us!

Some of my fave flavors are the Salted Caramel, Balsamic Strawberry (and i don't even like Strawberry ice cream usually lol), and the Coffee Toffee. Yuuummm!   I always get my single scoop (two flavors) on a sugar cone and walk over to a nice patch of grass at dolores park and people-watch while enjoying this amazing ice cream!  The line sometimes is long if its a sunny day and parking sucks so ride your bike there or something!

I am a lover of the bent spoon in Princeton and if I were to tell you my other fave ice cream spot, it would be BiRite. Folks, this is a BIG FCKING DEAL. Great texture, solid flavors. I hate when you have to guess what you are eating or the contrary, when you are annihilated with flavor. BiRite's ice cream is definitely well-balanced. Their vegan ice creams however were bit of a disappointment, but I mean c'mon.... duh. Salted caramel was fantastic, pumpkin is yum, etc etc etc. I will never visit San Francisco without a visit to BiRite.

It says something when two irrational girls drive an hour to get to the City, take another 15 minutes to find parking, get their ice cream, then go home, without doing anything else in SF. And, when my guy friend and I missed our bus to get ice cream, then decided "ah, screw it" to miss the next one, so we can go back in and get another scoop (yes, we were incredibly late) It.is.that.good. I always make a pitstop when I'm in the city (with or without car). -Salted caramel: I swear, I hear trumpets and Hendel's "Messiah" or something. The saltiness adds a wonderful balance. -Balsamic Strawberry: I hate salad dressing, this does not taste like salad dressing, AT ALL. -Coffee Toffee: I see the coffee grinds, and the toffee chunks are wonderful. I always get this and Salted Caramel. -Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle: Peanut Brittle, omgggggg -Honey Lavender: actually, not so excited about this one. I forgot which sorbets my mom tried, but those were good too. COOKIES, also good. I still must try their soft serve...

Been here a half-dozen times, I really like this place.  You know its good when there is a line rain or shine out the door. I've only tried a few flavors and they have been pretty good.  I can really taste the strong lavender in the honey lavendar. If you like banana, I would totally recommend the roasted banana.  The banana flavor is there without being overwhelming.

Absolutely love the salted caramel!  I've tried this flavor elsewhere at Molly Moon's in Seattle and a local ice cream shop in Portland and it's the best at bi-rite.  It has just the right saltiness...not too overwhelming and doesn't leave you thirsty.   Expect to wait in line.  But if you know what flavor you want, visit the window with the baked goods to see if they're offering it.  That line moves quick.

Visited San Fran and as I was told Bi-Rite Creamery was the way to go. It was overcast when I visited, but in some strange way I am the type of person who enjoys ice cream more when its cold outside. Yes. I know, strange, indeed. When I asked for a free sample, they gave me a metal spoon from a jar of water. It sort of put me off a bit, not quite sure why. I guess I expected using a plastic spoon and have it thrown away. But, of course they were environmentally conscious as I saw they were separating their trash! A HUGE PLUS in my book. I wish more shops were like this. If I had one suggestion, it would be their most popular flavor- salted caramel- a little bit of sweet decadence with a touch of bitterness, sort of like a bacon topped doughnut I had tried before. It leaves you asking what the heck did I just eat?!?  But you find yourself continuing to eat it because you just can't stop. EXACTLY.

I do like the unique flavors at Bi-Rite.  My faves are the orange cardamon, lavender, and earl grey. However, I am not a fan of the texture of their ice cream.  I like my ice cream dense and creamy, like Haagen Dazs.  Bi-Rite is too fluffy.  All of the air molecules mixing in with the cream actually makes the ice cream seem less creamy.   A pint for $8 is just too steep for ice cream I am not in love with.

Have only tried four flavors so far -- Salted Caramel, Coffee Toffee, Earl Grey Tea, and Honey Lavender. Out the four, Salted Caramel is definitely the flavor packed one. It hits you right away, like you didn't expect it would so quickly. The Coffee Toffee is a bit bitter and carries more of the coffee flavor. Nonetheless, a flavor I'm likely to order again. Earl Grey Tea and Honey Lavender are both lighter in comparison to the other two I mentioned. The flavors are subtle, but definitely there. All in all, I loved all four. So, the ice cream at Bi-Rite is pretty good, but it's nothing I've never seen before around SF. Bi-Rite is in the very very busy Mission district. Parking is a literal nightmare. Last time, I came here I bought 3 different single scoops, for three different people. My boyfriend circled around the block like 7 time, looking for a parking space. And I came out of the store, juggling three freezing cups in my hands. I would have opted for cones, but I thought I'd have a harder time. It kind of killed my overall Bi-Rite experience, sad face. I really want to come here again, but maybe only on a weekday when hopefully, there's less parking issues!

Can't help but feel good when you get a slam dunk parking spot right in front on Bi-Rite. Then saw the line out the door and around the corner... Shucks! :( Got to give it to the crew there for moving the line at lightning speed since the wait was no longer than 5 minutes. Really, I felt I barely had enough time to decide on my flavors:) luckily they were cool with letting me sample, which helped the decision process. Ended up with a salted caramel (who could refuse???) and lemon meyer. Salted caramel got me weak in the knees. Almost enough to trade in my boyfriend for a lifetime supply of this oh soooo smooth, cool, salty, toffee tasting delectable cold confection. Ok, I'm kidding about the boyfriend trade, but it's definitely something to consider... Oh, almost forgot about the lemon meyer. It was a very refreshing flavor with a hint of ginger. Great palate cleanser if you just had a greasy meal. In fact, I think it might reverse the effects of greasy food and give you a chance at re-eating yournlast meal. Friend offered a taste of the honey lavender and it really just wasn't my cup of tea. Had the same flavor at Holy Gelato and it still feels like potpourri in my mouth.

Every time I come back this place just gets better and better. Lets hope it stays that way. The second time I had bi-rite, it was in October and I got the melon sorbet and honey lavender, both, which were splendid flavors for the hot Indian summer San Francisco receives every fall. Light, aromatic, and not too creamy, they were perfect. The third time I came was two weeks ago with my cousin. She was a bi-rite virgin so I brought her so she could become de-virginized. She immediately loved the flavor names and decided upon the honey lavender and chocolate, while I got the salted caramel and earl grey. I had the salted caramel and always love it each time I try it, however that night Mr. Earl Grey stole the show with his lovely aromatic and very close to tea taste. I LOVED every single bite of it and wished I had gotten more. Thank God it is only a bus ride away because now I won't have to fret!

Salted Caramel is always good. I tried this other flavor, I forgot what it was called, but it was cinnamon snickerdoodle with snickerdoodle chunks in it. BOMB! As I was leaving, I saw someone carry out a box of cupcakes with what looked like ice cream on top instead of frosting. I'm definitely going to try that next time.

I'm pretty sure there is crack in this ice cream because I crave it like an addict! First time I had this ice cream, a friend had brought it to a party and OMG! I am not a huge ice cream eater but I swear I could eat an entire pint of this in one sitting and still want more. I literally couldn't stop thinking about bi-rite for weeks until I finally made the trip up to SF to get some. I bought 2 pints (Salted Caramel & Roasted Banana). Those 2 pints did not last long in my freezer and 2 weeks later I was up in SF again buying 3 pints (Salted Caramel, Earl Gray & Mint Chip).... you get the picture... I also managed to get the rest of my family hooked on this place so that now when we go up to SF, there is a bi-rite phone chain. We have to call everyone to take orders because we all need our fix!

Do you like supporting local establishments? 'Cause i do, and this SF ice cream shop is awesome! Despite the city rarely ever having "ice cream weather," any day is the right day for some Bi-Rite's Ice Cream! But sometimes there is a crazy long line out the doors, so be prepared. Bring you friends and chat while waiting, and be sure to bundle up if it's one of those foggy cold sf days. I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE their Ricanelas flavor - cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodle cookie chunks. DELICOUS! I also like the Toffee Coffee and Salted Caramel. (it may sound odd, but it's really good!) Bi-Rite's is a must try! Come on, who doesn't love ice cream?

Bi-Rite is a MUST for any tourist or local! I have lived in SF for two years now and I have to say that Bi-rite is one of my favorite places for desert in the city. the Salted-Caramel and Riccanelas is to DIE FOR. But be careful, if the sun is out there will be a line around the block and it does take a while.. also the ice cream melts ridiculously fast so lick up. :)

The salted caramel icecream is as good as everyone says. Earl Grey was a bit too milky for my taste, but definitely tasted like Earl Grey tea. The honey lavender made me think of eating handcreme (something nice like L'Occitane, but nonetheless handcreme). Yay for Bi-Rite's use of compostable bowls and spoons.   Truth be told, we came here twice in two days on a trip to SF and it's probably best we had to return to our little culinary black hole in the Central Valley today or we might have waddled back tomorrow, and the next day, and the day after that....

I wouldn't say that this is the BEST ice cream i've ever had, but it was a nice experience. Perhaps I didn't try the right flavors (brown butter pecan, malted vanilla, roasted banana) but to me everything seemed a little similar in taste. I know that this place is an institution, but I really, really think that there are better options out there. I'll give it another try, I swear! I've also had a bad experience with salted caramel ice creams, so I refuse to try more. Of all the flavors that I tried, I'd say the malted vanilla was pretty great. The peanut brittle was a nice touch to it. By the looks of it, I would've expected brown butter pecan to have more flavor but I swear it was just vanilla ice cream... So I don't think this place was exactly bad, but it wasn't the best thing i've ever had. I'll be sure to give it a chance though. I feel a need to fill up that punch card!

You get what you pay for when you buy the best! It's hard to be disappointed with artisan ice cream made in small batches with fresh, local, mostly organic ingredients. You can't get any more San Francisco than that! Yes, people wait in line for this ice cream but smart locals come back later (the line moves fast) or go across the street to Bi-Rite market to get a pint of heaven to take home or share with a friend or two! Their single scoop lets you choose two flavors. A double scoop has three to four flavors and is far too decadent/too much of a good thing for one person, seriously! (Confession of an ice cream lover) My suggestions are my personal faves: Honey lavender started my addiction to Bi-Rite ice cream. Ricanelas is vanilla with cinnamon ice cream and snickerdoodle cookie bits mixed in: YUM! The salted caramel and coffee toffee are to die for, but not for the weak-hearted. They're the most intense flavors offered. The Popsicles are also very delicious; summer time fruits are my favorite flavors. The new soft serve window is a nice alternative; flavors are less intense so if it's your first time, you should try the ice cream to get the full Bi-Rite experience. Everyone that works there is so nice... and patient! When it isn't too busy, you can ask to taste as many flavors as you want =)

I tried the Salted Caramel, but its the Honey Lavender that still lingers in the back of my mind.  By far the best scoop of ice cream I've ever had!!

I was told to come here for the absolute best ice cream in SF.  I brought my friend here right in time as there was absolutely NO LINE which lasted all of 2 minutes before 12 people showed up behind us almost instantaneously.  As we initially had no pressure to hurry and order, we sampled just about every delectable flavor available.  Their new flavor was honey grahams, a combo of (I think?) vanilla ice cream with chocolate covered graham crackers, which was spot on.  The roasted banana was just the right degree of sweetness, thankfully not overpowering like over-ripe bananas that gross me out.  The honey lavender is very heavy on the lavender, overwhelming for me but I can see why people would like it.  I decided on the coconut, which was extremely creamy with nice slivers of shaved coconut and super fresh, and the mint chocolate chip which was better than just about any I've ever had (and mint chocochip is generally my go-to ice cream flavor in my eons of ice-cream-eating existence).  The server dude was super nice and patient with us as he spooned flavor after flavor for us.  While it put my lactose intolerance into overdrive like I've never experienced, it was so good that I'm sure I'll put myself in the same situation in the near future.

I heard so many great things about Bi-rite. I was in the neighborhood buying breads from tartine and my friend and I decided to try Bi-rite. Might as well go to Bi-rite since it is literally a few blocks away. Single scoop for $3.50. That is really a good price for two scoops. Especially how the ice creams are such great combinations and unique. I had the honey lavender and also the strawberry balsamic. Strawberry balsamic was SOOO delicious! I don't think I would have tried it if I wasn't first recommended to try it. The honey lavender was also delicious! Subtle flavor yet so refreshing. My friend got the salted caramel and roasted banana. The roasted banana was really good. In her view, it tasted like the Ben and Jerry's chunky monkey, but without the chocolate pieces. The salted caramel wasn't really my liking. I felt like it had more of this roasted flavor at the end. Overall, Strawberry Balsamic is a must try.

While I appreciate ice cream, 9 times out of 10 I would rather have a french fry. However, Bi-Rite may be just the thing to turn me to the sweet side. I felt like I needed to try the salted caramel and then also got the roasted banana. The salted caramel was excellent but the banana was mind.blowing. I will gladly take a night off from french fries to wait in line for this deliciousness.

This place has gotten me hooked...hooked on their Salted Caramel goodness.  There was a point in time where I came here once a week to get some of their Salted Caramel.  I even received a free single order because I filled up the punch card.  I've tried 2-3 other flavors but so far my favorite...as you can guess it...is Salted Caramel.  Great ice cream!!!

I freaking love this place! if I could give 10 stars i would. I never get sick of their icecream, ever. My fav is probably their salted caramel. My parents house is literally 6 min away so when I was living there i'd always hit up bi-rite , pretty often. Especially on hot days. Another great thing about this place is dolores park is right across the street so if you're with friends and want to relax and chill, you can just walk over and sit on the grass. Theres pretty long lines, but it is worth the wait. Staff is super friendly and attentive.  Only downside is...it is very hard to find parking.

I was in town and made it into this spot with my friend and had the Sam Sundae that i had heard about on food network. The chocolate was really good and the fresh whipped cream; the sundae did include a citrusy olive oil and sea salt added on top, so it was a diff type of sundae nothing usual, but it was different n we both enjoyed it, parking was near, and ur right across the street from dolores park. overall: would go bck.

im not sure why i bothered with so many samples... the second i heard they carried banana ice cream my subconscious had decided for me. wait....b a n a n a? yep, roasted banana creamy cold goodness! there is something about it that has proven time and again that it makes amazing ice cream (as well as gelato). bi-rite definitely continues that belief. we strolled in after a delightful lunch of Ike's in the park around the corner. i was given the heads up of its deliciousness, and though pretty full and satisfied, i couldnt pass up checking out another local fav. after a handful of samples on full-sized metal spoons, i got a scoop of banana (yes, banana!) and the peanut toffee brittle. amazing combo together. this is one of the creamiest ice creams ive ever had. and the selection of flavors are unique and sounded wonderful. i was damn near close to being a complete sample whore wanting to try all of them. but somehow the regular sized spoons they use made me feel guilty doing so. i never even thought to try the balsamic strawberry or lavender! gah, next time.. thanks for the recommendation david g! =)

I almost feel like I shouldn't review this place because my review will just get buried with the other 300+ reviews and it's not like it needs anymore help in getting customers in...but I'll do it just to say I've been here! =) For my last trip to San Francisco I made it a point that I NEEDED TO COME HERE whether it'd be with my girlfriends I was traveling with or my friends that lived there. Since the rest of the girls were visiting family on the Saturday we were visiting there, I went to have lunch with a friend and told him he needed to take me here because I've heard so much good stuffs about it from coworkers, clients, friends and yelpers. When we plugged the address into his GPS it brought us to some other weird location so we ended up getting lost for a good hour and we only found it after plugging it into his Iphone GPS. The parking there is horrible because everything is street parking so we parked a few blocks away and on top of a hill.  While we walked down to Bi-Rite it started raining but I was determined to eat here! With no rain or the cold stopping me! As soon as we got there, I was surprise to find no line outside or inside with us being the 1st in line. I was so excited to eat here that I tried various flavors from first trying the "salted caramel" then the "pumpkin" then the "mint chip" then the "roasted banana" and finally then the "honey lavender". I got the small cup with 2 scoops of ice cream which I opted for of course the salted caramel and honey lavender. As for my friend, he got the pumpkin and honey lavender. I don't know if I got the wrong batch but the Salted Caramel wasn't my fave because it was a bit too bitter..and my friend also said his batch was to salty. I do have to say that we both agreed that the honey lavender was to die for! It's a weird combination but totally awesome! It isn't to sweet nor was it boring...but it was just perfectly right! Only wish I got to try the olive oil when I visited because it was seasonal so they didn't have it at the time. This ice cream place is so good that while I was leaving the shop, I ran into my old boss from Hawaii!...small world, and definitely a bangn' whole in the wall place for 2 Hawaii visitors being here at the same time! Prices here are just right..very inexpensive for something so savory and good! Workers are also very helpful, and non judgmental when asking to keep trying the other flavors. The seats here are limited to only about 3 tables on the side but who wants to sit inside when Dolores park is right around the corner...perfect combination of ice cream and beautiful grassy park to eat on

Bi-Rite Creamery offers the #1 Ice Cream experience in SF. I had the salted caramel, honey lavender, and earl grey flavors, and each were so powerful in flavor yet tantalizing to the tongue, that I immediately understood the hype of Bi-Rite.  The Salted Caramel was definitely a favorite & is unlike anything I've ever tried before.  Smoky in a way that I didn't know ice cream could be. The Honey Lavender was also much stronger in flavor (yet not off-putting) & superior to other Lavender ice creams I've consumed.  I am thoroughly impressed with Bi-Rite and cannot wait to bring friends here in the future!

Don't let the line turn you off. Bi-Rite's ice cream is super delicious. It's creamy, dense, and most importantly packed with flavor. The orange cardamom is excellent as well as the ginger. Expect to get a ginger punch. And coffee toffee is like drinking an espresso. Their cookies look like they're hard, but they're actually just right: crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. If you like good ice cream, you must try Bi-Rite.

I'm not a big dessert person, but this place has some pretty decent ice cream.  I wouldn't say they're totally unique or anything.  Like others have mentioned, salted caramel and honey lavender are good. I left here with the impression that it was probably one of the best ice cream places I've had, but after my recent visit to Scoop's in LA, my opinions have changed. Bi-Rite is probably the best SF has to offer, but if you like it you gotta make a stop by Scoop's next time you're down south and be your own judge.

I've been wanting to try this place for awhile after seeing that they had a strange concoction of the chocolate ice cream with olive oil and salt. My wife likes to collect different salts from all over so she tried  the "Sam's Sundae" it tasted good but I think it would have been better with a little less salt. But that's just me. The staff is very friendly and patient as I wasn't sure what I wanted. Luckily when I was there, the line wasn't too long. So I ordered a "Salted Caramel" sundae with some toasted almonds and my oh my it was awesome. I'm a fan of caramel so I had high hopes for this when I finally decided to get it. The inside is quite small and only has a few small tables, long bench seat against the window and some stools. Nice water fountain too. Parking in this area can be aggravating. I'll definitely be back here though if I get a chance.

Dear Bi-Rite, I don't know if it's truly that you are delicious or that your flavors are so imaginative, but you saved my night tonight.  After a horrible dinner, I needed a pick-me-up and my friend took me to see you.  There was a line, but something told me you would be worth the wait.  When I got to your counter, you wonderful, creative flavors (many sprinkled with topping treats like peanut brittle and cookies and cream or honey) distracted me.  Your staff was very patient as I made my decision though: a single scoop of vanilla fraiche on a sugar cone - a perfect, normal-sized scoop too... like the scoop mom would give me as a kid (the one scooped out with a tablespoon instead of an ice cream scoop).  Before I knew it, the experience was over, but I was far from mad. Sometimes, just sometimes, you only need a taste to appreciate the true divinity of this dairy delight.  For that, I wrote you a little diddy.  Sing it if you like: Bi-rite... you did me right.... you saved my night! And for, that my dear, you are truly out of sight. Baby, baby, baby... you are DY-NO-MITE!

Ricanela ice cream and roasted banana ice cream. ALWAYS! Early January, my bf and I driving around trying to find parking.  We snagged a 15 min. parking spot 3 blocks away.  We ran, in the rain, to Bi-Rite to get ice cream.  Yes it was that important.  Actually, it was the only reason we really drove 1.5 hours from Sacramento to San Francisco. No one was in there, but after we paid we turned around and the small space was packed with a line out the door.  It really is that serious.

Walked across the street this weekend after lunch at Delfina Pizzeria.  Had 3 scoops: roasted banana, salted caramel and toffee coffee.  All were very good.  'Creamery' isn't a misnomer -- the texture was indeed very creamy compared to the more crystalline offerings at Sketch in Berkeley.  The flavour of the salted caramel isn't quite as complex as Sketch's burnt caramel, but the coffee is very similar (except, of course, for the chunks of toffee).  Roasted banana was a perfect compliment to the other two scoops.  After giving it some consideration, I'm partial to the style at Sketch -- more ice, less cream -- but Berkeley is a long way from Tartine & Delfina! update:  had a sundae with brown butter pecan & roasted banana.   banana definitely tops here -- butter pecan wasn't 'brown' enough.  The honey lavender is great too.

OK, OK, this was as amazing as everyone claims it is. I love that you can order a single scoop and get two flavors, brilliant! The salted caramel was really good, it tasted just like a Werther's Original.  My favorite though was the balsamic strawberry. Two things really good on their own, but with their powers combined . . . I only take away one star (i would take off half if i could) because I thought the sugar cone tasted like cardboard. Yes i know that Bi-Rite prides itself on being natural and organic but the cone should not be.  Next time I will get a cup.   If only it wasn't so close to my work . . . this could be trouble.

My boyfriend and I love ice cream.. he loves Mitchell's and I love Bi rite. so we try to go to both evenly... their flavors are different, consistent and delicious. balsamic strawberry and roasted bananas are the ones I always order. When I want to take it to the next level, I ask for brownie pieces on top. The little chunks of goodness are moist and gooey... ah... nothing better than adding another 500 calories to your ice cream, especially after a nice, heavy dinner. after you have your ice cream, take a nice stroll at dolores park. on a clear night, you have this beautiful view of the city, which makes your ice cream-eating experience more formidable.

After the free stuff fair in Dolores Park, my omnivore friends craved some ice cream, so we stopped by Bi-Rite. I was just waiting in line with them, when BAM! I saw it. Soy chocolate ice cream. So I picked up a scoop with some roasted walnuts. It was bomb. Even on a cold day.

Considering that this place has over 1000 positive reviews, maybe ... well, I want my say anyway! I ordered an ice cream cake for my husband's birthday the morning of -- the catering menu indicates orders need to be made 3 days in advance.  Luckily they do carry a few pre-made ice cream cakes so I went for the mint chip ice cream over dark chocolate cake.  It was a hot Saturday afternoon when I walked in to pick up the cake, bypassing at least 30 people who were waiting in line for a scoop of ice cream.  The thrill of being able to cut the line and walk out with not just a scoop or two of ice cream but an entire ice cream cake... PRICELESS. The cake itself was perfect.  I've had plenty of Baskin Robbins ice cream cakes and Bi-Rite's is way better.

All the five-star ratings here are yet more proof that many yelpers either have little grasp on high-quality & are way too easily impressed. Yes, the ice cream is good here, maybe the best I've had in SF, but it's nothing super special. All the flavours seem to be Philadelhia-style, rather than French-style ice creams & the cream content does seem a bit off. Also, the flavours could do with some punching up. The ice creams pale into comparison to ice cream I've had in Berlin, as well as my home-made ice cream. If you want really good ice cream, invest in an ice-cream maker & some quality ingredients. It's really simple to make & oh-s0-bloody good.

Excellent selection of homemade ice cream and generous servings, whether you are ordering a cup or cone. Personally, I take my ice cream in a cup, no matter what people say. I really liked the butter pecan, but wasn't much of a fan of the salted caramel. Guess we'll see what other flavors I like next few times I return.

Easily the best ice cream ever on the face of the earth!!! Its super good and the people who work there are super nice! Its located right next to dolores park so after you get ice cream you can enjoy the beautiful scenery on a hill. Its not cheap, but not pricey...On hot nights it can get pretty busy, creating a line of around 15 people out the door, near the street corner. There are also benches outside if you don't want to go to the park. This place is wonderful. Just go...you won't believe it will be your first time, and it definitely won't be your last!

Okay, so I like playing Russian Roulette with incredibly amazing flavors of ice cream and today I got nailed with one of the best I've ever had...Chai Spiced Milk Chocolate!!!! Holy Cannoli, it just about made me cry, it was so dang good. The spicy chai and silky chocolate are such great playmates, I hope they stay together for a long, long time. There is a strong cardamom finish that just carries you away to nirvana with every bite. mmmmm....more, please! ***One note of caution: Don't get there too late! because if you stick around and sit on the bench and eat your ice cream,  you'll have to see all the sad people who show up after they've closed. It's hearbreaking to see those long faces as you greedily devour your cone.

We decided to head over after dinner on a week night. We lucked out cause when we got there, the line was short, and it quickly grew by the time we had ordered. The variety of flavors was awesome and the servers were great about letting us try different options. I tasted the roasted banana, which had a good flavor (although i wouldn't say it was very different from a regular banana flavor... but still very tatsy). I also tried the Honey Lavender, which was amazing.. and different, as well as the salted caramel. I ended up getting the balsamic strawberry, which at first just tastes like strawberry, but you start to notice the slight tang to it, which is a great, subtle flavor. I'd go back again, just to try the other flavors as well as the cakes and cookies they also sell. :)

Been here 3 times in the last week since my first try last Friday night!! Price- Around $2.50 for a kids size, $3.50 for a adult size which has 2 scoops.  I think it's a great deal!! Ice Cream- this isn't the place for you if you're looking for VANILLA ice cream.  They're known for the creativity of their flavors! My Favorites- Salted Carmel, Toasted Coconut, Brown Sugar with ginger.   Line and Parking-  Line is always wrapped around the street corner.  I was there last Friday around 10:30pm and we waited about 30 mins.  Was there again Sunday afternoon, about 30 min wait too.  As for the parking, try to go with somebody so you can drop them off too wait in line.  With Dolores Park right there, parking is chaotic.

Bi Rite gets 5 stars for getting it right in all the areas they could have gone wrong. -cute and clean interior -unique and masterfully balanced flavors -creamy ice cream -sweetness is just right -consistent quality and open just the right hours -offer sundaes and cookies, brownies, other pastries -nice, efficient staff -frequent buyer card As my experience with SF ice creameries expands,so does my appreciation for Bi-Rite Creamery. I think sometimes ice creameries that try to get creative don't get the balance of mixing flavors right or get a little too creative.  Bi-Rite has a pretty regular menu of flavors that you can come back and get consistently. My favorites are Balsamic Strawberry - strawberry with JUST the right amount of balsamic tang, Honey Mint Lavender might be one of my favorite ice creams of all times - it has a yummy aromatic taste/smell that is actually really soothing - and the honey tinges it with a comforting sweet, and Ricanelas which is cinnamon snickerdoodle - the cinnamon is so good and the snickerdoodle chunks drive me wild.   YUMMM.  I will eat anything and everything here.  And of course, it's conveniently located to Dolores Park.  You can also stroll over there from any Mission restaurant after dinner. They also have gift cards, which I've bought for a friend's birthday before;  you can also find their pints of ice cream at the Bi-Rite Market if you're there and want to take some home.  If they don't have a pint of what you want, they will hand pack pints of whatever flavor you want.

I like ice cream.  I really like the ice cream at this ice cream store. I am struggling to distinguish my review from those of my predecessors.  You know the ice cream is good, so let me tell you about my experience with the store, instead of the ice cream itself. As we waited in the sizable line, a guy walked by and loudly asked the crowd to part so he could get through, explaining he is a local.  But I looked at the faces in the line around me.  They were clearly locals, too.  Maybe not on that block, but surely from nearby.  And it made me think, damn, this ice cream must really be good, because even the locals will wait in line for it. Thumbs up.

When considering Bi-Rite Creamery, the right question is whether it's line-worthy. Is it line-that-goes-out-the-door-down-the-block-and-­sometimes-around-the-corner-worthy? The unique flavors make this place worth it. If you're looking for standard vanilla, skip it. Go to Albertsons. If you're looking for salted caramel, or brown sugar with ginger twist, or lavender honey, or any of the other bizarre and random flavors, this is where you'll find them. And for that, it gets five stars. Yay!

It's great ... unquestionably great ice cream. There are two problems: 1. The line 2. The people in the line who insist on tasting every flavor when they know that there 7,000 people in line behind them. See my review of Tartine, because it's almost the same.

Bi-Rite, how I love thee!  The salted caramel ice cream is, to paraphrase Dave Chappelle, this ice cream is the shizniddle bam snip snap sack. 8 bones is a healthy pricetag for a pint of ice cream, but Bi-Rite is worth it...and it's a great way to score serious points with the lady for under 10 bucks.

A great friend took me here during my visit to SF. The ice cream is amazing so rich and delicious. My only complaint is that they do not have  a branch in NYC. The lavender was my favorite!

Nothing like homemade ice cream. It was probably one of the best cookies and cream I've ever had. Creamy with a nice portioned chunks of cookies. The Vanilla ice cream with brownies and toasted almonds were better than Ghirdelli (in San Francisco). Loved that toasted almond crunch with the chewy brownie finish. They also had some sugar cane soda that I've never seen before that was quite interesting.

Parking sucks there. REALLY SUCKS. Read street signs! Ice cream is great. Watch out for the time frame for parking. I think once it hits 3pm during the week it becomes a no parking zone. So my Ice cream cost me $400 bucks haha. Also after 3pm the cabbies line up to pick up all the people who got towed. I walked in ordered, walked out and the whole street was towed :) But the Ice Cream was great!

Strawberry Rhubarb and Salted Caramel Ice Cream!? Whatthewhat!!??!! I got my cone and walked over to Dolores Park with my girls, it was one of the best memories I have of my hometown. I told the "dude" that served me that I liked his headband. I'm still laughing about it.

If Bi-Rite Creamery was closer to my house, I would weight 300lbs. This ice cream shop was an instant hit since the day it opened. The ice cream is so fracking good! Yes the line can be hellacious, but if determined, well worth it. The sundaes are crazy good and get me zipping around like a 3 year old full of Otter Pops. A definite sugar bomb. So tasty. The creamery/bakery has expanded and now has a walk up soft serve window. Got to love that! If you find the scoop line too unbearable, maybe the soft serve window will do the trick. I recommend everything : )~

FINALLY! Every time I pass by this joint, there's a line snaking around the corner. I paid a visit to GRX this past rainy Sunday and noticed the absence of a line. I immediately scampered over and tried their Honey Lavender and Salted Caramel with Ginger. KICK BUTT. The workers behind the counter were a delight, actually walking each customer through the myriad flavors (unlike the dbags at Humphrys) You would expect with a constant flow of customers, they would be too busy to give you samples. The hype here is totally legit.

Whenever I get out of town visitors, I take them here. Each one of them says its the best ice cream they have ever had. You really can't go wrong with any flavors; even chocolate will amaze you. My favorite though, is the salted caramel. Theres something about the salty burnt surgery taste that I love. Eat it quick though, because it melts faster than other favors. I recently tried their banana split as well, which was delicious and way more than enough for two people! When I saw the employee pull put a blow torch and start melting caramel over the banana, I knew I was in for something special. I've heard Mitchell's is better, but the location of Bi Rite makes it better by default.  Get your amazing ice cream, and go enjoy it at the park across the street! There is nothing better!

My Format: Price, Atmosphere, Selection (of products), Customer service, and Final thoughts. Price (5 Stars) As I always say, if the price fits the craftsmanship and taste then they deserve to get paid for it. I feel fine paying $5 for 3 scoops of the best ice cream I have ever tasted. Atmosphere (5 Stars) Not much to the place but  the line around the corner will give you a good feeling about whats to come. Expect a looooong line come summer. Selection (5 Stars) Lots of flavors and holders for them, not much else to say :-P Pre-packed pints too. Customer Service (5 Stars) I once went in there asking for my 3 flavors in 3 separate cups because I hated with my mint chip got mixed with cookies and cream and other flavors. Its almost a crime for the flavors to befoul each other like three princes in a fight to the death for the sovereign crown. So they  made me happy and i left with a fistful of cups :-) Thats called going the extra step. Final thoughts... This is what ice cream was meant to be. I normally love a ton of chunks in my ice cream but with this place less is truly more. A MUST TASTE when you come to S.F. The mint chip will clear your sinuses... and its not green!!!

Ice scream for ICE CREAM! One of the best places to get ice cream. I've visited this joint many, many times and every time, there's a line out the door! The flavors and concoctions are just so yummmy, my mouth is drooling just thinking about it!   Of course, SF weather isn't always on the sunny-side - so it doesn't exactly scream ice cream weather.

Bi-rite Creamery has a variety of dandy ice cream flavors to choose from daily! Everything about this place is awesome! It's located right next to Dolores Park so you can always grab a cone and relax on the patchy grass. If that doesn't suit you, Bi-rite has a cute set up of small tables and chairs for you to enjoy your dessert. My personal favorites are the Roasted Banana and the Earl Grey! Bi-rite also carries novelty popsicles, ice cream sandwiches, baked goods, sundaes, and ice cream cakes and pies! Be sure to check this place out if you're in the area!

Bi-Rite's ice cream speaks for itself.  They're one ice cream that knocks everyone's socks off is Salted Caramel.  Freakin' amazing!  I also like a Rickanellas and Creme Fraiche as well.  I think its way better than the Mitchell's or Humphrey's Slocumbe (Humphrey's is pretty good though).   The Bi-Rite store across the street also has some of the flavors if the line is way too long.  The best time to go is around 9pm on a weekday where there is hardly a line.

I'll wait thirty minutes in line for a rollercoaster, but not for an ice cream cone.  That line of reasoning always keeps me from coming here on weekends, when Dolores Park is full to capacity and the line at Bi-Rite runs around the block. On a Monday evening though I was willing to wait five minutes to see what the fuss was all about.  I got a cone with salted caramel because that's what everybody else makes a big deal of, and mint chip because I always like mint chip.   Salted caramel tasted like the sugar was allowed to burn a little too much, and was melting all over the place before I could even get it to the park.  Sorry, doesn't live up to the hype. Mint chip tasted better and was much more structurally sound.  Still, since all mint chip ice cream is delicious, I'm not really sure how much credit to give them for that. Overall, I really like ice cream, and Bi-Rite Creamery sells ice cream.  If I'm in the neighborhood and want ice cream and the line isn't outrageous, I'll gladly come back and try some other flavors.

There are 2,000 reviews (really??). I don't need to say much else. So I'll make it short: -Skip that puritanical single scoop gig and get yourself a sundae -Salted caramel- it's not terrible, but it's certainly not their best -Last time I was there they had something in the freezer called a s'mores pie. I don't know what was in it, but I know that I love it already. They were also playing Daydream Nation. For this, they have my heart.

I was fortunate enough to be sent to San Francisco for a conference and I researched the places I wanted to try. This was at the top of my list. I visited during the day so as to avoid lines. I went back again before the week was up, and would have gone even more had my travel companions been willing. But it was inconvenient to go to the Mission from where we were staying. I tried Earl Grey, Honey Lavender, Coffee Toffee and Salted Caramel. I loved them all. My travel companions thought that Honey Lavender tasted like soap...not everyone likes lavender flavors in food. The servers are so incredibly friendly to the point where they all seem pleasantly drugged. Nothing wrong with that. I might be that happy without the benefit of drugs if I could spend my days around high quality ice cream. I've seen some reviews suggesting that Bi-Rite is nothing special...how jaded would you have to be? We don't have anything like this here in the provinces of Washington DC. This ice cream haunted me. When I got back from my trip, I tried to figure out how I could get ice cream this good here at home. Tried Moorenko's - didn't do it. Tried SoCo creamery's Earl Grey. Not as good. Finally, I decided to try making my own ice cream. I used David Lebowitz's book and blog and was very happy with the results. You don't have to be a good cook, just able to follow directions. I would love to be back enough times to try every flavor and the ice cream treats such as ice cream sandwiches made with gingersnaps and Meyer lemon ice cream. For those of us not fortunate enough to live in San Francisco, apparently a Mecca of ice cream, Bi-Rite creamery is a peak experience.

SALTED CARAMEL. Holy crap. Very nice staff. It's always surprising to meet such patient workers at an ice cream store especially when people like my friends and I walk in.  We are the most indecisive people ever.  So embarrassing. But all the workers had a smile on their face the whole entire time, even if we took half an hour to choose...  I had a even bigger smile when I had some of our Make Your Own Sundae (Brownie + 2 Ice cream flavors).   Can't wait to try the other flavors!

Yelp keeps telling me to write a review so here it is, the first review of a long time yelper.  I'll try to keep it short and sweet. The ice cream here is one of my favorites in the city. I like the ricanelas (i think that's how you spell it). People usually line up up out the door for this ice cream. The parking sucks, but sometimes you get lucky.

Salted Caramel + Vanilla swirl on a cone = delicious. I wasn't expecting a lot because I always take Yelp reviews with a grain of salt (ha) but upon tasting my towering cone of creamy goodness, I was a believer. It's on the pricier side, sure, but I think they give you a good amount of ice cream, and you can't argue with the quality.

Bi-Rite ice cream could be creamier--it is a bit powdery-- but the flavors are excellent. I thought that I was going to love the salted caramel, as I adore salty/sweet flavor combinations, and was surprised to find that I didn't care for it.  It lacked sweetness and was somewhat bitter.  Also, the sea salt sprinkled on Sam's Sundae (see below) provided a much more appreciable salty kick than that in the salted caramel.  I would have enjoyed the salted caramel more if it had a sweet caramel swirl in it plus sea salt. I liked the honey lavender ice cream a lot-- very fresh tasting and redolent of lavender.  It is unique and a real treat for anyone who loves lavender-- like me! My favorite was the ricanelas-- cinnamon ice cream with cinnamon sugar cookies (a.k.a. snickerdoodles.)  Why is there not more sweet cinnamon ice cream in the world?  It is fabulous. I also sampled Sam's Sundae-- chocolate ice cream with bergamot olive oil (bergamot is a type of citrus), sea salt, and fresh whipped cream.  Aside from the chocolate ice cream being a little powdery in texture, the sundae was very good.  Lightly salted chocolate is fantastic! The line was out the door on a Saturday night but moved pretty quickly. I look forward to sampling more flavors, and in the meantime highly recommend the honey lavender and the ricanelas.

Driving through the Mission at 2 pm on a Tuesday, I decided to take a detour and stop by Bi-Rite.  Coincidentally, there was a parking spot right in front of the shop.  And, NO LINE at all.  I breezed right in and asked for a taste of the roasted banana (I already knew I wanted to try out the legendary salted caramel).   For $4.75, I got three scoops - one each of the roasted banana, salted caramel, and creme fraiche.  Not a fan of caramel in general, and this solidified my dislike of the flavor.  If Bi-Rite's amazing salted caramel can't convert me, nothing can.  But the creme fraiche was great, and the roasted banana, even better.  Pure, sweet, but not overwhelmingly cloying, banana flavor infused into a smooth, creamy, ice cream with rich mouth-feel.  You can't get banana ice cream better than this.

Just did a self-guided food tour of San Francisco/Berkeley/Oakland (including: Commis, Chez Panisse Cafe, Delfina Pizzeria, Range, Bi-Rite Creamery, Tartine, Vik's Chaat Corner and La Rose Bistro, etc.) I am going to forego my lengthy reviews and write several short ones - well, I'll try to keep it short at any rate. CUT TO THE CHASE: Bi-Rite has my favorite flavor of ice cream that I have ever eaten - SALTED CARAMEL - hands down the richest and most effective flavor of ice cream ever! EVER! And the best ice cream I have had in these United States. (Gelato we can argue about later - here, we are talkin' Ice Cream.) In Paris, Bertillon serves a Dried Plum and Armagnac Ice Cream that made me weepy it was that good - and I understand that they too serve a Salted Caramel now - I have not tasted it yet - next time I am in Paris is will try it though and report back to you - until then BI-RITE IS CHAMPION!

I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PLACE! Love that they do not rush you and let you try any flavor before you purchase. I always feel welcomed here, the customer service is always awesome and they're so friendly. The ice cream is pretty good too, no, it's AMAZIIIIIIIING. I cannot rave any more about it. I've been here several times, and will keep coming back because BiRite has earn my money and trust in delicious ice cream. The salted caramel, malted vanilla with peanut butter and milk chocolate pieces, and coffee toffee are my three absolute faves. I switch flavors and pair them with a double scoop on a waffle/sugar cone depending on my mood. The lines are long for a reason, but by the time you get to the front, omg, it's so awesome to point and laugh at the other customers whom are waiting in line to buy ice cream when you've got one in your hand. The first bite and it's def like a taste of heaven in your mouth (not that I'd know what heaven tastes like) but the ice cream sure does a real good job at telling me. I'm like a like kid at the candy shop when it comes to me and ice cream. MMMMM so good, think I might have to pay BiRite a visit soon, my ice cream senses are ticking. happy eating! :)

My friends and I were roped into coming here upon seeing how much rave reviews this place garnered as well as its ability to maintain a 4.5 star status based on its 3,000+ reviews. There was a long line, but it's well worth the wait.  The people who work there have a very friendly attitude and are incredibly patient with my friends and I, who all tried a variety of samples before deciding on a flavor.  I ended up choosing the creme fraiche; its rich icy taste will definitely have me coming back for more soon.  Overall, very satisfying experience and they also cater to Vegans with their chocolate coconut flavor which definitely makes the ice cream experience an inclusive one.

Best homemade ice cream! Definitely exceeds Mitchell's. What do you do if there is a long line and it's raining? Just wait! Definitely worth it. I went in here determined to try all the flavors...and sure enough, loved every one of them. All the flavors are pretty good, and I like how they change up the flavors every day. LA could use a place like this :(.  Would recommend you to taste test everything, especially brown sugar with ginger swirl (not as sweet as you would think it to be) and roasted banana.

This is my absolute favorite new Ice Cream joint.  My mouth waters when I think of how good it is here, and that's kind of a weird thing to do over ice cream.  I don't go into the City often, but when I do, I will definitely come here from now on.  It's worth the drive to the Mission Dist.  Even if you have to circle around for 10min looking for parking in this small neighborhood, this place is worth the effort. All their flavors are so unique.  They even have some that have a little hint of flower tastes to them.  I ended up going with the Earl Grey b/c it tasted just like the tea.  I loved it so much, I even bought a pint home with me.  The place is that good!  Definitely a must go whenever you're in the City.

If I could choose a place to clumsily break my leg, it would be right in front of this place. My injuries would be iced by some of the best icecream I've ever eaten. Pretty great stuff. While I'm a huge Fenton's Creamery fan, Bi-Rite is nowhere near as cloying or overkill. I love the distinctiveness of the flavours, if that even makes sense. Salted Caramel, Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl, and Ricanelas (snickerdoodle-type flavour) are my fave fave faves. And I love the portions too. I'm not getting hit over the head with a tub o' lard. The olive oil icecream sample I had was surprisingly awesome, like an orange-infused spoonful of vanilla buttery (but slightly salted) popcorn. One of these days, when I get my teeny paycheck, I'm about to devour a legit scoop-sized version. Oh man...the Ricanelas though...makes me want to faint with weakness. Sigh.

Great icecream at Bi-rite! I had the deliciously rich salted caramel, Ricanela and Brown Butter Pecan. My favorites were the salted caramel and Ricanela- the Brown Butter Pecan's flavor was a bit more subtle than the other two- it was good but not amazing like the others. Wow, talk about FLAVOR! It was dead when we got there so we also got to taste a few other flavors- the service was great. It's more expensive than other ice cream shops but it's not "other" ice cream- it's hand-crafted, superflavorful, life-affirming ice cream. Grab some then eat it in the park right up the street!

holy moly! this place is the bomb! and im sure im going to be saying the same things everyone's already said in the near 4,000 reviews, but salted caramel, blown away!!!!! sure, there was a line wrapped around the corner, but hanging with friends, people watching (and trying to see cars park in the itty bitty spots nearby), watching you tube videos, the time went by fast. really, the line had about a good 30+ people, but id say it took us about 20 minutes or so to get inside to order. had a sampling of the basil (too strong for me, even as a basil lover) and the honey lavender (so delish!) but settled on the salted caramel and roasted banana (single scoops) as i thought they would compliment one another. my friend got sam's sundae (chocolate ice cream, olive oil, and salt) and that was good too, but a little too salty for me. my salted caramel was heavenly...just the right amount of each flavor. the banana was so-so, regretted not getting the lavender. i like how you can get 1-3 flavors for the scoops, and the singles were perfect for me. i saw the pints are $7.99 which is a bit hefty, but the ingredients and concoctions they think of are genius. would definitley come back next time im in the area.

Salted caramel? yes please!  Before you go knocking on the weird assortment of flavors, try this place out!  Lines are usually out the door on a warm day but it's totally worth the wait.  The staff are chillax and will let you try zillions of flavors before making you commit.  I would definitely grab at least 2 scoops of ice cream because you'll finish your 1 scoop before you're out the door (it's that good).  Try earl grey or the lavender for something unique and delicious, or salted caramel is always a goody.  YUM, now I want some ice cream...geez.

Great way to end the night after a somewhat disappointing dinner.  The minute I walked in I was greeted with a smile.  I asked to taste the coffee toffee and girl at the counter made me a mini scoop of that along with another flavor.  It was delicious!  Ultimately I ended up with a scoop of candy cane on a sugar cone.  I have a weakness for peppermint ice cream.  The only disappointing thing was the gingerbread cookie.  I thought it was going to be nice and soft and chewy, but it ended up being hard.  My fault since I didn't ask, so I can't knock them a point for that.  This is as good as it gets!

I love the flavor of caramel but I can't stand how it sticks to your teeth. The perfect application is in icecream, and Bi-Rite does it oh so well. They make icecream how it's supposed to be, rich and flavorful. Icecream just isn't the same after eating here.

Other than the painful search for parking, this place has the BEST brown sugar ice cream. I didn't like the salted caramel as much as I wanted to because I've had better, but the brown sugar ice cream was really good. We waited in line for a short while (around 7:30pm ish). The place is a bit packed with people inside and outside and the atmosphere is pretty loud. I enjoyed the atmosphere because it truly reminded me of Europe, where people enjoy themselves in a cramped place. I will be back for your brown sugar ice cream!

Yummy!! I got the snickerdoodle and oreo ice-cream. Both were very tasty, but the after though gives me a tooth ache due to how sweet it is. But I must say, very innovative flavors. I can't wait to come back to try a sundae of some sort next! That is to say, I will be back!

good ice cream, good price, good location. the people that work there are really nice, and the ice cream is really creamy just like everyone says, BUT...i haven't found a flavor that I like yet. i like basil, and olive oil with my bread...but NOT as an ice cream flavor =X ginger peach was REALLY ginger-y...too gingery for me. and i couldn't distinguish any balsamic flavor in the balsamic strawberry, and the brown sugar ginger caramel didn't wow me either. i'd recommend trying it though, but even on a weekday evening at 10pm there was a line 15+ people long, so bring a jacket!

I waited in line for awhile, but it was worth it.   The salted caramel ice cream is to die for.  And the lavender infused ice cream refreshing. I have read here that going into the market for a pint of your favorite ice cream is the best way to go if you're in a rush or have kids hanging on you and can't wait in line but want the yummy yummy ice cream.  And I wish they would open a bi rite creamery on the sf peninsula or at LEAST visit our local farmer's markets. :)

This is the best ice cream I've ever had! The salted caramel is soooo good and perfectly creamy. The dainty gentleman is amazing (blood orange olive oil ftw). The only drawback is the enormous line that took ~20min to reach the counter. Oh and don't ever think about driving here as there's absolutely no parking to be found.

Just what I needed to end a Sunday afternoon.  I'm not much of a dessert person but on this particular day ice cream sounded good to me.  Not your typical flavors so the menu does tend to bend the mind and trip up the taste buds.  Yes, there was a line but it was quick and painless.  Definitely worth another trip.  Be daring; go for it!

FINALLY!  I'm born and raised in SF and had never gotten around to trying Bi Rite until last night.  I've tried a few times but the has always been insane.  But finally last night, the gods smiled- there was a line of only four people and a parking spot right in front  **alleluia** I sampled three flavors, roasted banana, almond fudge and ricanelas, before deciding on the ricanelas.  The guy helping us was very nice and encouraged us to try as many flavors as he wanted.  My date also tried three before deciding to order the Brown Butter Pecan.   They have a few benches outside where you can enjoy your ice cream like we did.  I can't wait to go back and try other flavors, including their soft serve next door- mexican chocolate and vanilla swirl.

Social proof! That's all it is! I was really not as enamored with this place as the other 3,000 reviewers were. I got the brownie sundae; the brownies tasted like they had been sitting out for days, the ice cream itself was garbage, like that white stuff you get in the big tubs at the grocery store. It was nothing that made me feel like i needed to come back for it, certainly not for 6.50 (and a long wait in line in a seedy part of town). The three other people I were with each got different specials and were equally unimpressed. I think my brother described his flavor as "poppyseed with motor oil and stale antler shavings." If you're a tourist and you want to say you've been to a place with 3,000+ reviews, perhaps you can give it a shot, but its utterly forgettable. Mitchell's (and Humphrey Slocumbe, if you're into the alternative flavors) are FAR superior to this place. If you really like ice cream i suggest you go there instead.

salted caramel is the best flavor on the planet. however.  the place is getting way too cluttered & messy. sam - please make the signs uniform & take most of them out. you don't need about 90% of them. just stick w/ the menu. clutter suggests chaos which hints @ mess & yes, dirt. you don't have to go pinkberry minimal, but the store should be less. well, cluttered.

I was excited to buy ice cream from this popular creamery in the MIssion. It's pretty easy to find because of the lines right outside the door and the ice cream cone right above. I got the regular 2 scoop Tropical Thunder which was burnt banana and toasted coconut in a gluten free cone. The staff were really friendly and made my first visit enjoyable.

The staff here is SO friendly, accommodating and passionate about their product.  Even with the long Saturday-night line behind me, they did not rush me and encouraged me to try as much as I wanted before making my decision.  The salted caramel was so good, but, since the ice cream is so rich and creamy, I wanted to limit myself to two scoops.  I got the malted vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate pieces (yes that is one flavor!) and the coffee toffee.  Biodegradable cups, wooden spoons.  Limited seating but it can be fun to rub elbows.  Cool old and new school rap music playing in the background.

I am the dessert orderer---you know the one everyone at the table looks at when the server asks if you saved room for dessert (I KNOW you biatches want it too, just using my obsession as an excuse!) Let's keep it simple: ice cream = 5 stars! (lavender?--mmmm, crushed almonds w/ fresh cherries?---delicious!, salted caramel?--get the f*ck outta here, chai-spiced milk cholcolate?--every time!) service = 4 stars, pretty cool about letting folks try flavors, though that Mission-y cool attitude prevails) set-up & wait = 3 stars----totally agree w/ the idea about the numbers, having to post up in line is sucky! also, it's ALWAYS out the door and it's usually pretty foggy/cold outside (ok, remind me again, I'm shivering int he cold to buy a frozen treat???) overall....I do CRAVE this place, and would go much more often if it wasn't such a craptacular pain in the ass (parking...waiting...shivering)

First review ever..Yeah me! After hearing mixed reviews from friends about the ice cream, I'd thought I stop by to try firsthand. There are about a dozen flavors on display, some of the usual suspects (cookies and cream) and a few yummy different looking flavors. I tasted two: the honey lavendar and the salted caramel. I liked both because it was different but not too weird. The employee was friendly and  helpful. I ended up with the salted caramel which was rich, creamy and sweet. I got a single scoop and I almost didn't finish it because it was way rich and almost too sweet. if you are craving  ice cream like they used to make it in the old creameries, come here. It's definitely a treat but too much might make you feel a little sick...

My friends and I ventured here on Saturday afternoon after enjoying lunch at Zuni Cafe and miraculously found a parking space down the street without having to drive around endlessly. To top it off, it was a perfect day for ice cream as the sun was shining and a slight breeze made sitting outside a treat. Never having been here prior to this experience, I was happy to see there was almost no line as only four (4) people stood between me and the ice cream. I expected gobs of people as other reviewers mentioned but we got lucky I suppose. As you wait in line, there are one of many temptations swaying you from actually getting to the ice cream like the chocolate cake and other assorted goodies sitting on the shelf just left of the counter. I was almost lead astray but kept to my objective as I only wanted one thing... samples of every ice cream flavor available. Samples of strawberry balsamic, salty caramel, honey lavender, and roasted banana were tried. We decided not to be greedy plus we didn't want to hold up the line. Everything was amazing and creamy!!! Everyone a hit in my opinion but I needed to decide on one scoop. I could have gone for a four scoop but resisted the notion. My order ended up being a scoop of honey lavender in a sugar cone all for $2.95. Pure heaven in my book. I like how they have compostable cups and spoons if you are carb-phobic. They also have benches outside for those days when you want to make people jealous of your cold and delicious handheld treat.

Get in line!  It's worth the wait as is all the good things in life are! Okay, so I was recommended to go the first time by friends.   I got very excited, like I do at all new experiences, and had to try 3 flavors, which I do not recommend because they tend to fight each other. The three: Salted Caramel, Honey Lavender & Chai Spiced Milk Chocolate.  All were AMAZING individually! The second time, this past weekend, I tried the Honey Lavender with the sugar cookie topping! mmmmmm! Each bite felt like I was at this fabulously, well-catered 5-year-olds birthday party! Oh and so impressed with the biodegradable bowls, and also that they use silverware to sample instead of plastic! Now that I live in SF, there is no doubt I will want to trot to down again and again to Bi-Rite and have that tasteful and youthful experience!

Ice cream lovers rejoice! Funky, exotic flavors and fresh creamy product. Soooo yummy.  We've made the pilgrimage 5+ times, especially with out of town guests. I would give it a 5 except for the location and bad parking situation. Also standing room only - so everyone eats outside in the foggy cold night. I love mango, chai hot chocolate, lavender, etc. Friends love the salted caramel.

I have had a series of trips with friends to bi rite to enjoy their ice cream. It is a real treat to have such unique flavors and great ingredients, Strauss cream dominates all dairy. The salted caramel is always the first for anyone new and afterwords you can go for more avaunt Gard flavors such as balsamic strawberry. Mexican chocolate is very good, not to spicy but enough to clear your nose. The Snikerdoodle flavor is ballen. its like some took millions of snicker doodles  and compacted them, froze them, and offered it on a cone. go to bi rite for something good. If anyone is a Mitchell's Fan,  perfect. But that doesn't mean you cant enjoy good ice cream. Don't compare, just sample.

I actually do not understand why this place isn't rated 5 stars! This place offers very dynamic flavors and that is why their flavors are superb! They only have about 8-10 flavors but they have mastered and perfected each one. I chose salty caramel and cookies n cream, a single scoop of each but my taste buds were longing for more when I finished. They also bake! I have not tried it but tasting their ice cream, I'm pretty sure that their baked goods are the "BOMMBDIGITTY~" I live on the east bay side and I would drive an hour to get more of this Bi-Rite ice cream! Thanks ya'll! Keep up the good work!

this place is great for the money. where else can you get 2 scoops of organic handmade ice cream for $3.25.  It's kinda of like a gelato place where you can sample the different kinds and then pick the one you want.  Oh yeah, if you want it in a cup it's cheaper. I had a snickerdoodle + cookies & cream. i'm a big of fan of the chunky stuff in ice cream and they nailed it. my fiance had the salty caramel with orange cardamon.  full of flavor and creamy goodness. definitely one of the best ice cream places in town that has unique flavors. there's nothing ordinary about this place.

Yes, I want to wait a half an hour in line for Bi-Rite; yes, this ice cream is beyond worth the wait to me; and yes, I want to add another review to the kajillion others.... A sunny day at Dolores Park doesn't have a better complement than Bi-Rite ice cream (and maybe some friends to share it with). I love the inventive flavors, and the business's commitment to the community and all the other jazz that has already been said within the sea of Bi-Rite reviews.... So, I suggest not reading through them all. Just go try the Creamery for yourself, you won't regret it.

Lot of Interesting Flavors to Choose. Salted Caramel is a Classical Masterpiece.  Most of the flavors I tested were good. Roasted Banana was not my cup of tea. On my 2nd visit, I got the new Magnolia Coffee Porter flavor on top of Salted Caramel. I could definitely taste the beer on Coffee Porter. The Coffee was more subtle. It's light and refreshing like a Lager.  Color was more blonde than brown. But nonetheless a good flavor that isn't too sweet. It's a good contrast to the sweeter and rich Salted Caramel. Get your Ice cream cone and then walk across to Mission Dolores Park to enjoy a majestic view of the City. Smaller Portions but worth the Price. Line can get  long sometimes in the late afternoon and weekends. Parking is kinda tough in that area of town.

I have had ice cream and gelato all over the world and nothing compares to Bi Rite's balsamic strawberry ice cream. It tastes unlike any other strawberry I have ever tasted, like strawberry flavor raised to the infiniti. I also like the salted caramel. I visited Bi Rite after chowing down at Tartine for breakfast...which included a lemon tart...and my friend insisted I try Bi Rite. They were so nice, they totally let me just taste everything, so I had to give in and buy a scoop.

I wasn't sure if it'd be worth the hype, but now that I have been I can say it really was awesome. The brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl is amazing. I had it along with the also wonderful coffee toffee and honey lavendar in a bowl. Extremely tasty! The salted caramel ice cream is also wonderful. It is quite thick and very, very richly flavoured. The mint chip is extremely tasty, but BEWARE! It is *peppermint* with chocolate chips, not regular mint with chocolate chips. My wife was highly disappointed about this because she loves mint ice cream, but not peppermint ice cream.

Your first indication that this place may be good is the long line that always wraps around the corner but by no means let this deter you from enjoying one of the best scoops of ice cream you'll have in San Francisco. The creamy quality deliciousness that is Bri-rite is everyone's quilty pleasure at its best. The flavors are orignal, organic and home spun and savory to the taste buds! The sundaes are a trademark with their homemade cookies and hot fudge sprinkled on the top. If you're not in the mood for ice cream, their upside down pinapple cake is exceptionally tasty but make sure you call in ahead of time because this is a special order. If your going to treat yourself, treat yourself with Brit-Rite

The BEST ice cream I have had...so far. I haven't tried the other highly rated places yet but they're on my list!!! My favorites are Salted Caramel and Coffee Toffee. Coffee ice cream will never be the same for me again (just like my experience after I had a cup of Blue Bottle coffee). Balsamic Strawberry is always a winner. Despite the use of the word "balsamic" there is nothing sour about it. It actually helps bring out the flavor of the strawberries and is very true in taste (unlike strawberry-flavored candy). For vegans, I have seen a Chocolate Coconut flavor. I have never waited in line for ice cream. You should though if you're not in a rush because it is well worth it. **Tip: if you're not interested in any of the exotic flavors of the week/day, they do have a couple standard flavors pre-packed in pints in a freezer. You could just grab one of those without waiting in line. If I remember correctly, some of these flavors were Balsamic Strawberry, Mint Chip, Snickerdoodle and Chocolate. Their sundaes looked enormous and I will make sure I leave enough room in my stomach next time for those.

Being new to the area (and loving ice cream) I had to immediately try this place. One word, YUMMY! However, try and get a sample before you order. A few of the flavors I thought I would love completely underwhelmed me and one that I wasn't too interested in caused an explosion of flavors in my mouth that rendered me momentarily speechless. It's like dating, when you find the right one it just clicks :) The parking may suck, but hey, after visiting here you'll need the walk!

Best Ice Cream In The Bay.  Period. Although it may not look like much, Bi-Rite Creamery serves top quality ice cream.  They make the ice cream themselves on site with organic and locally grown foods.  They also have a bunch of seasonal flavors which change during the year.  Their flavors are also unique and quite delicious.  I suggest going here with a bunch of friends, have everyone order a different flavor, and share!  But be warned, you may go back for seconds, thirds, fourths.... The price is extremely reasonable for ice cream this good.  Although there isn't much room to sit inside or outside, don't let that bother you.  Stand up and eat good ice cream, don't be a princess. I also do suggest trying their sundaes.  Although the ingredients may seem foreign and strange, try them, they put them up there for a reason.  They taste DELICIOUS! Whenever you're up in the bay, after dinner, and still have a sweet tooth, GO HERE.  But be warned, the line on a weekend usually goes around the block, but it does go by quickly.  Bring a jacket.

Ok, Bi-Rite, (btw - am I the only one that thinks of Rite-Aid, every time I say, Bi-Rite?) really small place, which explains the long line.  Also, limited seating inside, but a few benches along the sidewalk.  The creamer-istas' were great!   There were 3 people taking orders that night: 1. A white woman that had so much green eye liner and other make-up around her eyes, it would make Lady GaGa proud!  She was awesome; allowed us to taste almost all the flavors! 2. A Hispanic man, let's call him, Consuelo; short, clean cut, no visible tattoos.  Efficient. 3. A short Asian woman (aren't they all? Haha..jk), she was also great; nose pierced, spaghetti strap tank top, and black wavy hair.  The slutty look.  "Weren't you both just here??" she asked...but we'll get to that in a sec. Now to the ice cream: Salted Caramel & Honey Lavender - not my style.  In fairness, I think it's an acquired taste; if I was forced to eat it, I'd probably end up loving it. Coffee Toffee - I love to drink coffee, not eat it. Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle - Good but not great. Chocolate (not the vegan) - Fantastic; I dare say better than, Haagen Dazs. Brown Sugar w/Ginger Caramel - I LOVE ME SOME BROOOWN SUGAAA!   Overall: They use actual metal-spoons to sample the ice cream & are generous in their sampling portions.  I didn't get any of the sundaes or extra toppings on my ice cream.  If you need more sugared toppings to make your ice cream taste better, how good was it to begin with?   Got 2 scoops, Malted Vanilla & my Broooown Sugaa!  We loved our selections so much we went back (yes, got back in line, cause that's just how we role, son!!) for more!  Got another 2 scoops with Salty Caramel & more of my Broooown Sugaa!  The asian woman behind the counter recognized us; was probably intrigued by my infatuation for their Brooown Sugaa!  Great place and more important, awesome ice cream!!   Afterwards, I had this urge to listen to Beyonce and watch a movie starring Halle Berry.  Hhhhmmm.....

My friend John introduced me to the Salted Carmel Ice Cream.  It was really good so I was destined for a return trip. I came back with my wife. She said her taste buds were making her so happy. Of course the salted caramel was great (just like the last time). The Coffee Toffee had a bold rich coffee flavor. The brown sugar with Ginger swirls was my favorite new flavor.  The Orange Cardamom was a refreshing great combo of flavors. It's not cheap ($3.25 for two small scoops) but the quality of the ice cream and distinctive flavors are worth it.

FOOD: Never disappoints. When I can be convinced to stray from my staples, salted caramel or honey lavender, the other flavors that I have tried have been great. I have to agree with Jon P. and say that if Bi-Rite Creamery were closer to my house, I would weigh 300 lbs! SERVICE: Always great! Even though the line can be daunting, the employees know how to move the line quickly while still giving excellent service. Ever time I have visited, the employees have been very friendly and patient with me when can't decide on what I want.

After the first day I visited (once before and once after dinner!) I had to go back.  I hit B-Rite twice more while I was in town, each time trying something different.  Everything is so good! My choices on each visit: 1) Kiwi banana sorbet (vegan) - delicious. And very creamy for a sorbet. 2) salted caramel and coffee toffee - salted caramel was tasty, but the coffee toffe was even better! 3) brown sugar w/ ginger caramel and ricanelas - both were phenomenal, but ricanelas was the winner. I love me some snickerdoodles! 4) ginger and cookies n cream - cookies n cream was the winner hands down. it wasn't even close. ginger was the only flavor i didn't absolutely love - it was just too flowery for me. Every time I went, the staff were awesome.  Very efficient, but also very friendly and helpful.  Kept the line moving w/o rushing people thorough the selection process.  Awesome! http://www.flickr.com/ph…

Usually when someone describes something as beige and off-white, you'd automatically think, wow, really? get some personality. But if that beige package could deliver a punch of Bi-Rite goodness, you'd be wishing that those colors could define the rest of your life. Go taste some spicy intrigue. Earl Grey and Ginger.

Places like the Bi-Rite Creamery are why I will never leave the Bay Area.  I came here a gazillion years ago from Texas, and I am still shaking my head at how the Bay Area can generate so many occasions of such deliciousness, over and over again.  If there's a bad ice cream place in the Bay Area, I haven't found it.  And there are plenty of great standouts, like Ici, Three Twins, and Humphry Slocombe -- but Bi-Rite Creamery is just out of this world.  The salted caramel ice cream is one of the best things I've ever eaten, and I have taken out-of-towners to get it half a dozen times.   How do they do it?   I hope one day to get my salted caramel craving under control so I can do justice to all the other wonderful stuff they have. And now I hear they have Soft-Serve and that it's fabulous.  Time to haul back into the city -- this can't wait.

With 2600+ reviews, there is not much more that can be said. But I will anyways.... Parking is a pain Ice Cream is good (Salted Caramel is Fantastic, Honey lavender was good, Brown Sugar and Ginger could use more ginger) The price was about right for SF. There was a line, but it did move quickly (quicker than finding parking). The staff was easy on the eyes and happy to help. The ice cream could have been kept colder so it didn't melt so fast, but it was a hot day in the city.

Business at the Bi-Rite Creamery has gotta suck these days with the howling wind 60 degrees or less temperatures all day and night, one of the last things I want is something frozen. Jeeze. There, now I feel better. The ice cream is made with love, tenderness, and the best *&%$ ingredients possible to put in sweet and savory frozen cream products. You think they are saving money this summer on their freezer costs? I am very partial to the coffee toffee flavor. And anything with chocolate in it.

Went here a few nights ago with the hubby, along with his cousin and cousin's friend. It was past 9 pm, and pretty chilly - typical SF night. Mind you, this night was days before the recent heat wave, and yet there was still a line that reached the end of the block. 30 cold minutes later, I finally reach the front of the line. The fat kid in me wanted to try all of the flavors, but in the end I settled for a scoop of the salted caramel and a scoop of the coffee toffee. Coffee toffee, in my opinion was the better choice. Although salted caramel seems to be the majority favorite, it tasted a bit bitter... as if they burned the caramel. Maybe it was a bad batch. Personally I've had better ice cream, but the I'm still intrigued by the other flavor selections. Looks like I'll be venturing out to BiRite in the near future. Hopefully my next experience will be better.

WOW, can't believe I hadn't reviewed these guys.  Learned about this place from my 15-year old niece...and she asked me to take her...and I'm thinking, "Really, an ice cream place all the way in the City...it better be good!"  And it surely was. Pros: * The servers are all cordial and efficient with managing multiple orders...slightly impressive with all of the patrons they get * The servers let you take multiple samples...okay, let's not take advantage here...maybe two to three max is appropriate without pissing off the people behind you * Their samples are served on silverware spoons...not plasticware...Yay, go green!   * The flavors are all extremely unique combinations and prepared from scratch * They offer a variety of toppings, sundaes, baked goods, novelty/popsicle items, sauces and other items for your sweet tooth Cons: * The line outside the door will make anyone who doesn't have 10-20 minutes to spare for ice cream want to pass on this place...however, you will be sorry. * Limited seating inside and outside Perhaps one of the best ice cream places I've been introduced to in my lifetime...no joke.  I am partial to their version of the banana split and have already had it more than a few times.  Next time, I am going to try another sundae called the Berry Sundae. Hope you notice the more than 2800 reviews on this place and swing by...it's delish!

Had the Salted Caramel, Roasted Bananas and Toasted Coconut, and sample the Honey Lavender. Not fan of the Honey Lavender, but all 3 flavor I ordered was a hit. Tasted the sweet and savoriness of the caramel, banana taste oh so yummy, and the pieces of toasted coconut in my ice cream mmm... delicious! Can't wait to come back!

Today was my third visit to Bi-rite and I had to write my review now. This is the best ice cream in San Francisco. Although it's a bit of a trek to get there from Campbell, it was well worth the trip and the (lack of ) parking. I tried many flavors and settled on Ricanelas. My partner went for the salted caramel. We are ice cream crusaders and we were not let down by this fantastic shop. The line sucks though, but that's the price of good ice cream.

I'm usually wary of places that claim to be "the best" so I didn't have the highest of expectations coming here. Well, it turns out that I had no reason to worry because Bi-Rite lived up to its name after all. Although the flavors themselves were very interesting and unique, what I rated for was the richness of the ice cream. I could definitely tell that their quality of ice cream was much higher than that of generic store bought ice cream, or even ice cream chains including Coldstone. That said, Bi-Rite doesn't have the creativity or selection that Coldstone has, but its definitely delicious in a different way.

Seasonal flavors are the best--my faves are pumpkin (fall) and egg nog (winter).  FYI the egg nog is made w/ brandy and if you're anything like me, can actually get you tipsy (esp on an empty stomach). Otherwise I go for brown sugar w/ ginger caramel swirl.  Salted caramel is a staple.  Bi-Rite's ice cream in general is good, but I just don't get all the hype. That being said, if you come on a hot day when the line is out the door and around the block, go straight to the counter and buy a pre-packaged pint.  Bypass the line and feel like a VIP ;) . p.s. I miss Bombay :(

I scream, you scream, we all scream for Bi-Rite Ice Cream!!!  Okay, maybe you don't scream, but I scream "This is sOoOo delicious!!!" as I take each bite...(wipes drool from thinking about Bi-Rite ice cream) I would have not found this place if I didn't search for ice cream on Yelp.  Therefore, I would like to thank Yelp for helping me find the best ice cream I've ever tasted. I've tried numerous flavors here and they are all spoon/carton licking good.  This is the first place where I tried salted caramel and it just melted in my mouth and stimulated all my little taste buds.  The saltiness from the salted caramel and the perfectly sweetened creamy vanilla ice cream provide a perfect balance of flavor.  Each bite just makes me want to continue eating until my sweet tooth is satisfied. You may come here and say "Crap...a line?? Screw that, I'm not waiting in a line just for ice cream..." But trust me and everyone else that has reviewed this spot, the ice cream is amazingly good!!!

Don't get scared off by the line that may wrap around the corner. Just hang in there and imagine what scrumptious flavors may live inside the glorious ice cream shop that is Bi-Rite. I had the May It Yourself sundae with malted vanilla + salted caramel, caramel sauce and whipped cream. Definitely something to split with someone else because can be SUPER rich. I've been waiting to try Bi-Rite for quite some time now. Well worth the wait... and then some.

After living for San Francisco for 22 years, I finally heard about Bi-Rite Creamery from non-San Francisco residents who convinced me to try it. On my first visit, I tried the salted caramel (of course) and the honey lavender.The salted caramel was truly the best caramel ice cream I've had. It was a dark brown ice cream--rich, buttery, and pronounced in the bitter and burnt milk notes. The salt wasn't overdone, but there was just enough salt to accentuate the caramel. The texture of the ice cream was smooth and very creamy, as if they used a creme anglaise base (but they don't...as I've seen from their videos). As for creative flavors, they don't have as many creative flavors as some of the other ice cream shops I've been to, but they do make a very creamy ice cream.

Hot Damn. This place is good. This was my first time there and I guess there is always a line so we knew what we were headed into. Tip - go to Philz up the street and get a cup of coffee, come back and wait in line until you get your ice cream. It took about 20 minutes to get through the line but it was so worth it. I got salted caramel with roasted banana. It was amazing. My friend tried with cinnamon cookie one - also amazing.

Thick, flavor-rich, delicious taste of salty caramel, dense, textured, melting like chocolate, quenching my sugar cravings, very lightly and not overly sweet because it's salty... easy street parking just 4 blocks away, and a single scoop lasted me that entire distance while I walked on this gorgeous sunny day. The worst part of it?... I don't eat ice cream! They made me! They are that good!

Bi-Rite Creamery is probably the most popular ice cream place in SF at the moment.  I've always enjoyed my ice cream there and the assortment of flavors are changing all the time so there is always something new.  The big plus for me is they do not seem to use any extra stabilizers such as gum which for me can distract from the taste of the ice cream.  This for me gives Bi-Rite the edge over Mitchell's. To make the detour to get ice cream here is another question.  It isn't super close to the BART station, but it isn't far and is probably worth the walk.  However, there is almost always a line.  I've been there in the middle of a weekday, and there is a short line.  During busy hours, the line snakes around the corner.  If I'm here with friends, I'll wait.  If I'm not, maybe I would pass if the line is super long.  I'm not sure if it's worth it to make a special trip out here (unless you're from out of town).  However this place is always enjoyable for me.

Salted caramel and toffee coffee...Orgasmic. I've never had more rich and creamy ice cream in my life. Perfect on a warm... Let's just say perfect on any kind of day.

Ricanelas ice cream with bruleed bananas... YUM! IMO, Bi-Rite wins best ice cream in SF (although Mr. & Mrs. Misc is still on my must try list if I can ever get there before they close). Some other amazing flavors to note here would be the Orange-Cardamom, Roasted Banana and Eggnog. This place has a line down the block in the freezing cold so be prepared!

I really don't get it. Thirty minute lines for mediocre ice cream? Granted, the salted caramel is the bomb. But the other flavors are really too bland to warrant the hype. At least it's not super sweet like traditional ice cream. But Bi-Rite has yet to come anywhere near the awesomeness of its northern compatriot, Salt and Straw in Portland.

We went in at around nine p.m. and the place was bustling. It seemed like a really cool vibe. I wonder if it was because of all the traffic that our server sucked. All three times I spoke with him, I was met with a negative grunted response. Also, he had served us the wrong kind of ice cream on our sundae. A fact I missed until much later due to digging through the whipped cream. Boo, maybe try again later. Not in a hurry.

We sample every single flavor until we figure out which one we like, line and all!!! Gotta love bi rite!!! very patient with us as well!!!

In one word this place is "YUMMY"!! I loved the Roasted Banana ice cream and the Malted Vanilla ice cream with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces was awesome too. We had heard good things about this creamery and so my husband and I actually came here before dinner because we were worried they would be closed after we finished dining out. What a good choice that was!! Mmmm...I want more. The only complaint that I have is that the place is really small so going on a warm day is better, that way you can get your ice cream and go to Delores Park.

My dad described it best... "It isn't bad, but it isn't what I'd call good either. It's novel." Yelp's description for three stars is perfect: "A-OK." After dinner with my parents, I suggested we stop at Bi-Rite. My mom is an ice cream fanatic, and after passing Bi-Rite on the bus and then reading about it on Yelp, I was determined to try their ice cream for myself. A group of five was in front of us, but things moved quickly and I appreciated that the friendly woman behind the counter let us try samples while they were making up their minds. The ice cream is extremely rich and sweet. I rarely complain about food being too rich, but I agreed with my parents - this ice cream was heavy, sugary and rich. I believe this is the first time in my life that I couldn't finish even half of my ice cream - and I got a small. I definitely do not recommend stopping at Bi-Rite after a satisfying meal. Like me, you'll probably have to toss half and then feel like a wasteful big spender. We ordered three smalls. My mom got Brown Butter Pecan and Ricanelas (cinnamon and snickerdoodles). She let me try a bite of the ricanelas... It was "just ok," in my opinion, although she said it was "pretty good, but too rich." It tasted slightly like hazelnut, which I hate, and the snickerdoodle bits were really flat and floury - I don't think they started out as very delicious cookies and I'm pretty sure they were stale when they were thrown in the ice cream. (I used to work at a bakery that turned all of their stale goods into nasty "fruit bars" and I can definitely recognize stale bits of cookie mixed into other things.) I tried the famous Salted Caramel and I thought it was pretty good, so I ordered a small half- Salted Caramel, half- Coffee Toffee. I assumed I'd enjoy the Coffee Toffee, because those are two of my favorite things. I was right - it was delicious, but too rich. I ate more of it than the Salted Caramel, but I was nowhere near finishing the scoop. The Salted Caramel was delicious, for the first four bites. Then it was too intense to finish. If I were to order it again, I would probably order a scoop of vanilla with it, to mellow out the palate. The few bites I was able to finish were mostly mixed with the Coffee Toffee. My poor dad had to wait in the car and he asked for sherbet. The helpful counterwoman told us the sorbet of the day was Banana Kiwi. I told my mom that Banana Kiwi is too exotic for my dad, but she ordered it anyways. I was right - he took one bite and said thanks, but no thanks. I sampled it - it was much lighter than the ice cream and the kiwi flavor was nice, but I don't really like banana flavor anywhere except in bananas. The bottom line? Bi-Rite isn't the be-all, end-all of ice cream. It's a helluva lot better than Dreyers or store-brands, but if the choice were between Bi-Rite and Haagen Dazs, I'd choose the latter. If you're looking for truly delicious homemade ice cream, make your own. That said, I love Bi-Rite's organic ingredients and environmentally-friendly attitude.  I will almost definitely make a point to try it again.

OMG!  How awesome is this place!?  The Salted Caramel is everything and then some.  I about a pint to go as well and already finished it... This is about as close to addicting as you can get. The best time to go is just after 3pm when the line isn't too long.  The first time I was here, I just stood there sampling all the flavors.  Ricanelas, Earl Grey, and the Roasted Banana are also my other favs if I don't get the Salted Caramel.  I also had Sam's Sundae before (chocolate ice cream with bergamot olive oil, maldon sea salt and whipped cream) only because I had no idea how sea salt and olive oil would work, but it does somehow.  You have to love how this place takes a weird combination and make it amazing. staff is super friendly there can be a line but not too bad parking is torture, have fun circling around

This place had a huge line and I was told they have amazing flavors.  Three of us went to try it for the first time and each of us chose different flavors then sampled each others.  The quality of the ice cream is great, so I can see the appeal.  The flavor options though were a little too weird for all of us.  The scoops are smaller in size, but then again their flavors are so power packed that a little bit goes a long way.   We prefer Mitchell's, but this place is worth checking out at least once.

*Review is for Sam's Sundae* 7 STARS Was being an old lady as always and was watching Food Network's "The Best Thing I Ever Ate".  Anytime they have bay area "good eats" - I'm down to try it out and Sam's Sundae from Bi-Rite was on there. It was a little over OK but, not oh my god, to die for typa sh*t.  It's some super rich chocolate ice cream drizzled in the not the average olive oil, with sea salt and a whop of cream on the side.  All the flavors together were good but not the bomb - sorry.  Again, 7 Stars! All the flavors together almost tasted like a cinnamon pistachio chocolate explosion but not that awesome fantastic journey to the motherland that I was hoping for. I'm up to try the other flavors though, those looked potentially more yummy!

THis was not good ice cream its pretty nasty i tried the slaty caramel what ever is called and let me tell you i didn't like it at all waited in line for nothing!!!! How can you put something salty in a ice cream hello it sapossed to be sweet!!! Anyways i waited for like 15 min and i ended up getting the banana ice cream that was pretty much the one that tasted ok.! THe reason why i'm giving it a bad score is because I came from the easy bay to taste this ice cream and yeah it was not worth it no parking what so ever and the employers was mean they only let me try two flavor!!!! So yeah I didn't like this at all ! I still got to try Mitchell ice cream and Humphry how ever you spell it!!!  Oh yeah there freakin scoops are small !!! ughhh and its high  price geez

I came in on a Sunday & got myself a sundae.  Result:  best sundae and Sunday OF ALL TIME! After contemplating the various flavors, I set my sights on the sundae selection.  Because the only thing better than ice cream is ice cream with additional tasty things piled on top.   In the end, I went with the Afternoon Snack, which is composed of roasted banana ice cream, graham cracker crumbs, caramel sauce, and a dollop of whipped cream.  Normally, I'm not a huge fan of graham crackers or caramel, but since Bi-rite makes all of their toppings in-house, nothing was the bland, standard-issue fare of your average popsicle stand.  Strangely, both the crumbles and the sauce possessed a slight burnt flavor, which kept the sweetness from being too overwhelming. HOWEVER Minus one star for the fat content and lengthy lines. (But maybe if you waste away in line for long enough, the indulgence would be warranted)

Recently, took an acquaintance that was visiting from out of town. She looked at me and said, "I've never seen a line of grownups for ice-cream before"  but as soon as she tasted the vegan chocolate she understood it is well worth the wait. The flavors are exquisite no matter your mood - salted carmel (best paired with the roasted banana), honey-lavender, creme fraiche, orange cardamom, and amazing sorbets no matter the flavor. While I am not vegan myself and prefer ice-creams that aren't very plain the vegan flavors are incredible and even plain-jane vanilla is anything but. The staff moves very quickly mindful of the ever-present line, are friendly, and don't mind hand packing multiple flavors for you (always quickly) even if other customers are busy glaring at you for not just picking a single pre-packed flavor out of the fridge. I happened to swing by on Halloween this year and got served by the prettiest hipster zombie girl ever, and Hey Arnold which only endears me all the more.

I've gone here twice, and I still don't know what's so special about this place. The reviews are ridiculous for a normal ice cream joint. The ice cream is good, but not great. In a blind taste test, I probably wouldn't be able to distinguish between Bi-Rite and Baskin Robbins. The line is ridiculously long. For the price and wait, I would rather go somewhere else.

Came here for dessert one night on a weekend. Parking wasn't easy. When we got to the store front, there was a line down the block..this was 20 minutes prior to their closing time! We didn't really know what to get so we tried the Salted Caramel, Honey Lavender and Earl Grey. Earl Grey was the best flavor..very light and refreshing. Salted Caramel was a bit too sweet for our liking. Honey-Lavender the taste reminded me of smelling potpourri.. Worth a trip to stop by here! The employees were upbeat and friendly.

Back to five stars for Bi-Rite Creamery. I had to undo the bad juju from the brownie sundae last week, so this time I had a banana split. Dark chocolate ice cream was cheerfully subbed in at my request. The carmelized bananas went perfectly with the ice cream, the syrup and the whipped cream. Yummy yummyness.  Amazing there was a line at 4:45 p.m., just before dinnertime but there you have it. Bi-Rite, you have redeemed yourself.

As a native San Franciscan I grew up on Mitchell's. My parents insisted it was the best ice cream in town so why would we go anywhere else? I finally came here for the first time a few months ago and I felt SO guilty for cheating on my beloved Mitchell's. Two words = salted caramel! Heaven :)

Having already noted Slocombe, Smitten, and Ici plus spending substantial time in the Mission it seems only logical to conclude my comments on San Francisco Ice Cream (for now) with the most famous of all - Bi-Rite Creamery, an offshoot of the lovely Bi-Rite marketplace down the street and yet another purveyor of frozen treats made locally, sustainably, and with Straus Family Dairy milk. Arriving at the small store just short of dinner time I found myself greeted yet again by a relatively short line of about ten and with four folks working the counter it would be perhaps five minutes before I found myself in front of the case being asked not what I wanted to order, but what I'd like to sample as though they read my mind.  Again knowing what I'd come for but wanting to take a couple of tastes I started Balsamic Strawberry and Honey Lavender, the first a slightly tangy take on rich strawberry ice cream and the second reportedly created with organic dried lavender and honey that is gathered in Sonoma especially for Bi-Rite the profound sweetness honey suspended in cream with a faint top note of lavender that perfumed the sinuses more so than obscuring the honey; it was good enough that I almost changed my preconceived order and to an extent I wish I had - at least half of it. Beginning first with the Salted Caramel - certainly Bi-Rite's most famous flavor - the texture was expectedly creamy and the flavor rich and sweet, but overall I have to say it was simply too much salt and not enough caramel.  Having tried myriad iterations of this classic (and still uncertain as to who did it "first") the flavor of Bi-Rite's option fit somewhere between the impossibly smooth and textural Salty Caramel of Jeni's Splendid Ice Cream in Columbus and the Burnt Caramel of Toscanini's in Boston and although excellent it was not as good as either overall.  Moving next to the Ritual Coffee Toffee, however, I found what could potentially be my new favorite ice cream of all time - a dense admixture of Straus and Ritual teaming up to form a perfect latte flavor that was smooth as silk punctuated by crunchy bits of house made almond toffee that was sweet but not overly so, more acting to highlight the creaminess of the ice cream and the slight bitters of the coffee. With a price slightly less than any of the competition I tried and the taste and texture every bit on par or better I can say that overall the Mission is certainly the place to be for Ice Cream these days and while I'll admit my predilection for breakfast foods and sweets in general I can only assume that a scoop of Slocombe's Secret Breakfast and Bi-Rite's Ritual Coffee Toffee would be blissful.

friend-"You wanna try Bi-Rite?" me- I shake my head in confusion "No, No, I've gotten that out of my system early on in my path of sexual discovery. " Then i start in on my feelings on bisexuality.   "Bisexuality is for 16 year old teenagers who aren't quite sure what they want.  Its a way for them to ease into being gay.  Its a stop on the way to gay-ville.  Its a detour on the way to homo-town.  Get it straight, get it crooked, just get it.  !Okay!"  *in my chola accent* Bi-Rite did me right in all the right places.  The ice cream flavors were delicious and executed perfectly.  The crowds of people are proof enough as to why its so popular.  I don't think they need more reviews but I'll say my piece. The flavors I got to try were the salted caramel and honey lavender and creme fraiche and balsamic strawberry. I have heard about the hype of the salted caramel, let others be warned.  Its not for everyone.  I felt it was a little one-noted to me, just a bit bitter and salty.  However, I enjoyed the other flavors immensely.  The honey lavender was probably my favorite of the 4. I wished they had a few more exciting flavors.  I felt like they had the equation and they knew how to do it and didn't deviate from it.  They do solid flavors and do them right.  But where's the attitude? Where's the razzle dazzle? The texture was a notch above most ice cream stores.  There always seems to be a texture issue at some ice cream places that I have beef with.  This was ice cream done right.  It held its shape, it didn't melt lightening fast even though it was hotter than Hades outside, and it didn't have a gummy texture like some places.  It had the perfect creamy consistency without being overly so.  The texture is almost like thick icing but cold. I'm giving them a gold 5 stars because they did it right.  Go, Go now, and bring me back some!

The salted caramel is a MUST!!! I wanna go back just to get this one. Also tried the maple brown sugar and the coffee with toffee bites. All was good, but the salted caramel was just so creamy and delicious!

VEGAN ICE CREAM!  Y'ALL BITCHES BESTA RECOGNIZE!!! This place is so fucking good that i ate here twice today.  i got one scoop and ate it on my walk home, got home, took off my pants (don't ask), was like, "fuck it.  i've had a long, hard week of overindulging in food and drink to the point of adult onset diabetes so clearly mama deserves a TREAT!" and then got right back on the road again.  i wanted this shit so badly that i walked all the way down the hill on Church st. (okay??) in the rain without an umbrella (it's not that i don't have an umbrella.  i have many, in fact.  it's just that i am hard core, you see.  UMBRELLAS ARE FOR WEAK LITTLE GIRLS!!!).  Anyway, I get there and the Bi-Rite dude is all, "what's up, vegan girl!"  and i'm like, "you know how we do!  holla!"  and then he's basically like, "for real?" and i'm like, "FOR REAL." all dead serious with the look of the kill in my eyes.  I get my second scoop of the day.  and also a soda pop.  and perhaps also a third scoop whatever fuck you laura is the boss of laura and if laura wants three scoops of ass sticking soy cream and wants to cry on the scale at weigh in tomorrow morning then that's what laura wants.  I AM ONLY SO STRONG, PEOPLE!!!   Anyway, after three scoops of ice cream, I head back up the hill on Church street.  Now, for folks who aren't familiar with this peak...let me paint you a picture.  It's called, Everest.  Look it up and then imagine a beast ten times worse and covered in the stench of dog and human piss and also, men to your left having sex in the bushes off of Dolores Park (hot!).  Do you know what it's like to hike back up that cliff with nothing to shield you from the harsh winter elements?  I was like the motherfucking kids in Alive, setting up base camp and then threatening to cut and/or eat fellow pedestrians.  I am lucky to be here today.  Thank GOD I have the extra seven layers of fatty protective coating.  I was smart to carbo load at Bi-Rite before scaling that thing.  Can you imagine a Yelp site without me?  You're like, "Yes bitch, leave" and I'm all, "Hey buddy, fuck you!  Didn't you read the part where I said I'm the boss of laura?!?  Bitches, please."

The roasted banana paired with the ricanelas is magic. Was a lil' disappointed I missed out on the meyer lemon flavor this time around; will have to wait until next year. That's all my fault, though. What else can I add? I've gone through all the signature flavors except 5 and this is truly as good as it gets. Ice cream that is more delicious than this cannot be had.

Bi-lieve the hype people! When three of my favorite Yelpers, Ciara G, David G, and Michelle T give an establishment a 5 star review, you better bi-lieve it will be an amazing place. Bi-Rite Creamery is a San Francisco legend. I swear that not a week goes by where I don't see a new review or review update on this wonderful ice cream parlor by one of my many Yelp friends. I have had it bookmarked for well over a year and last week I finally had the privilege to indulge in Bi-Rite's tasty treats. Bi-Rite is a tiny joint, located in the mission district of SF. No matter what time of day you visit Bi-Rite, rain or shine, this shop will never be empty. The night I stopped by was a cold, windy night and there were still six people ahead of me. Their menu was packed full of delicious sounding ice creams and sorbets. Not to mention Popsicle's, ice cream sandwiches, baked goods and ice cream cakes and pies. Since it was my first time I sampled many of their flavors. This is what I sampled: Toasted Coconut Honey Lavender Roasted Banana Balsamic Strawberry Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces Every one of these flavors was freaking fantastic, especially the Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces. I would have to agree with David G, who said that this flavor is "the greatest ice cream in the history of man". I remembered that both Ciara and Michelle had mentioned the Sam's Sundae in their review, which is a sundae that consists of two scoops of chocolate ice cream, drizzled with bergamot olive oil and sprinkled with Malden sea salt and a side of whipped cream. It sounded wonderful except for one element, the chocolate ice cream. Don't get me wrong, I love chocolate ice cream, and I'm sure Bi-Rite's is too die for, but with all their unique flavors I felt that I needed something more exotic than plain chocolate. I decided to create a modified version of Sam's Sundae using the Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces ice cream. The guy who made my sundae said it wouldn't be good, the guy who rang me up said it wouldn't be good, hell, even I thought it sounded strange. But guess what, it was phenomenal. I have never tasted a sundae that tasted as beautiful as my modified Sam's Sundae. This sundae had so many levels of yumminess. It was sweet, salty, tangy and creamy all at the same time. It sounds strange but trust me, it was fabulous. I also got a balsamic strawberry ice cream sandwich made with sugar cookies. It was also really, really good. The prices and service here was great. Even though there were a bunch of people in front of me, the line moved quickly. I don't remember exactly how much I paid for my two treats but I know it was not over ten dollars. In all honesty, I would have paid ten bucks for my modified Sam's Sundae alone. Trust me when I say that it is a must that you try Bi-Rite at least once in your life. If you don't Bi-lieve me then just ask Ciara, David or Michelle, they will tell you to Bi-lieve the hype that surrounds Bi-Rite.

Again, I rate this place 3 stars just to alleviate any of the haterade messages I may get for actually giving this place the rating I'd LIKE to dish out. I also completely realise that, by now, the ninehundredth review for this place means so very little. BiRC  (somehow) garnered features in magazines left and right, tv shows, and the hype continues to live on, much like James Cameron's epic feature from 1997. I don't *care* if there are lines out the door on any given warm weekend in SF. I don't *care* that celebrity XXXX *adores* your ice cream (wait, i don't even know that to be true.) On a weekday evening, we show up.. at about 10 min shy of closing. The manager (?) is literally SHOVING the door closed, trying to make SURE that no one ELSE makes it through the doors so that they serve not ONE more scoop of ice cream after the clock ticks 10. It's a birthday, so we're in the mood to share a banana split, which sounds just perfect. We request the icecreamista, "is it ok? can we order a banana split? we know you are closing soon", and HE FRICKIN rolls his eyes at us and obliges. Hang on. it gets better. We realise that the banana split states that the ice cream is "vanilla", but we're feeling mocha-y at the moment, so we tell him. Hm. SEEING AS HE HAS ALREADY started scooping the vanilla, he PROCEEDS TO SCOOP The vanilla ice cream INTO the bowl, and then scoop 1/4 of a scoop of the flavor we actually ASKED for. During all of this, of course, manager-man is YELLING at the door person to close/lock/whatever the doors so that no one else attempt to give him precious american greenbacks for his ice cream. Y'know what? I'd soooo rather go elsewhere for ice cream if I have to deal with that kind of crap. Hell, if it weren't a birthday I'd have just gone to Safeway. Any business owner who has SO VERY little gratitude for his customers has no business taking MY money, I'll say that much. Reminder to the owners: The Neighborhood made you what you are, and the 'holier than thou' attitude that you seem to hold towards your customers can quickly snap back at you and take away all the hype that you have created for yourselves. **** And yes, I have been here more then just this one time, but this particular occasion just put the cherry on the proverbial sundae top. WAIT A FRICKIN SEC... I realise.. I just paid almost $7 for a sundae... and it did not even HAVE a cherry on top! What the hells. Get thee INSTEAD to: Scoops in LA... OMG yum... sooo good.... Joe's Ice cream on Geary (my absolute SF fave) Bombay Ice Creamery right down the street on Valencia Ici in Bezerkeley (holy hotness while you're waiting in line, just ask Elin  F.) Oh, and for the record: THIS is what a REAL banana split should look like. http://imagecache2.allpo… For a little under $7, we got 1.25 scoops of ice cream and i would venture to say, 1/4 of a banana. WTH!

After noticing the opening of Bi-Rite's new sidewalk bakery that operates next to their ice cream store, I decided to swing by to have a closer look into their display case which was filled with cookies and cupcakes along with an impressive listing of soft serve ice cream posted on the wall. After catching myself staring at these gorgeous looking cupcakes for way too long, I decided to bring a White Chocolate Cupcake ($2.50), Picnic Cupcake ($2.50), and Salted Caramel Cupcake ($2.50) to share with my good friend and fellow Yelper Angella S. The White Chocolate Cupcake was my favorite as the dark chocolate cake had good moisture when layered with sweet white chocolate butter cream and a coat of dark chocolate glaze. The Picnic Cupcake was very rich and bolstered with lots of pecan and chocolate chips with chocolate fudge frosting to cover a dark chocolate cake deliciously mixed with sour cream. The Salted Caramel was Angella's favorite as the yellow cake was airy and a tad dry that depended on salted caramel filling at the center to give a definitive taste while the vanilla butter cream on top was a delectable add on. Overall, prices were decent for these cupcakes when compared to those at similar boutiques. With the exception of Salted Caramel Cupcake, the other two shared the common thread of rich taste, solid moisture, and full body finish. The ones with sweet fillings inside were particularly enjoyable and added a nice touch of moisture of which was distinguishable instead of repetitive from the creamy frostings. Service was quick, friendly, and knowledgeable. These were not the best cupcakes I've had but it was good to see the ways in which Bi-Rite has continued to expand upon their repertoire by introducing new products while maintaining their edge in defining what good ice cream is all about.

Who knew that salty caramel could rock my world in such a way? Well it did and I'll never be the same. If all men could figure this out perhaps there wouldn't be so many sexually unsatisfied women and the world would be a happier place? Or maybe if a guy can't figure it out he should just buy his lady some salty caramel soft serve from Bi-Rite! Went to Bi-Rite with my friend Crystal for some after shopping sweets and it was so worth it! I had heard about Bi-Rite so many times from friends and when I saw the line that extended around the block I knew that this had to be good as legend had fortold. My friend had to get back for another meeting so instead of standing in the very long ice cream line, we stood in the shorter soft serve line. I'd much rather have ice cream than soft serve but I was willing to suck it up as we were short on time. To my delight their twist soft serve of the day was chocolate and salty caramel. We ordered two giant cones and began licking our hearts away as we walked back to catch the BART. I've tasted happiness but this was a different level. I'm so glad I got a twisted cone because it was so fun licking back and forth between the two flavors. We walked through the Mission, looked at the locals walking their dogs and kids and I thought, "It just doesn't get any better than this!" I'll be back for more Bi-Rite and am now a huge fan of their phenomal salty caramel.

This place is all right 7 bucks for what would be considered a "love it" cup from coldstones creamery. I got the banana split. They used a flame to Caramelize the banana which was very unique to me. It gave the banana an unexpected hard candy taste. Workers are nice. They put a whole shit load of whippitdacream that fooled you to think you got your money's worth. Which cost them their two stars. 70% of my banana split was whipped cream. :( tear.

I went to Bi-Rite Creamery for the first time a few weeks ago, after doing a community service clean up at Dolores Park.  If anyone's been to Berkeley or is from around there, and has been to Ici, this place is exactly like it!  The ice cream is home-made and the flavors are not only imaginative, but bomb.  I ordered a scoop of Earl Grey (MY FAVORITE) and a scoop of Burnt Caramel (YUM) on a cone.  The only improvement I'd have for this is to add chocolate at the bottom tip of the cone like Ici does, otherwise, Bi-Rite is a must-go for ice cream.

what do you do when you're having a blah day?  i either participate in gluttony or impulse shopping...it ALWAYS works...as i was having a blah day on tuesday...i wished there was a bi-rite near by so i could consume a vat of the ricanela (cinnamon with pieces of snickerdoodle) ice cream... it's been almost a month since i've been to bi-rite and with one trip, i am hooked...and going through withdrawls... i must have sampled almost half the flavors... http://www.yelp.com/biz_… some of their ice cream flavors include (flavors change): vanilla                                                         roasted banana salted caramel                                         balsalmic strawberry chocolate                                                   brown butter pecan chocolate coconut (vegan)                     malted vanilla with peanut ginger                                                              brittle and milk chocolate mint chip                                                         pieces honey lavender                                         brown sugar with ginger coffee toffee                                                   swirl earl grey                                                     toasted coconut cookies and cream                                  creme fraische ricanelas in the end, the salted caramel and ricanela won... http://www.yelp.com/biz_… http://www.yelp.com/biz_… i have to say...the salted caramel was extremely good (would have been better if the saltiness came through a little more assertively), but ricanela has to be my favorite...and i don't even like snickerdoodle??   their secret:  they sprinkle a little crack on top of each scoop ;-)

This place has awesome Ice Cream in the Mission Area of San Franciso. I think it is much better than Humphrey Slocombe in the same area. It is a small place and there is always a line, but it's worth waiting for! They have unique flavors and they all taste so great. Every single flavor I tried was yummy. I was able to try Balsamic Strawberry, Salted Caramel, Malted Vanilla, and Roasted Banana. Salted Caramel and Roasted Banana were my favorites! You gotta try this place!

after mitchell's we went straight to bi-rite. i like bi-rite but not as much as i like mitchell's. bi-rite is good and the ice cream is rich & creamy. I wasn't too big on the honey lavender flavor, it was too floral - tasted like i was eating a soap, in my opinion. Which also shows that it has a very strong flavor  - so for those who likes lavender, you may want to order a scoop. the salted caramel was interesting and i like it. But i really like their coffee toffee. my goodness it was bursting w/ coffee flavor! it was really good.

I am going to review Bi-Rite Creamery without actually stepping foot into the ice-cream parlor and here is my story. We decided to try Bi-Rite Creamery because of the raving reviews on Yelp.  We were driving along 18th Street trying to find the creamery and saw Bi-Rite Market.  Silly us thought the creamery was in the market so we drove around the block to find parking.  We went round and round and no parking.  Finally we got fed up and stopped the car right across from the market.  We decided to have RF stayed in the car while I went to get the ice-cream.  "Be sure to get the salted caramel ice-cream," RF said.  I walked through the market and discovered there was a plethora of fresh organic goodies.  I went straight to the back of the market thinking there was a ice-cream counter there.  Turned out there was no ice-cream counter but there was a really large freezer with cartons of Bi-Rite Creamery  ice-cream.  The pint size looked good so I grabbed the salted caramel pint.  A pint of ice-cream was not cheap...$8!  I made the purchase, sped out of the store, hopped into the car and drove off in lightening speed into the sunset.  On the way out of the Mission mayhem, we spotted the actual Bi-Rite Creamery.  Oh crap but oh well. That night we decided to have the salted caramel ice-cream for dessert.  I dug the ice-cream scoop into the ice-cream and my goodness it was the most creamy ice-cream I had ever felt.  The taste...was worldly delicious!! The caramel had a deep flavor, it is hard to describe.  It tasted like actual homemade caramel with a hint of burnt sugar and the salt really added to it.  The texture was so creamy and I felt as if I was in caramel heaven.  I am addicted.  I cannot wait to go back to get some more salted caramel and try their Honey Lavender.  Bi-Rite Creamery ice-cream is awesome! I am here to announce that Bi-Rite Creamery's Salted Caramel ice-cream is my ice-cream of choice.  I am Mabel Y. and I approve this message.

Umm, hell yeah.  This place is simply amazing.  All the yelp reviews have been right on. The salted caramel, lavender honey, ginger, cookies and cream, etc...all fabulous. Yes, so I sampled almost every flavor but I have become a bit indecisive and it allowed me to taste all the yummy goodness.  I ended up with mint chip.  And we are talking real mint essence, not neon green mint, and it came with big chunks of chocolate.

ice cream at dolores park is an automatic three stars. when that ice cream happens to be the bi-rite ginger ice cream, it warrants the coveted five stars! true to its reputation, bi-rite appears to hit a home run with the creamery. after one lick of their ginger ice cream, i was sold. it is most delicious, and has that strong ginger kick to it. yelpers, if you don't like ginger, this is the ice cream for you, and if you do like ginger, this is the one you have been yearning for.  *sigh*  of course, bi-rite creamery also offers a wide range of other flavors to blow you away. so jaunt over and satisfy your ice cream craving here. then take it to dolores park and get blown all over again, as you savor your ice cream and admire the majestic city view. ahhhh, we live in a very special town. . * all bi-rite ice creams are organic, and the cups and spoons are biodegradable. nice.

Amazing place, if there's one place that I think that's better than Scoops in LA, this is it, and it's no contest, really. Part 1 of 2 of the ice cream tour in SF: Bi Rite One Word to describe Bi Rite: Amazing! Pros: - Honey Lavender (probably my favorite ice cream to date) - Salted Caramel (Awesome) - Brown Butter Pecan (Mmmmmm) - Tried a few other flavors, and they were all really good. If not for the drive back to LA, I'd have bought a few pints back home. Cons: - the wait/line?? (However, it was only about 15mins for us, so it's not too bad) Honestly, Bi Rite is amazing, one of the best, if not THE best ice cream I've had to date. I'd easily wait a hour for this if I have to as the flavors and tastes were amazing. Unlike Humphry Slocombe, Bi Rite actually delivered and I was happy I came here after HS as I didn't care too much for the flavors there. Keep up the great work Bi Rite as it definitely lives up to all of the hype!

On our way to Tartine to keep the food-freakfest going, I spotted Bi-Rite from the corner of my eye.  I had heard the rumors of their deliciousness on Yelp, but here I was already full from Monk's Kettle, on our way to Tartine to have a sweet indulgence, and oh why Lord why did you have to put Bi-Rite in my way?!  As we passed by I noticed several people sitting outside with ice cream sundaes.  "Cripes in 40 degree weather with the wind blowing up a storm they're eating ice cream?," I said to myself, "Its gotta be good!"   Needless to say, the guys and I got something to go from Tartine and headed straight to Bi-Rite to satisfy my sweet tooth jones.  The rumors of Bi-Rite's orgasmic flavors, oh yes they're true.  Roasted bananas and toasted coconut were my choices and my friend got the toffee coffee.  A testament to the deliciousness of their ice cream:  my friend's New Year's resolution was to stop eating ice cream.  Shyea right Bi-Rite broke him of that 2 days into the New Year!! Due to their graciousness and willingness to put up with our fat asses we also tried the creme fraiche, ricanela, honey-lavender, salted caramel, brown butter pecan, and other forms of ice cream crack that I can't remember.  One word:  scrumdiddlyumptious.  I usually like a denser ice cream with less air whipped in but how can you complain - its so good, once it hits your lips its so good!!  The different flavors we tried were all nicely balanced too, not too sweet, and with a good ratio of unadulterated ice cream to whatever goodies were mixed in.  Bonus points for being able to choose two flavors when you order a single and for their other delicious wares.  I brought home a Bi-Rite Rocky Road chocolate bar (dark and milk chocolate, housemade marshmallows, and almonds) and best believe that was the best $6 candy bar I've bought in a loooooong time.

Ahhh-ma-zing ice-cream. That said, finding parking was very hard. I came by on a Friday night around 10pm, to find a line of 20+ people, and after driving around the block a few times, I gave up and decided to come by the next day. Next day: Better, less than 10 people lining up, but still had to circle around the block three times before finding parking. (Please excuse the sidetrack, but not being able to find parking sucks when it acts as an obstacle between you and delicious ice cream.) Now back to the good stuff, ze ice cream. I had Salted Caramel, Honey Lavender and Coffee Toffee. All three flavors were strong and distinct in their own ways. The staff was very nice and patient during my mini break down due to the dilemma of having to choose between all the flavors. All in all, just as I expected, I LOVED the ice cream. Will be coming back to sample more flavors, and fingers crossed, I will have better luck with parking.

RICANELAS! Or as I like to call it, "Rica-Slap-Yo-Mama-nelas", cuz it's sOoOoOo good; it'll make you want to slap someones mama! I swear, I come here every other week just for Ricanelas. I don't even bother to wait in that ridiculous line anymore. For what?! Just bypass the line and grab a pint because it's soOoOo good, you'll just end up killing the pint in one session anyway. Not to mention the difference between a single scoop and one pint is about $4.

Great place to come after eating at Delfina right down the street.  Their scoops are very generous, one scoop is actually two and you can choose two flavors if you want.  I always get the coffee toffee whenever I come here.  It tastes like vietnamese dripped coffee in ice cream form.  The line hasn't been too bad whenever I come here, it goes by pretty fast even with people trying flavors.  The only downside is parking can be a little difficult.

Something happened since I first visited this place a year ago! Last time, we went right in and took our time sampling flavors like toasted coconut, banana, plum sorbet, and coffee toffee. But this time we waited in a line that stretched all the way around the corner, and by the time we reached the counter I couldn't say "1 scoop-chocolate and cookies n cream in a cone, in a bowl" fast enough! Even though I was rushing and the counter was packed, our ice cream-scooper took the time to talk to us, as how we were and carefully pack scoops into my cone. The cookies n cream was amazing, with big chunks of cookie (that must have been home made, because it didn't taste like Oreo) hidden in the cream and was reasonably priced at $3.50....mmm....Bi-Rite is on my permanent list of places to go every time I'm in SF!

OH. MY. GOD. I don't really know why i'm bothering to write a review for this place because i can't really say anything that hasn't already been said. I've had Bi-Rite in my bookmarks for quite some time now, ever since i saw it featured on "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" on the Food Network. My friends and i came on a Friday afternoon before heading over to Dolores park to get shwasted. When we got there, there were only like 4 people in line! :):):) Fuck yeah. I hear all these people talking about how they waited 30+ minutes in line and such and i can't believe we lucked out. I was all set on getting Sam's Sundae, which is chocolate ice cream, bergamot olive oil, sea salt, & whipped cream, but when it came down to my turn and i saw all of the other delicious flavors, i couldn't resist. I had to get the Coffee Toffee ice cream, as well as the Ricanelas (cinnamon w/ snickedoodles), and holyyyy shit. I WISH i got a large. It was so good. The pieces of their homemade toffee and snickerdoodles are what pushed me over the edge. All of the people working were reallly nice and not trying to just rush you along. Oh, and a couple people have mentioned in their reviews how they don't like that they use metal spoons for sampling...it's to help save the environment. Think of how many little plastic spoons Bi-Rite probably goes through in a day. ALOT. It would be such a waste, not to mention harmful on the environment to be so careless with throwing away so much plastic everyday. I'm pretty bummed that i have to wait allll the way until i'm back in SF to come here again. I'm even willing to wait in the long ass line next time if i have to.

News flash!  Bi-Rite Creamery is the new drug of choice for hipsters in the Mission district.  Crack is out, ice cream is in.  Salted caramel, honey lavender and peanut butter fudge trouble our dreams and beckon hauntingly at any time of the waking day.  Often times we are engaging in an important activity, such as shopping for groceries or watching TV, and suddenly we find ourselves standing in the Creamery, money in hand.  Our eyes are glazed, skin is pallid, until the first bite.  Aaaaah.  Sweet, sweet surrender.

even though i've only have been to bi-rite less than a handful of times...and have probably sampled at least 15 flavors, i still love the vegan strawberry kiwi sorbet and the earl grey ice cream. i ordered a birthday cake here recently (which i would highly recommend)... the bi-rite rep was very helpful with choices and i ended up getting a ricanelas ice cream cake with midnight chocolate cake and a whip cream topping.  you can choose almost any flavor ice cream (except the ones that are too soft and sorbet) to make into a cake and have it with chocolate or vanilla cake, topped off with a chocolate, whip cream, or butter cream topping!  order by phone so you don't have to wait in line!

So after leaving Humphry Slocombe (see last review), we had to go to Bi-Rite Creamery. I wanted the Salted Caramel, she wanted to try it for the first time. Unanimous decision: the quality and flavor of the ice cream here was far superior to that of Humphry Slocombe. How about that for some instant comparison people? There's a reason why Bi-Rite has a line, and Humphry Slocombe doesn't. *Buuurp* And I'm telling ya, the culinary excellence of the burps that Bi-Rite ice cream yields is unmatched!

This place always has a line out the door and down the street and around the corner, but I'm not sure how many of these people are in it for a scoop of Salted Caramel. If they are, it's available at the window next door that sells soft serve. Doh. This is a review for that line. We got a scope of the hard packed salted caramel and a swirl soft serve, and I'm sure it was delicious as it was eaten rather quickly by some very already-full patrons, but I have made ice cream at home and I'm not sure this is the best. I came because I was in the area, but I wouldn't make the drive or walk from upper SF to seek it out.  Maybe next time I'll suck it up and stand in line and see if there's anything better, but for now, a 3 star rating will do.

I've lived in the Bay Area my entire life, and I rarely visit unknown places to me, but my friend Diana recommended this place after one of her friend's told her about it. We made our way to Bi-Rite Creamery, and when we got there, there was no line, as we were standing there I noticed an Ice Cream sign, and we realized we were standing at the Bi-Rite soft serve, so after trying a sample of the salted caramel soft serve the lady recommend we try the ice cream next door. I tried the salted caramel there too, and decided to have a scoop of that until Diana tried the white chocolate with raspberry swirl and after trying a sample of that too I was convinced to get both of them. I have to say the ice cream there is pretty good, and I'd go back there again to try out the other flavors they offer.

the best ice cream i've ever tasted. (and it's kind of a pet peeve of mine when people say that!  one time a girl told me this restaurant in hawaii had the FRESHEST fish ever... really??  like freshest in the whole world?  like fresher than the restaurant next door that sourced from the same fisherman?  like fresher than pulling out lobsters from the atlantic ocean and hauling it into a restaurant on a pier in maine 5 minutes after it came out of the ocean?  like fresher than getting fish at the tsukiji fish market and cutting it right there on the spot to eat sashimi?  i can understand freshest fish you've ever eaten, but freshest fish ever?  sorry, ish don't think so.  anyways, i digress...)   i'll preface it by saying, in my opinion, this place truly rocks out of this world ice-cream!  my family tried the salted caramel, coffee toffee, candy cane and roasted banana ice-cream.  everybody thought it was delicious.  my 5-year old son was so enamored with his ice cream that as we walked by the open door of the store when we were walking to our car, he peeped his head in and said "you have the best ice cream ever!"  tell us how you really feel, son... :)

bi-rite is luscious, delightful, heavenly even... but ici in berkeley is better. don't agree with me? fine, the cheese stands alone. look, i know bi-rite is fantastic; 2554 of you think so, and i can vouch that it was absolutely dreamy on a hot and sunny saturday at dolores park. i had the balsamic strawberry and the salted caramel and both were really, really good. but my 5 star review goes for ici, which is sheer perfection. ici has the clever and original flavors of bi-rite, but with a creamier texture that this SF spot can't top. if you love the flavors of bi-rite, i guarantee that ici has an even better one. think the salted caramel is good? try ici's rosemary caramel - it's out of this world. like the balsamic strawberry? check out the brandied cherry. bi-rite has earl grey tea, ici has green tea. bi-rite's cones are organic, ici's are organic AND hand-rolled. i'm sure there are plenty of city snobs out there who can't fathom the idea of an east bay venue besting a city site. and yes, bi-rite is bigger, has a more extensive menu, and is certainly more well-known. but trust me; if you really love ice cream, i mean crave-it-in-the-night kind of love, you want to go and taste this. venture to berkeley. try ici. thank me.

The salted caramel is really good and so is the brown sugar. Went they melted together it became from cool to dammmmmmmn! The line is always hectic so be prepared to stand for a good 15 min. Dont be discouraged cuz they dont rush you when you are at the counter,  so dont be afraid to ask to taste a few. i suggest you buy the double or the triple cuz its so good you will eat it quick. But savor it at the park across the street.

so we came here on a random weeknight and there was still a line out the door.  people were crouched next door licking their ice cream cone.  we thought we found a spot but the mini cooper in front took up too much space.  hello mini drivers, other people dont drive minis.  so we had to be quick we saw that if you were picking up a cake or take out pints you could skip the line so i went to the frige and got 4 pints: salted caramel, honey lavendar, coffee toffee, and roasted banana.  no i did not get to skip the line.  i think people got mad at me. i heard the market across the st actually sells them too without the lines or ppl getting mad the people behind the counter are super friendly though.  i heard them telling customers about flavors.  about how you can have 3 flavors in 2 scoops.  which really was 3 mini scoops. they also have sundaes like afternoon snack (roasted banana ice cream, graham crackers, caramel) and almond joy. ice cream sandwiches.  i saw pies in the freezer and ice cream sanwiches there too. my 4 pints came out to $38.  but when we got home they were the perfect consistency to scoop.  all the flavors were really good.  simple, not too sweet.  i was imagining if i was the dessert chef at a restaurant i would want to make ice cream like this.  imaginative flavors but very simple, pure ingredients for a clean, memorable taste.   the case had some other flavors i would like to try.  balsamic strawberry.  but i guess i will have to wait until i finish the four pints!

stopped by to meet some friends, who luckily were already waiting in the rather long line so we hopped in with them. employees working behind the counter were awesome, made good suggestions and helped the line go by quickly. ordered two flavors in one cup: the salted caramel and the malted vanilla. the salted caramel was really yummy but i couldnt finish it. it got to be too much for me, not sure if it was the salty sweet combo (that i usually like) but i couldnt eat it all. the malted vanilla however i couldnt get enough of. mmm mmm had some nutty taste to it and a bit of crunch also. super yummy. wish i could have traded the rest of my salted caramel for more vanilla. overall a great experience. interesting flavors, helpful staff. a little cramped space cuz it was busy but nbd. would def come back if i were in the area. :)

In the past the line has always been out the door and down the block and I've never been able to get ice cream here because of that. Today there was almost nobody. I walked right in and took a look around. It was like seeing a parking place while passing through a busy area and thinking you should grab it just because. I felt I should eat ice cream before lunch today, just because there was no line at Bi-Rite Creamery. 5 stars because it could be a reason to quit my job or take a vacation.

I believe there are two categories of ice cream joints- the kiddy kind and the adult type, which I base on the flavors and ambience of the establishments. Bi-Rite is hands down the best of the adult type I have ever had. The reason is simple- the flavors are wonderfully unique and not too sweet. Flavors such as earl grey, lavender honey, and balsamic strawberry make this joint wonderfully gourmet and a destination worth adventuring for the sake of ice cream perfection. This is in contrast to a kiddy place, which I am not opposed to, but has a menu full of mainstream flavors and a sugary sweetness that can be overwhelming like mint chocolate, rainbow sherbet, or cookie dough. I can always manage to find these flavors at my grocery store, so I like to eat out of the box when I'm adventuring for food.

I've been here several times, and the icecream is beyond compare. BUT The service was appalling on my visit last night. I asked for 2 tastes of flavors I had never had before, and the server said he had run out of spoons, so i settled on my old time favorite salted caramel. well, what do  you know, the person behind me asked for a taste and the very same server (named Andre) miraculously produced a tasting spoon and proceeded to give everyone else on the queue tastes. i asked why, and he said it was because they were new customers i didn't quite get that rationale as 1. i hadn't mentioned i was an old customer and 2. why does a regular customer deserve any less courtesy than a new one? I was hopping MAD. and am going to call the manager to complain. But i must say the salted caramel ice-cream is a like scoop of salty heaven.

So tasty, and I love how you can just walk up to a window on the street, get your soft serve or cupcakes, and roll out. For those in the "know" Bi-Rite is one of those legendary ice cream places, where people literally stand in line for an hour, just to have a scoop. Which is why you should hit up the soft serve window. Get in, get out, get going. Yum!

holy femoly, 1615 reviews already! but i have to say, i will gladly add my five stars. BELIEVE THE HYPE, friends! i've been meaning to go here for a long time but never seem to make it to the mission, and i'm glad we were there at a time when the lines were minimal (i can totally imagine them snaking out the door). monday night at 7:30 PM it was only two or three people deep. i would, however, gladly wait in however long a line there was. so yes. it was so good i had to go back in and get another cone. cone 1: salted caramel + honey lavender. cone 2: brown sugar + ricanelas (cinnamon  with snickerdoodles) well hot damn. you don't get a big scoop but i like how for the price of a single ($3.25) you can try two flavors (so two smallish scoops). y'all, you MUST get the honey lavender. such a great, refreshing flavor for warm (and cool) summer nights! the salted caramel does not taste salty as the name implies, and the brown sugar and ricanelas were both also good (i got the first scoop of the tub so it was loaded with snickerdoodle pieces -- yum!). there is a very small bar seating area inside, but ample seating on benches outside on the sidewalk. the people behind the counter were very pleasant and you can't help but pick up on the fact that the customers eagerly licking up the creamy goodness (oh my, that sounds gross) there were in a sublime mood. a wonderful, magical place! p.s. umm, there's no official free wifi there but my phone managed to pick up a signal from someone's unsecured router...(because as we all know, at&t is teh suX0rs in the city. major GRR).

there will a come a time in your life when global warming will attack earth (notably, san francisco/east bay area) and someone will owe you an apology, and if by chance those two events collide and happen to land on the same day --- consider yourself the luckiest girl in the world! that is, if you're a smart grudge-holding princess who has saved up many days of apologies for one special treat. dig deep in their apologetic sympathy pocket and seek penance in ICE CREAM! if you come on a weekend, you may have to save up for this sweet reward because you may need someone to drive in circles as you wait in line. (weekdays have always been easy for me though). i was not excited about waiting in line, i have waited in that line of tortune known as mitchell's ice cream (100 tickets behind!) but i can say with confidence that even on the hottest weekend day, the line will move fast enough here. the excitement will build up as you are in line, i even made friends with the two girls behind me :). since the store is tiny, make a decision and get out fast. don't be the a-hole in the front of the line holding it up tasting all of the flavors, if you were smart like me and my-newly-made-girlfriends, we tippy-toed when we were about the 5th group in line to check out the flavor inventory of the day so we could order and get out of there. and if you were EXTREMELY smart, you would have ordered every flavor you wanted. because you should. they are all DELICIOUS! to date, this is the best ice cream i've had. i LOVE their ice cream, it's almost like gelato, it's refreshing/light and extremely flavourful. mint choco chip is my favorite ice cream flavor, and bi-rite's version is the best i've ever had. their salted caramel lives up to the hype, as do all of their other unconventional flavors. my favorite is the nectarine sorbet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! take your treats and walk over to delores park for a cute afternoon of ice cream, spf55, and lovelovelove. I LOVE BI RITE! FOREVER!

Good, but not THAT good. It was hyped up a lot, so I was expecting more. The line was pretty long, but it went by fast. I wanted to try all the varieties, but I always feel bad for asking. i tried two flavours & my sister tried 1. I ended up getting the double scoop of roasted banana & balsamic strawberry. the banana was good; anything banana is always good in my book! the strawberry was good, but i did not taste a hint of balsamic. it just tastes like regular strawberry ice cream from haagen daaz (which i think is good!)

It's 10:45 on a Saturday morning - and we will be having ice cream for breakfast... hopefully! I am writing this review now in a shameless attempt to be the first to give a REAL review of the Bi Rite Creamery, which opens in just 15 minutes.... hopefully! You see, for the time being, I have to give this place only minimal star(s) for having promised to open so many times only to disappoint. For instance, a couple of weeks ago, three of us walked some five breathless blocks, up hill and down hill, having heard that the long awaited creamy cousin of the Bi Rite Market had opened just a few days earlier, only to be disappointed yet again. Then, this place was rumored to be opening last weekend, and again we waited in breathless anticipation. What's the hold up? Who knows - just open the doors, already - if this place is even only half as delicious as the Market across the street, it will be a raging success. So, off we go for breakfast and, upon my return, I will give give a "breaking news", "hot off the press" review of ice cream for breakfast! SO... now  it's 11:45 and we are back and... what can I say? Yes it was open and yes it was fabulous. I pigged out on the seasonal sundae (pumpkin ice cream, gingerbread cake, caramel sauce, candied pumkin seeds, and whipped cream) and the Missus had a single scoop of salted caramel ice cream and a lemon ginger snap cookie on the side. We are both ice cream snobs and ginger snap officinados, but all of these were indescribably delicious, delicate, and complex. We were the second customers to be served and all the charming and slightly nervous staff were out front waiting on our every word and gesture. There was a palpable sense of intrepidation and excitement as they hung on our every word. We discussed the ins-and-out of salt in ice cream, made the appropriate (and genuine) ooohs and ahhs, and wished them well on their can't-miss venture. If they can keep the quality as good as opening day and the lines shorter than Tartine, they will surely be opening a second creamery before long... opening date TBD! 5 stars, for sure!

Wow. Yelp did not disappoint on this one. Salted caramel == good, but not as good as Ritual's coffee toffee! Coffee toffee == Supercalifragilisticexpialidoceously GOOD. Brown butter pecan == as good as it was, I couldnt eat more than a spoonful since they actually use REAL butter in it! roasted banana, and minthill honey lavender == very interesting flavors Soy chocolate == I would avoid this one. The regular chocolate is better.

Yum!!  Lately, everyone has been bringing up Bi-Rite to me, even a friend who doesn't live in the bay, so I knew it was time for me to try it out.  We came here for dessert and it was so close to closing time and there was still a line out the door... but the line goes fast because there were 3 people scooping.  I love the idea that the single is actually 2 scoops and you can get two flavors... I got Mint Chip (which is always my favorite) and Balsamic Strawberry... both were so goood.  My husband had the coffee toffee and he wasn't expecting it to be so good... after his first bite.. he was like OMG! this is SO GOOD! lol i thought it was cute.

My friends Jillian and John brought me here (not forcefully by any means) last night after dinner. We had been discussing how I had lost weight last week because I had gotten sick. In an effort to regain the weight that I had lost, Jillian suggested we go have some dessert at Bi-Rite. Approaching the place, there was already a visible line of people outside, about 10-15. Thankfully the line moved pretty quickly as I had already decided what I wanted to try. At the last minute, Jillian asks me "wanna split a sundae?" Normally, I wouldn't be a fan of sundaes, but I said what the hell; sure. We ended up ordering a brownie sundae with 2 scoops of ice cream. One was the balsamic strawberry, and the second was the salted caramel. Never in my life would I have thought that those were a good combination, but I was very surprised! The salted caramel was delicious, a little rich but went really well with the brownie and cinnamon(?) pecans. But then, I took a bit of the strawberry to finish it off...and it was an amazingly refreshing taste that didn't feel heavy at all. So, I've decided to at least come back a couple more times, as a way to not only satisfy my taste buds, but also to add on some extra poundage so my friends don't start calling me anorexic.

This ice cream is SO, SO good! The balsamic strawberry and salted caramel, when mixed, combine to create a party in your mouth. A party that you don't want to end! It's truly the best I've had since I've been in the bay area and trust me, I've tried a lot of ice cream shops out here. Bi-Rite comes highly recommended from me! Let me know when you're going, I'm sure you'll need company in that long line! :P

What can I say that hasn't already been said about the salted caramel? It's delicious? It titillates the senses? It's worth the (usually very long but goes quickly) wait? I have less willpower to resist it now than I did when I lived half a block away? All true. You probably already know this, but get one scoop salted caramel and one scoop Ricanelas OMG.

I guess I'm not enough of a hipster yelpster to enjoy waiting 30 minutes for a $5 cone of turnip-radish ice cream.  I love ice cream and ice cream should come in flavors like chocolate, strawberry, peanut butter cup, etc.... How about a "sundae" of olive oil and salt...what the fuck?????? Even the "normal" flavors are not all that great. I know y'all love things just cause they're "different" and "only in San Francisco", but this place is stupid. I'll stick to Mitchell's Thanks

Our friend Brenda took my bf and I to Bi-Rite (our first time!!) today, a gorgeous, sunny Saturday.  The line went all the way to the corner, but it moved surprisingly quickly even though I know people ask for multiple ice cream samples.  I tried the Balsamic Strawberry and the Roasted Banana - hmmm!  But I had to try the famous Salted Caramel - ok, so I got the Balsamic Strawberry and Salted Caramel in a cup (I'm a spiller), and mmm!  It was so yummy, so creamy, soooo good as everyone else has said over the years.  The girl at the counter was very friendly and smiley.  I will definitely be back!!  Thank you, Bi-Rite!

A great place to take your SF foodie girlfriend who loves real foods and rainbow market but other than that...it's just aiiiiiiight. I felt like another typical SF touchy-feeley organic blah blah blah food place. The ice cream was good, but definitely not worth the 25 minute line. It's definitely better than Dreyer's/Breyer's but I could just go to Walgreen's to get some dulce de leche Hagen-Dazs.

Holy macaroni.  Thank you Yelp for directing me to this hole-in-the-wall on my most recent trip to the Bay.  I am eternally yours. The line wasn't as ridiculous as feared, but I suppose we did go after dinner in January.  We still had a good five or ten minutes to plan our orders, but no standing around the block. I have to say, service was fantabulous.  I'm a huge pain in the ass when it comes to ice cream shops.  I have to sample at least three flavors at a fucking Baskin Robbins before making a commitment, so imagine how insufferable I am when I'm looking through a glass displaying flavor names that take time to read.  I sampled the chai spiced milk chocolate, the riconelas (cinnamon and snickerdoodle), and the creme fraiche.  I didn't want to sample too many more, so I narrowed it down to the malted vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate and the brown sugar with ginger and caramel swirl for my last sample.  I did this out loud to my friend in line ahead of me.  When I asked to sample the malted vanilla, the server handed me a spoon with both the malted vanilla and the brown sugar on it - she had overheard, and instead of being irritated at my request for a fourth sample, decided to give me everything.  I almost asked her to marry me. Since I don't live in the Bay anymore, I decided to do Bi-Rite right - my friend and I went family style.  He got three scoops - roasted banana, chocolate, and honey lavender.  I got four - salted caramel, chai spiced milk chocolate, malted vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate, and creme fraiche.  Together with the rejected samples (which were oh so hard to reject), that makes nine flavors, and every single one was absolutely delicious.  They were all very deep, distinct flavors, and I'd be hard-pressed to pick a favorite, but I suppose if I had a gun to my head, or if someone were threatening to take my Bi-Rite away from me, I would go with either the malted vanilla or the salted caramel.  I was scraping the bottom of my four-scoop cup.  If only I could be a regular, the lovely servers could watch me as I came back night after night looking more and more like a blissful balloon.

well, geeze, i hope i could help this place out by doing 1 more review.   bi-rite is very well known but the line moved quickly.  it is NOTHING like an LA food trend which I just can not tolerate.   everyone in line was polite & civil.  the employees were efficient and quick.  it was a relatively painless process.  when i heard we were going i was worried i was going to have a "Pink's Hotdogs" or "Sprinkles" (both located in Los Angeles) experience where you wait in line for hours for over priced, mediocre food. not bi-rite.  the ice cream was rich and unique in flavor.  i got the single scoop of creme fraiche & brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl with dark chocolate topping.  my only regret is not ordering a TRIPLE.  :D

The honey lavender is DELICIOUS and sooo refreshing and light, that it seems almost more like sorbet than ice cream. The basil is surprisingly good. The salted caramel was not a yummy as I had been hoping it would be... it tasted more like very burnt creme brulee. But overall the ice cream here is pretty excellent.

last night was the best ever!!!!..because i had the most glorious, heavenly, luscious organic ice cream!!!! i had a kiddie scoop (which accdg to the board: for kid's only!, but the guy at the counter gave it to me anyway..so that was super cool!) of SALTED CARAMEL and it was very, very, very delicious! on the other hand, my companion had the MALTED CHIPS RICE KRISPIES..and of course, i have to have a taste of it, so i had a lick (he didn't mind) and yet again, it was pure heaven!. though organic, it was surprisingly full of flavor. both of us was so happy...furthermore, you could purchase their pre-pack ice cream, ice cream sandwiches, cookies, banana splits, sundaes, cakes, some  organic chocolates and their wonderful varieties of toppings for your ice cream, such as, mocha, orange, chocolate are also available for purcahse. NOTE TO SELF: go to bi-rite creamery after work to buy: 2 bags of TOFFEE CHIPS COOKIE, 1 pre-pack of SALTED CARAMEL and 1 ice cream sandwich in COCONUT WITH CHOCOLATE.

Five stars seems a bit extravagant, especially compared to some of the other places I've given five stars. But four just doesn't seem enough. So the fives have it. We went here on my birthday after reading numerous Yelp reviews and articles praising its virtues. And it was pretty damn good. It was a Wednesday evening and there were only a few people in line in the store (we didn't have to wait outside -- yay!). I had to get the Salted Caramel after hearing so much about it, and it was definitely good. Not super strong on the flavor necessarily, just really creamy and sweet, but yes ... a slight saltiness could be detected, though I'm not sure I would have noticed it if I didn't know the name of the ice cream. My other flavor was the Ricanelas -- cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodle cookies. I'm not even hugely into cinnamon anything (except a giant, gooey cinnamon roll, perhaps) or snickerdoodles, but this ice cream was fab. My fiancee got the Coffee Toffee and it was delicious and full of flavor. He also got the malted vanilla, which I personally thought was good, but not my thing. I would totally come back here sometime, I just don't get out to this part of SF regularly. But I'm sure we'll make the trek again sometime. We even considered taking some home, but figured it would be mostly melted on the near-hour drive home so just voted to be happy with the single experience. Yum.

After hearing the crazy hypes for this place, I had to try it. Luckily, it was completely empty when I came after lunch at Ike's. I really liked Ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodle) as well as the honey lavender. The popular salted caramel was a bit too strong for me. It tasted a bit too burnt or something. I love the richness of the ice cream and the unique flavors they have but at the same time, sharing a small was more than enough for me. I'd recommend trying this place for sure and it's in walking distance of Ike's so will make a great dessert afterwards.

My favorite dessert! Everyone compares this ice cream to Mitchell's, and now the holy trinity includes Humphry Slocombe.  Mitchell's is good with tropical flavors, whereas Bi-Rite has better creaminess.  Humphry slocombe has very unique flavors. I've decided this place is my favorite.  Love the creaminess of the ice cream.  Salted caramel is worth every trip here.  The key here is the roasted effect of the caramel flavor. Even in cold weather, I still come for the powerful rich bold flavor the cinnamon and snicker doodle (ricanela) is good too.  brown sugar with ginger is interesting the line goes outside in 40 deg weather -- you know this place is worth it!  try salted caramel with coffee toffee (so rich), or combine with butter brown pecan also adding spiced pecans can be nice, but can overwhelm the ice cream flavor -- but if you get a single with topping, they put it in a bowl, so you get more ice cream i still love this place and recommend it all the time the sundaes have 2 scoops of ice cream catch the club like line up outside on weekends?  place is still going strong now has suggested combos -- i still like the coffee toffee with salted caramel such perfect contrasting of strong flavors (always consistent).  love it after all these years.

I used to think ice cream was the most boring-est dessert ever, but I think Bi-Rite has changed my mind. The malted vanilla and the salted caramel were SOOO goood! Definitely, the best vanilla ice cream I've ever had. I think I would be content with sampling all their flavors, since I'm not a big ice cream person and I couldn't even finish one cup. But for all the ice cream lovers out there, this is a must try. It even made walking 4 blocks in the pouring rain worth it.

I usually stay away from caramel ice cream because it tends to be too sweet for but this one isn't - maybe because there's salt in it? Well, that's my scientific analysis!

Despite the lines and the smalls scoops, this place has to be the best ice cream spot I've been to. Their flavors are so unique that they sound experimental, but they are delicious.

I'm an ice cream fanatic, so I've had ice cream from lots of different places.. but Bi-Rite is the BEST BY FAR. I tried their malted vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate pieces and their snickerdoodle flavors.. and it was DELICIOUS. Two scoops just wasn't enough.

Mmm, salted caramel tasted exactly like perfectly roasted marshmallows.  I also tried the balsamic strawberry, creme fraiche, coffee toffee, honey lavender, a ginger one that I don't remember the name of, and roasted banana.  They were all good, but I wasn't really feeling the honey lavender.  It was a bit too fragrant.    I usually don't like all things ginger, but it was very light and yummy.  Standing in line always sucks but for Bi-Rite, it might or might not be worth it, depending in your mood.

Honey Lavender ice cream= NOM NOM NOM! One of the best flavors by far. I am not much of an ice cream person because it is often too heavy and overly sweet, but this flavor was perfect- not too sweet or heavy. Writing this review is making me crave it now. Though this flavor was awesome, on my second visit I decided to get a sundae and it was so overwhelmingly sweet and heavy that I got a tummy ache =(.

The long wait did not deter me.  Neither does the parking.   The wait turned out to be 15 minutes, which is perfectly acceptable given that it was a Sunday afternoon and everybody is just looking for a little pick me up between lunch and dinner.   The parking turned out to be 2 blocks away, only either through my own sheer luck or the kindness of the SF Parking God.   Apparently legend has it that there are only two Bi-Rite flavors that really matter: Honey Lavender and Salted Caramel.  I tried them both before ordering and here are my verdict: 1) Honey Lavender: the taste reminded me of hand soap from Bath & Body Works.  I kid you not - I'm sure a lot of people swear by it but, to me it didn't taste like anything but soap.  Sorry. 2) Salted Caramel: a definite winner.  See below for further explanation. So I ended up with a two-scoop cone of Salted Caramel and good ol' Cookies and Cream (based on the expectation that nobody could ever mess that one up).   The Salted Caramel was the more famous of the two, being #35 on 7X7 2010 Big Eats SF: 100 Things To Eat in SF Before You Die and I can see why.  I wouldn't be surprised if they stole the trick from certain maker of bad (yet good!) sugary cereals a la Frosties and Froot Loop: adding NaCl actually enhances the sweetness of sucrose.  Like a drug, the salt / sugar mixture in Salted Caramel was the one that made people keep coming back for more, and definitely was a direct catalyst for the ice-cream flavor's fame.   Otherwise, for those who are looking to be a bit more adventurous, Bi-Rite isn't really the place to be.  Their other flavors, like Cookies and Cream, are great, but unfortunately not special.  Definitely not 15-min-wait-or-more special.  Think the likes of vanilla, toffee, chocolate, mint chip, butter pecan, white chocolate with berry swirl, and strawberry.  In short - flavors you can find at your nearby WholeFoods or even (heavens forbid) Safeway.   The adventurous bunch would instead be better off going to Humphry Slocombe a mile away (Strawberry Candied Jalapeno, here I come!!!).

If there's an ice creamery with a better location than this place, you'd have to show it to me. It's small-ish yet they've got a sizable amount of mixed and standard flavors. Looks like their stuff comes from actual happy cows at the Straus Family farm which explains every scoop's velvety organic richness. My toasted coconut made the walk/bus ride back to work memorable.

I couldn't think of the right words to say to review Bi-Rite with until I read someone else's that said it took his breath away.  Holy god.  In Los Angeles, all we have is Scoops.  Nothing else compares.  Thank goodness for competition, because in San Fran there are more than a couple amazing creameries.  I tried the salted caramel, which tasted like they must've cooked the butter/sugar mixture to the perfect brown, because it was like I was licking the top of a brulee'd Plugra.  Heaven help me.  Thank goodness I'm only a visitor in this city, or I'd try to marry the place.  The honey lavender is brilliant, too, but in a way that's edible...sometimes flowery or herb-y ice cream flavors can feel more like experiments than perfect marriages (I've had tarragon ice cream at an upscale restaurant that was less than awesome).  I love you, Bi-Rite.  Come home with me.  At least for tonight...

kneel at the altar of butterfat, my friends: this is old-fashioned ice cream with a pleasing glimmer of perversity.   my favorite: a sundae consisting of chocolate ice cream, bergamot, sea salt and olive oil.  yes, you read that right. olive oil.  Tastes MUCH better than it sounds.   The way I see it, the invention of this dish can only mean two things: 1) the olive oil will unclog those arteries you're busy filling with flavored butterfat, canceling itself out perfectly.  The disease and the cure in the same spoon. 2) our civilization is becoming terminally decadent and will soon collapse, like Rome's. if option two happens in our lifetimes, we're in for a hell of a ride.  might as well enjoy it. for the fainter of heart, they have a lemon ice cream cookie sandwich (between two ginger snaps) that Ari Gold would sign.

Who doesn't like Bi-Rite? Bitter people who hate good things, I'm guessing. Bi-Rite doesn't need another killer review, but I'll highlight my favorite thing about it: the soft serve. I like ice cream as much as the best San Franciscan, but the salted caramel-vanilla twist is my addiction here. Not only do you rarely wait more than a minute or four at the froyo side window, but you also get your pick of stellar toppings or popsicles if that's more your thing.

I'm never too full for ice cream.  I'm like the ice cream monster and can't even have the stuff in the house because I'll wreak havoc on a pint.  Thankfully I don't live closer to Bi-Rite because I'd be super poor, super fat and super cracked out on Bi-Rite's ice cream.  Bi-Rite's honey lavender is wonderful but their Dapple Danny Pluot sorbet was not as flavorfull as I'd hoped.  Which was mildly disappointing since these days I'm a big fan of pretty much anything involving a Danny.

Forget the sublime salted caramel, ginger or rocky road with almonds ice cream flavors. Don't get me wrong, the ice cream is truly a treat. However, my advice is to go for the exquisite hot chocolate. It's literally heaven in a cup. I've been on a quest for the best hot chocolate in the Bay Area and I believe Bi-Rite is in the number one spot to date.

I don't get all the hype. The ice cream is just so-so. They do have a lot of fans though. There was a constant line out the door the whole day. If you're in the neighborhood you should try it and judge for yourself. Also, there are some interesting flavors just not a lot of them. The coffee toffee had a gritty undissolved instant coffee taste and the Meyer lemon wasn't the least bit sour (not even one *pucker*).

Came here on a Sunday evening and it was packed.  There was a long line out the door.  Waited in line for about 15min.  I got a chance to look over the menu and yelp reviews to give me an idea on what to order since it was my first time.  I got to the front and tried a sample of the honey lavender and salted caramel.  I didn't really like the honey lavender as much.  Kind of felt like I was eating a flower.  The salted caramel was delicious so got that in a single.  So creamy.  Definitely worth the wait.

I am not much of an ice cream fan that is why my good friend badgered me to come try to this place. Bi-Rite Creamery is definitely one of a kind. The line forms well around the block and good luck finding parking because the park across the seat is a big hit in the city. Also, beware for there is no reception/3g around that area so waiting in line was a lot harder than expected. I really commend this place for having such unique flavors and combinations. I was able to taste a few flavors, ricanelas was one of my favorites, which was ice cream mixed with snickerdoodles. I also had the malted vanilla with peanut brittle and balsamic strawberry which was a little off for my taste. According to reviews and friends, next time I will try the salted caramel and roasted banana! And Bi-Rite also goes eco friendly with rewashing tasting spoons, yay for the environment!

ok.. looks like there is a million reviews on this place so I will keep it short and simple... this place rocks my socks off. FANTASTIC ice cream!!!! Salted Caranel- I guess I'm not the only one who loves the combination of sweet and salty!!! The Salted Caramel... geeeezus, you couldnt ask for a better creation. The ratio of sweet to salty, on point. If i had a tub of that it would be devoured in seconds. Balsamic Strawberry- good, not as spectacular as the salted caramel but still delicious. IMO its just strawberry. i didnt really taste anything out of the ordinary, just the fact its got a bit more of a tart taste than the norm- reminds me of raspberries. Creme Fraiche- who in the world would think this would be an ice cream flavor? YUM!!! Honey Lavender- good, not as good as the hype, but still good. I just kinda felt as if I was licking my lotion. Its good, but possibly an acquired taste.   Despite the 5 minute wait in line, this place is really worth the wait! Single scoops you can get 2 scoops with 2 different flavors!! it helps to come with friends so that you can all try something different. Just dont come with people who only want chocolate or vanilla.

There's probably not much left to add to this Bi-Rite review page, but I imagine that their recipe for salted caramel involves sugar, butter, cream, rainbows, unconditional love, a child's laughter, and that satisfying feeling you get after blowing on a dandelion.  It's just magical and good and probably how God intended ice cream to taste like.

I loved their salted caramel but disliked the roasted banana and coconut (overly sweet). They do allow sampling They also have decent baked goods like chocolate souffle cakes, toffee cookies, and chocolate chip cookies.

It's almost as if the people at Bi-Rite Creamery had bugged my phone and were listening during one of the many times I raved about using brown butter since reading this article in the San Francisco Chronicle (http://www.sfgate.com/cg…) because, when I stepped inside, what did they have but Brown Butter Pecan ice cream.  If you like brown butter, I highly recommend that you try it in ice cream form.  Bi-Rite Creamery may have tapped my phone, but, when the result is this delicious, I wholly condone it.

Bi-Rite's ricanelas ice cream is perfection. Walking around San Francisco with a cone of BiRite ice cream makes for a pretty rad day. Even more rad is having breakfast at Tartine and then walking your gluttonous ass over to BiRite for ice cream. True story.

there are so many good ice cream places around, and bi-rite had been hyped quite a bit, but we joined the long line anyway.  seconds turned to minutes, and every person that walked by caused me to salivate like one of pavlov's dogs.  after what seemed like an eternity, we were finally faced with bi-rite's amazing choices.  eventually we ended up with salted caramel, banana, and a "yummy sundae," which consisted of lemon ice cream, caramel topping, whipped cream and gingersnaps. well, slap me silly and call me sally - bi-rite is AMAZING!  the flavors were so precise, but not overpowering, and the texture was oh so  creamy.  this is my new favorite ice cream place, and i am certain that i will be back again and again and again... (even though it means a bottle of lactase and toll every time!)

i know you're all wondering why my review looks so...so yellow. i'm a rarity here, floating in a sea of red stars. you see, i'm an east bay loyalist. berkeley bowl over rainbow, lake merritt over gg park, and ici over bi-rite. one thousand times over bi-rite. bi-rite just can't hold its own in a spoon-to-spoon showdown with the college ave. mecca. it's good ice cream. it really is. but its missing that "omg" element that i've found in every bite of ici ice cream that i've consumed. and i've consumed quite a bit. i had the strawberry balsamic which wasn't very balsamicy at all, and the cookies 'n cream, which was quite average. i'm also adamantly against the wooden spoons. i'm so distracted by the splinter potential and the dull, earthy taste that i find it difficult to appreciate the ice cream. i would go back, but only if i'm in the area. snaps for plenty of seating.

With a webpage that has "salted caramel" cached in every paragraph, 400 reviews and 4.5 stars, I decided to jump off the bridge with everyone else.  One of my best friends Christina Y. came along because we thrive on Yelp and bookmark everything and go on Yelp excursions (you can join if you want!) and then write nasty reviews of our favorite places because we're such selfish hoes. Upon arriving, I'm that irritating person in line who just HAS to try everything and then takes an extra 10 minutes to decide what to actually buy.  From what I've tried, the Chai Chocolate and Mint Chocolate were tasty, Nectarine was tasteless, and Strawberry vinaigrette was just OK.  On the other hand, salted caramel was everything I had hoped for and more! =))))))))))))))) I didn't only see the bottom of my cup all cleaned up and SCRAPED up, but I ended up seeing my jeans.  Oh dear, it was time to buy another scoop. I would have to be reading the book "Skinny Bitch" to deny coming back for Salted Caramel. My only dispute: ice cream should not melt faster than sorbet.  In this case my salted caramel melted and drizzled over my frozen plum sorbet (3.5 stars) after less than 5 minutes.

When you see a long line stretching out from a small shop, especially when it's for ice cream, you begin to make wild remarks like, 'There MUST be crack in this,' or 'This HAS to be the ice cream that Chuck Norris fancies,' or 'Is THIS the ice cream finally worth robbing for?'  By reflex, I had to have the not-so-common flavors: salted caramel, ginger, and honey lavender as they would usually pose the most challenge on my taste buds.  Mind you, I was in an altered state that increases appetite, and what doctors call these days as having 'the munchies'; so ice cream, by default, was smooth and decadent.  So good that it's worthy enough for me to experience infinite brain freezing!  Ask the Abominable Snowman, a nasty critic at heart - he's the one who referred me to this spot.

Went here on Saturday after a Giant's game with my man. It was his birthday and he read about Bi-Rite in GQ and was determined to make it down here after our delicious dinner at Gracias Madre. Fortunately they are right in the same neighborhood so we just mozied on over. I try to follow a vegan diet so I wasn't as excited as he was. When we got there the line was fairly long and they try to divide it on the sidewalk so that the line doesn't take over. It didn't take longer than 10 minutes of waiting and we were inside! David got the Roasted Banana and the Salted Caramel (alotta hype surrounding this particular flavor). Needless to say he was stoked and loved both flavors but definitely seemed to favor the caramel. There was one vegan option and I decided to jump on the bandwagon and got it on an organic sugar cone (awesome option!). It was Chocolate Coconut. Honestly I probably wouldn't have written this review if I hadn't got ice cream but this was one of the best vegan ice creams I have ever had!!! It tasted liked chocolate soft serve and I was so glad that I decided to get it. I would definitely change my review to 5 stars if they start offering 1 or 2 more vegan options so that I could maybe get two scoops or change it up.

Long lines everyday. Came here during a Monday night and it was still crowded! As most reviewers mentioned try the salted caramel. I'm not a big fan of caramel, but actually it is pretty good. Pretty rich in flavor. I also had minted chip and that tasted as suggested. Unique flavors and make sure you get a stamp card. Eat enough of their ice cream and you can get a free one. Woo hoo.

i went to this place when it first opened and it was not as popular as it is now, and i have continued to go because my friends like this place. (i'm not the biggest ice cream fan.) the balsamic strawberry tasted different than a year ago. the flavors were bolder and the balsamic really enhanced the natural flavor of the strawberry. today, the strawberry took a back seat to the balsamic and overall, it lacked strawberry flavor. the salted caramel on the other had tasted better than 3 years ago. it was kind of salty and sweet without a strong caramel flavor so i had no idea why my friends liked it. today, i tasted brulee much to my surprise. the texture was denser and had a similar consistency to peanut butter but less sticky.   their seasonal pumpkin had a nice blend of spices and a bold pumpkin flavor. it was better than mitchell's.

I love their ice cream! I always come here right before it closes and they're really nice to let us in last minute! My favorites are the balsamic strawberry, salted caramel, and lavender honey! There is always a line when I am here, whether it be right before they close for the night or any other time. There isn't a lot of seating inside, but there are benches right outside. Mission Dolores Park is also right across the street!

Ice cream is pretty much my favorite food. I might, as a joke, consider giving up pork for ice cream, but I never joke about giving up ice cream. Bi-Rite makes very good ice cream, wow flavors, crazy person sundaes, and enough cookies, cakes, candy & cocoa to make someone else question getting the ice cream. I'd give it 4.66 if I could. Salted caramel!

I feel like a fatass at Bi-Rite, not because of the gargantuan amounts of ice cream one could potentially consume here but because of the fact it's so crammed inside and you're bumping into everyone-- you feel like you've got elephantitus AND Roseanne's cankles.  But really, after you realize you've just been towed, there's really nothing else you can do but go get an ice cream sundae.  Or maybe that was just me.  Salted caramel, yes please!

This is a place I initially avoided because of the line that is always spilling out the door, but it's worth the wait, which actually goes pretty fast. Although Mitchell's still has the creamiest, most luxurious ice cream, I honestly prefer Bi Rite. They offer such adventurous yet amazingly well-balanced flavor combinations. The salt caramel really is the star here. It's incredible- salty and sweet and slightly smoky; very intense. I disagree with Tom about the honey lavender. My sister and I thought they did a really good job of balancing out the honey and lavender flavors so that it didn't taste too soapy or perfumy or sweet. It was simple and perfect, if you like the flavor of lavender. The brown butter pecan was too rich for me, but I don't like butter pecan much in general. I had a taste of the milk chocolate chai, and I'm definitely getting that next time. Or the balsamic strawberry...... They also have several innovative sundaes, such as one with chocolate ice cream, bergamont olive oil and sel gris. I don't remember the prices exactly, but they're reasonable: a bit over $2 for a small, and about $6 for sundaes. and their ice cream is so rich and flavorful I've always been very happy with a small. I suggest going with friends so you can all try lots of different flavors.

Haven't been here in several months, but when I did, it was great ice cream.  I liked the honey lavender and the lactose free options (chocolate and fruity).  Date was really into the salted caramel, which to be honest, I prefer my caramel without the salt.  I prefer a true gelato place to a creamery anyday, but this is a sweet spot.

I was taken to this place by a dear friend who suggested that we get some ice cream to top off our great day yesterday. Bi Rite is this cute little shop with lots of unique flavors I would of never though of mixing together. I finally settled for the Sam's Sudae that had the tastiest chocolate and rich whipped cream drizzled with a flavored olive oil and sea salt. Of course me being a nut lover and all I ask to add some toasted almond which made it heavenly. I suggest if you haven't been there yet you need to give them a try!!!

YUM! i also like the roasted banana & earl grey! plus the people here are really nice! i remember my first time, we couldnt decide on what to get & the guy was really nice and let us try different flavors even if there was a huge line behind us. so that was nice! if you want to impress someone on a date, or someone from out of town is visiting, TAKE THEM HERE! everyone i introduced to bi-rite absolutely loves it here. so you wont go wrong! forgot to mention that at night, there is always a line, so be prepared, if you wanna avoid the line, go during the day on weekday. then you'll walk right in!

I tried the Salted Caramel, finally. And to my surprise, it was what people said it was.. but just a bit salty for my liking. Though I got it with Vanilla which complemented the taste of the Salted Caramel. I'm not a big fan of Strawberry but their Balsamic Strawberry is fairly good. Their portions are a bit small but that's good enough for me, I rather have that then a huge scoop that will lead me to obesity. One of my professors is vegan and he said he'll check this place out, so good for Bi-Rite for catering to vegans too. I visited during one of the many hot days that San Francisco had recently, and to my surprise.. no long wait. And it's super convenient for those who appreciate nice weather in San Francisco and decide to go to Dolores Park. Parking sucks though.

Seems like most people always talk about how crowded this place is but I somehow slipped in during a twilight zone empty hour. Got a solid scoop of Ginger Ice Cream. It was pretty damn tasty. The guy working was talking about crystallized ginger candy and I'm like "I formally request to have that as a topping or integrated into the ice cream itself. Now that would be killer." Being in total agreement with me, I think I might have convinced them to make a customer induced suggestion :) 4.5 stars

If you knew me (which you don't, but you might, just a little, if you continue reading), you would know I have an issue with lactose.  Well, actually, to be more accurate, my stomach has an issue with it, but that's beside the point.  I love Bi-Rite because they have an amazing soy chocolate ice cream (I guess it technically isn't ice cream because there's no cream, but you get the idea)!  Anyway, the location can't be beat if you are looking for a little place to duck into after spending a few hours at Dolores Park or if you are just looking for an evening venue.  The workers are friendly and efficient, which is a good thing because the line is more-often-than-not stretched out the door and down the block.  Trust me, its that good.  Oh, and for those of you that can handle the dairy issue, check out the salted caramel ice cream ~ it is supposedly amazing.

Ok, I thought the pot de creme was great at the Bi-Rite, but the salted caramel ice cream at the Bi-Rite creamery across the street is just ridiculous.  I mean, how can anything taste that good?  I used to think I could only eat ice cream in the summer, but here it is, December and I'm freezing my ass off and all I can think about is that ice cream...and the berry sundae I should have had.  You make me not give a crap about my ass.  Or the wallet.

okay listen, i've been pretty depressed lately. i don't want to get into it.

I came here after many recommendations from friends. I bought a pint of the SALTED CARAMEL, BANANA, and ROCKY ROAD. Let's just say I want to live in a tube of the salted caramel ice cream, it's so flavorful and creamy. The rocky road was sooo good, with little bits of homemade marshmallows and almonds! I usually don't like rocky road ice cream, but this one is awesome. The banana was "meh," I felt cheated for spending $7 on it. However, the other two flavors made up for the banana's short comings. :-P

Once again I may be the dissenter in my opinion, the traitor in your midst...but I just didn't find Bi-Rite Creamery to be that extraordinary.  It was 9:30 p.m. on a blustery night when I decided to make an ice cream pilgrimage, my first outing to this seemingly holy place.  I walked right in, no line and decided on the ginger.  It was nice and gingery but too sweet, I immediately felt my blood sugar level spike (yeah I know sugar is a key ingredient in ice cream)....I may be back again for some of the recommended flavors.

I've tried honey lavender, ginger, coffee toffee, and cinnamon ricanela, tastilicious. An added bonus is Delores Park, where the hot men gather and dogs are adorable.

i almost don't want to write this review. that is how good this effing ice cream is. i don't want to contribute to the lines, but y'all need to know totes for serious. y'all don't even know. the salted caramel is like an explosion of heaven and joy all over my mouth. i got it on a cone and it was  so good i bought a pint. and at 8 bucks a pop, that is saying a lot. i understand that the higher price of organic ingredients and the artisan craftsmanship blah blah blah contribute to this, but i don't really care. honestly, i would pay $15 for a pint of this gold. just don't tell them that.

Me gusta mucho! I guess it was worth the 20 minute wait in line in the  freezing cold (okay, below 70 is freezing cold for me. hey, i'm from la). i had the coffee toffee. it was very rich and the toffee bits were a great addition and surprise. there weren't huge distracting chunks, but small pieces that were hidden jewels in my mouth. oh yum oh yum. gimme some more! :) i only wish we could buy the junior size and not just kids...

These days, a visit to SF doesn't seem complete without a trip to Bi-Rite Creamery. It was a nice sunny day in the Mission district, so there was quite a line, which I guess isn't unusual, even on not-so-nice days. It was actually good, because it gave me time to look at all their offerings of the day. Salted Caramel was #1 on my list, had to try that, but what to get for the 2nd scoop? There was toasted bananas, vegan chocolate, honey lavender (!), and a bunch of other stuff. I figured toasted bananas would be good w/the salted caramel so those were the flavors I got. Mm, excellent texture and flavor, not too sweet or icy. It was almost like a gelato consistency. My friend got the hot fudge brownie sundae, which was AMAZING, with the warm brownie and spiced pecans. Definitely warrants a repeat visit the next time I'm in town.

3.5 stars - Came here for the first time on a sunny San Francisco Saturday and battled parking for a good half hour and inevitably waited in a line which to my delight moved swiftly.  I ordered a single of half cookies 'n cream and half lavender honey. I've had lavender honey elsewhere and thought it was little too potent here. I thought the cookies 'n cream was the smoothest, yummiest ice cream I've had in a long time but still didn't think it was incredible (translate: this place's 4.5 star rating is overrated).

What does an almost 40 suburban mom have in common with 20-something tattooed scenesters?  A salted caramel single cone, baby!  But then this suburban mom stepped it up by buying a whole pint of salted caramel to go.  Sadly, the pint never made it home though, for the ride home to the suburbs was a long one.

I guess I just don't understand what all the hype is about.  After standing in line for 35 minutes and hearing the people behind us in line rave about it, I expected something uniquely delicious, but my Balsamic Strawberry tasted like strawberry and my Roasted Banana tasted like banana.  I kept trying to taste something unique, but I just didn't.  The ice cream was good, but so is Ben and Jerry's.

Right after trying Ike's place just not too far from here, my friend took me to here right after. I was so surprised that this place was ranked as one of the best places to get ice-cream; however, I was not disappointed. I got the cookie monster, which is basically a combination of cookies and cream plus their own custom ice-cream (I don't recall what it was called, but it was like a cinnamon graham cracker flavored) and it was absolutely delicious. I was so thankful that the worker had recommended it to me. To my surprise, this was all home made and not some factory ice-cream pumped by the pint. In addition, I could see them working in the back making the delicious looking ice-cream cakes. I absolutely recommend any one in the area to come here since I am actually not from this area.

Maybe it has to do with the fact that summer is here or maybe it has do with the fact that my palette has become more refined as I continue to experience San Francisco's unbeatable cuisine, but Bi-Rite creamery has grown on me. Last night, my friends from San Jose were visiting and we did the "18th/Guerrero" gourmet tour, including stops at Delfina pizza, Tartine, and finally Bi-Rite creamery. My friend (who is pretty much an ice cream connaisseur as she plans to open up a frozen custard shop) had some recommendations including the balsamic strawberry ice cream sandwich and the banana split made with caramelized torched bananas.  I first tried some samples, just to see what the options were looking like- the snickerdoodle cinnamon was quite good, as was the balsamic strawberry. However, as we had just feasted on Delfina's rich creamy cheese laden pizzas I decided to go for the lighter options being the plum sorbet. This was very tart, very plum, and very refreshing. My friends ordered the banana split, coffee toffee sundae, and balsamic strawberry ice cream sandwich. Oh wow. Awesome choices (of course I had to sample their delicacies as well). The banana split combination of bananas au flambe, roasted nuts, and roasted banana ice cream was divine, as was the coffee toffee ice cream sundae made with Ritual's coffee ice cream, and delicious toffee chunks (not to mention a generous drizzle of chocolate sauce and crushed almonds). The balsamic strawberry ice cream sandwich was fantastic as well- the cookies must be made with some kind of shortening that doesn't harden under low temperature as they stay moist and delicious. Although I couldn't really taste the balsamic flavor, the strawberry was light and creamy. So, it looks like we might have a tie between Bi-Rite and Mitchell's right now, although I still do think Bi-Rite should expand their sorbet and yogurt options.

I love the ice cream here. It's so good it should be illegal. The salted caramel that everyone raves about is as good as everyone promises. The snickerdoodle is good too. The Vanilla is hands down the best vanilla ice cream you have ever tasted. There is another reason to come here though. I don't know how Bi-Rite does it, but the people that work behind the counter are some of the best people I have ever come across working or not. They are happy, engaging and entertaining. I am personally in awe of one of the boys that works there. He makes me smile and doesn't even try that hard. He's just an awesome human being and kinda cute too! :)

Bi-Rite Creamery is a famous ice cream spot located in the Mission District. They hand make their ice cream, soft serve, and baked goods in small batches. And you can really taste the difference! The ice creams are extremely soft and creamy without any annoying ice particles. My favorite flavors are the honey lavender and toasted coconut. Unfortunately, their famous salted caramel is not for me since I don't like the resulting bitterness after mixing sweet and salty together. But at least sample it when you're there! You might think it's the best thing ever! We'll often get the toffee chocolate chip cookie to go with our ice cream. Very good cookies, but not the best I've ever had. Also, I have never tried their soft serve at the window next door since their ice cream is just too good. This is a must-stop in SF regardless of the long lines. I would definitely try to stop here anytime I'm remotely close to the Mission. All in all, this particular block of 18th St simply has too much deliciousness going on (Tartine Bakery and Pizzeria Delfina)!

Excellent ice cream, although there is a limited selection of flavors.  I've enjoyed their coffee sundae (made with Ritual coffee ice cream - see my review for Ritual), berry sundae, and peachy sundae.  All the ingredients that they use are extremely fresh.  Bi-Rite Creamery is a must for ice cream aficionados who prefer quality over quantity.

Four words: Salted Caramel Ice Cream. It is simply divine. I have tried a lot of their different flavors, but the salted caramel is my favorite- it is sweet & savory....words cannot describe its' lovliness. I'm lactose intolerant, but this ice cream is oh so worth it. They also offer interesting sundae options....like salted caramel with sea salt & olive oil. It is always nice to try something different, but the ice cream by itself is satisfying enough.

If you know me, there are few things that come between me and ice cream (even a stomach virus doesn't stop me).  The first time I set foot into Bi-Rite was during the Red Bull Soapbox Derby, and the line totally threw me off, but we all know this means that it's delicious.  Just getting a whiff of this place takes you away.  If we're in the area, I'll stop by for a treat, even if we're on our way to dinner.  I'll have dessert before dinner.  Heck, I'll have dessert for dinner.  As others have mentioned, the salted caramel is to die for.  So is the lavender, but I'm a sucker for anything lavender.  The staff is super friendly and helpful, the portions are generous, and the ice cream is blends of both creamy and sweet, which is what makes good flavor.  You know they use quality ingredients when you don't just taste syrupy sugar.  Bi-Rite is my ice cream heaven.

Meh. I support the organic thing, but aside from that I didn't find it to be all that different from Mitchell's (other than the nicer decor which then gets passed on to you in the form of high-priced ice cream). The ice creams were alright for the first few bites but then became too sweet. Like many other posters, I too tried the lavendar honey and salted caramel, and I also checked out the coffee toffee. All "nice" but nothing "knock your socks off." On the upside, the staff was super nice, they had good music playing, the portions are substantial (great for sharing), and it is kinda cool to have the creamery right by Dolores Park.

The ice cream I had was good.  Mint chip and Mexican chocolate with almond topping.  Yum!  Line was long, but moved incredibly fast.  My companion was a little disappointed when we got to the front, as they were out of a lot of flavors.  It would have helped to cross them out on the flavor list out front so that you knew what was available before getting up to the front of the line.  Overall, good but not great.

i'll let you in on a secret.  i wasn't big on bi-rite when i first tried it.  i'm talking about the salted caramel here.  i didn't like the salted caramel (insert gasp here).  i just didn't get the hype.  every time i revealed that to someone, they would look at me like i had just admitted to killing a dog.  with my bare hands.  seriously, they would be beyond offended.  i don't know what it was though, maybe those were my rebellious, defiant, go-against-the-grain years. so i spent some time in bi-rite exile (it was called nyc), where i still had a fair share of good ice cream.  but now i'm back and i decided to give bi-rite another try.  i don't know what happened between then and now (maybe nyc helped me develop functional taste buds), but to those of you who i may have offended before with my negative declaration of the salted caramel, i'm truly sorry.  truly truly sorry.  i can't explain my callous opinion in the past, but i get it now.  to prove i really mean it, i'll eat as many scoops of salted caramel as you want.  no, really, i will.

I don't get what the rave is about . I came here a few days ago to try to the ice cream . I tried the honey lavender which I didn't like . I had a scoop of the vegan strawberry sorbet and a scoop of chocolate on a cone . They both tasted pretty average .. nothing special . I've never had vegan ice cream so I was surprised to find that it was not bad .. tastes just like real ice cream ! The cone was good .. not stale , but just right . The ice cream here is not bad , but I've had better .

Having left the left coast, I feel the occasional frustration with myself for not exploring San Francisco more in my four years in the East Bay.  Last weekend, that occasional frustration turned to unbridled self-loathing when Renee T. took me to Bi-Rite.  How could I have deprived myself of this heavenly treat for all those years? Having sampled a few flavors between us, I urge the reader to try the brown sugar with the caramel-ginger swirl.  Crushed up gingersnaps just plain belong in ice cream (See also: Toscanini's Black Bottom ice cream, Cambridge, MA).  Alongside the brown sugar, I tried the ricanelas, a bright cinnamon flavor, that paired really nicely with the ginger.  The honey lavender was refreshing, though I wouldn't describe the lavender as subtle.  I've had fantastic honey lavender before (Christina's, also Cambridge, MA), but the Bi-Rite version was leagues more floral and fragrant, which I liked, but I imagine might be off-putting if you're more of a traditionalist when it comes to ice cream flavors.

The flavors are so unique and delectable that it went beyond my expectations.  If at any time I am in the Mission area, I will definitely make my way back to Bi-Rite Creamery.

Believe the hype.  I'm an ice cream expert and this place made me feel small and unknowing. Visiting S.F. and my ex-girlfriend/foodie, she always tries to blow my mind with her newly found favorite epicurean discoveries.  This time, again, she achieved her goal. We arrived at Bi-Rite to find only three people in line which apparently is very rare as normally the line is out the door and down the sidewalk.  Listen, if there's a line, just like Salumi in Seattle, GET IN LINE and enjoy the wait, you will be rewarded. I had the hot fudge brownie Sunday which was very good but I would suggest just going for scoops of like three different flavors so you can really appreciate the craftsmanship of this stuff.  I ended up taking tester spoons out of Laura's cup!   The Honey Lavender was amazing in a weird "I'm eating flowers" sort of way.  Try it for sure. The staff was cool, with the transplanted Milwaukee dude breaking my chops about my Cubs hat.  The guys working there laughed and joked with every person who came to the counter, taking the time to do so and yet no one minded waiting!  So good to be back in a place with friendly, jovial people! Cheers guys!  See you again before I leave.

Ice cream was definitely good, no doubt about that.  But is it worth the price?  I think not.  I would prefer to go to Naia's for better gelato and cheaper prices.  Even a good pint of Haagen Dazs vanilla could beat this.  Or even the father-in-laws home made ice cream out of a wood and iron churn.  Actually, that's giving the wrong impression.  The father-in-laws ice cream puts this to shame.

Giving this place anything less than 5 stars is a crime against the beautiful Straus Family cows of Marshall, CA who made this ice cream possible. In fact, the Salted Caramel really deserves at least five and a half stars, since I crave it daily. Soy Chocolate, Coffee Toffee, Chai Spiced Milk Chocolate. All perfect for mere mortals. Ice Cream Sandwiches, Popsicles. Love 'em both. But Salted Caramel on an organic sugar cone... ooh... it gives me cool, fleur de sel dreams.

Oh and don't forget the homemade ice cream sandwiches. Argh...drooling gotta go get a Bi-Rite fix pronto!

Wow. 4.5 stars??? Wow. wow man. Before I came here I was expecting some ice cream sent from heaven i.e. perfect i.e. giving me a permanent smile for the day. The place is cute on the little street corner. Don't expect some basic ice cream flavors, you're getting some salty caramel, honey lavender, etc.. The cookies and cream I had was like NO OTHER. I think it was the cookie in it. YUM. Still giving me flash backs of its deliciousness. The butter pecan is also heaven sent!!! TRUST ME.  Not only are there unique flavors to please your palette, it's just the right amount of creaminess and sweetness to clam your sweet tooth.

very very good ice cream. super creamy and smooth. salted caramel, oh how i loved you... we will meet again, soon. :D my only thing is... i'm not for long lines and their line can get a little ridiculous. however, it does go by quickly so my recommendation is to go with some company, and you'll be out of line in no time. also, parking can be bad but that's a given in the area.

Great cupcakes, at least the variety I could purchase (3 flavors) from the outside window. Disappointed that we could not enter the bakery to see if they had other desserts available like the cakes etc. shown on the website. The line to get into the bakery was long & there was no place park. Not sure I would go through the trouble of traveling that far for a limited variety of items to purchase, long lines & no parking

Like pretty much eveyone else in San Francisco, I'd walk a mile barefoot over broken glass for Bi-Rite's salted caramel ice cream.  OK, maybe not, but I'm mildly lactose intolerent, and am more than happy to put up with a grumpy tummy if I can eat this ice cream.

Bi-Rite's salted caramel ice cream is the best ice cream I have ever had. The other flavors I've tried are great too, just not easily and obviously #1. Other outstanding flavors: roasted banana, something with a cinnamon base that my brother got and I ended up eating half of (but then again, he ate my salted caramel; so we're even), honey lavendar. I know the place sometimes gets some flack for a hipper-than-thou staff, but in my experiences, they were always fine (including the time one of my friends ended up breaking parts of the shop as it is a small space and she was very excited/jumping around at the prospect of yummy ice cream after a long day).

Insulin rising, temperature decreasing. I love you, Salted Caramel. You are so lusciously creamy you even have a disclaimer about your texture; a feat no other ice cream can live up to. You are surrounded by well meaning flavors, but I must ask why your Cookies and Cream companion had an unpleasing lingering mint taste? Shh, don't speak, Salted Caramel. You are best inhaled in one swoop and I can't wait for your response. Keep me guessing and I will come back for more.

This joint could get 5 stars from me simply because they use metal tasting spoons. However, there is so much more to love about Bi-Rite Creamery.  Since I love numbered lists so  much ("I'm a good driver, a very good driver"), here goes: 1.  SALTED CARAMEL ice cream.  One billion stars. 2.  Lavender-honey ice cream.  I no longer have to drive to Fairfax for this flavor! 3.  Prime location.  Who doesn't want to lick an ice cream cone in the park? 4.  Cute shop. 5.  Nice staff. 6.  Makes you feel rich.  Why?  Because a pint of ice cream is eight bucks.  That is basically the equivalent of buying a Bentley instead of a Honda.  Since I don't have any plans, or means, to buy myself a $100,000 car instead of a $6,000 twenty year old vehicle, this $8 pint makes me feel like one of the founders of Google.  Look at me- I'm so outrageous in my purchasing habits!  Throwing caution to the wind!  An $8 pint of pint of ice cream!  Why not? I'm worth it!

Thank you, thank you, thank you, Jee, for bringing us to this place.  I wish I lived in SF so I could stop by every week to see what new flavors they're cooking up.  I got to try the Honey Lavender (weird, I know, but totally delicious, in a Green Tea ice cream kind of way) and the Salted Caramel (OMG delish - I kept thinking how this would pair with any of their chocolate creatings).  I definitely plan to make the stop when I'm next in SF.  Damn!

Bi-Rite opened the soft serve window shortly after I moved away from the hood. The salted caramel soft serve on Wednesdays is perfection. Forget the swirl... give me salted caramel only! The $3.50 price tag is steep but let's see if they'll serve it at Bi-Rite's 'coming soon' Divis location which is close to my new place.

My love for bi-rite goes out to the salted caramel ice cream!! the best I've ever had! other places make it too salty. The flavors of the salt and caramel are just perfect, I can eat 2 scoops and it won't be too overwhelming. There's always a line but it goes by pretty quickly.

I finally got to see what the hype was all about and checked Bi-Rite out this weekend.  I can't say the ice cream is the best, but they had some interesting flavors.  I wanted so hard to love this place, but the ice creams were just okay.  I'm all for different flavors, but these didn't work too well for me.  The location was my favorite part - it was in a fun chill area of SF up the street from Dolores Park, so I'd come here on any sunny day.

There are 10 trillion reviews here. I don't care. They have intriguing flavors, use my favorite milk from a farm powered by cow pies. They want you to compost your used cups and little wooden spoon sticks - just like the ones you would eat dixie cups with as a kid. Oh, and possibly most important, they are spitting distance to Delores Park, so you can sit in the Sun and eat your ice cream as the Blue Angels fly overhead. At least during Indian Summer and Fleet Week. the last one is true.

Mission ice cream crawl stop 3 of 4. The ginger, salted caramel, and lemon samples I tried were all Mel Gibson-crazy. Settled on the salted caramel and paired it with the more conventional roasted banana. The ice cream here laughs off the usual creaminess-flavour trade-off like no one besides Sketch in Berkeley. It's not quite as creamy as Mitchell's, but it has a better mouthfeel. The banana has a deep, deep taste, and the salted caramel, as you may recall, is Bai Ling-insane. This is shock flavouring, which is why I'm withholding the fifth star for the moment -- don't know if it'll stand up to repeat visits. But repeat visits are guaranteed.

I know I can't add anything to all the rest, but... OMG. every single flavor deserves its own intricately written yelp ode.

Not worth the drive we did to find this place. Place is REALLY SMALL so if you are claustrophobic, not for you.

mmm.... rich....creamy...rich...creamy...so good. This is the kind of ice cream where the ingrediants are things like "MILK" so nice and natural (not like high fructose corn syrup, maltodextros-something). My fav was the peanut butter cup and the toffee flavors, though the honey lavender is definitely going to be my warm weather favorite. I had to share my hot fudge it was so so rich. I *NEVER* share my hot fudge.

5 stars for the best ice cream in the bay area. (and I live 2 blocks away from Mitchell's Ice Cream). It has EXCEEDED my expectation TWICE. On my first visit, I had their honey lavender. I thought I was eating perfume or a flower when I took my first bite. The flavor was refreshing, unique and SUPER YUMMY. I went back 2 days later because everybody was talking about Salted Caramel and I had to try it! However, they were out that night, so I pick the Malted Vanilla. It sounds plain... but that's the best ice cream I have ever had! I have yet to try Salted Caramel but it will happen soon. I like Toffee Coffee too, but Malted Vanilla is my current favorite.

I usually freak out in lines. I cant handle it. Buffets, Airplanes,DMV. I  just refuse to participate, it like brings back  memories of some former life as a housewife standing in line for bread in Russia or something.  This  ice cream is an exception.I don't care about the wait around the corner and down the block.  I don't care that its 40degrees outside and I'm typically under-dressed for a San Francisco summer and  the wind off Dolores park is blowing and chapping away at places it doesn't have any  business blowing and chapping.  I don't care that haven't eaten dinner, or i just had a  giant sugary something 10 minutes before.

Delicious, but expensive. They use organic milk and cream from Strauss Creamery, but still this is not a place you go for good value. I think the pints are like $8 each (to go). They are famous for Honey Lavender and Salted Caramel flavors but other flavors are good too -- especially one with a cinnamon cookie in it.

"Yum yum yummy, in my tummy.." - a song that my tummy sings on a rarely warm sunny day in the city when I'm eating something delicious. And Bi-Rite Creamery is delicious. I finally had a taste of the Salted Caramel ice cream that my co-worker raved about. He had every right to rave! It tastes a little like toffee. The saltiness is not overpowering. I also tried the Balsamic Strawberry, and the Honey Lavender. I had to knock off a star because of the Honey Lavender flavor because it reminded me too much of my bath soaps and lotions. My husband said it tastes like my lavender linen spray. Not exactly the most ideal flavor combination. But I'm sure the other flavors are worth a try, so I'm hoping to make a repeat trip into the city to see what else they offer. Just a mental note to myself: avoid anything that sounds like a scent from Bath and Body Works. ;)

This is the best ice cream i have ever had!!  It is creamy but doesn't leave that slim on the roof of your mouth like H. Slocomb does.  I always drag my group there whenever we are near! My favorite flavors are salted carmel, ricanelas, coffee toffee and pumpkin!  My friends also like the toasted banana and Banana Split! For the banana split they carmelize the banana's with a chef's torch!  I've converted someone who didn't like sweets or ice cream into an ice cream lover!  If you see the line wrapping around the corner don't fret, because the line moves quick and its well worth the wait!

TIP: find out what flavors your like and order pints to go so you won't have to stand in the line that snakes around the corner like your in line for the hottest club in town.  Come on a weekday to avoid long lines.. sample all the flavors including caradmon, salted caramel, cookies and cream, snickerdoodle, coffee toffee crunch among the favorites of mines.. MUST get the Salted Caramel.. and eat it fast because its so creamy, it'll literally melt on the way out of the store! so buttery and sweet yet just a tad of salty aftertaste.  heavenly goodness that i dream of all day.

tried two things from here so far - sam's sundae and the twist softserve that they offer on saturdays (balsamic strawberry and vanilla flavors). both these items were amazing. the chocolate ice cream didn't have the powdery or bitterness that chocolate ice creams tend to have (i'm not a big fan of chocolate ice cream) and surprisingly, the bergamot olive oil made it even better! i wasn't sure whether i was going to like it because i don't really like adding olive oil to stuff, but wowwwwww. i now love bergamot and chocolate together! (recchiuti has a bergamot ganache, also delicious). vanilla soft serve - very good! it didn't have that artificial vanilla extract feeling, enough vanilla to make it super flavorful but not overpowering. super creamy, wonderful texture. balsamic strawberry soft serve omgggggg. i was skeptical because i DO NOT like balsmic vinegar. but this was....ridiculously good. i am now a balsamic strawberry convert and a soft serve convert. you can taste the flavors of soft serves so much more than with regular ice cream gonna try to come here on different days of the week so i can try all the flavors of their soft serve (and then several more days to try all their ice cream...hah)

I had the salted caramel ice cream in a junior/kid size cup. I love when salty and sweet are combined.... I don't think, however, this was that great. I think it was more salty than it was sweet. It was also pretty expensive. Again, I'm comparing to Ici at Berkeley. Ici is way better.
