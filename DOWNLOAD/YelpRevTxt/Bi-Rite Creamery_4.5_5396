I had the salted caramel ice cream in a junior/kid size cup. I love when salty and sweet are combined.... I don't think, however, this was that great. I think it was more salty than it was sweet. It was also pretty expensive. Again, I'm comparing to Ici at Berkeley. Ici is way better.

One scoop of Salted Caramel, one scoop of Balsamic Strawberry w/ Graham Cracker crust crumble topping, burnt caramel sauce and whip cream. Get in the line no matter how long the line is or how cold it is outside, you deffinately won't regret it. Amen

a stroll around dolores park after work + sunny and warm day in sf + great friends + tasty ice cream = perfect way to end a day in sf a friend recommended it after seeing a long line during the weekend. after waiting for 1 minute, i ordered the Salted Caramel with Individually covered Chocolate rice crispies topping with a bag of macaroons and MMMMMMMMM! My friend got roasted banana and another got cookies and cream. it was fantastic. Yummy! Most likely to return. NOT sure if it will replace that part of my heart that belongs to Mitchell's, but I don't know.. the variety of flavors and creaminess might just do it!

Bi-Rite Cremery is what Tina Turner might say if she tried this ice cream it's "Simply the best."   I, of course, tried many flavours and I couldn't get enough.  I finally decided upon the Salted Caramel--yes, I said Salt Caramel!  For those that are salt phobic I am sorry.  This is an experience that there is no substitute. The flavour profile was convincing and perfected.  Not too salty...it is just right.  I like caramel as much as I do chocolate.  I have had burnt caramel but haven't found that in a while.  Bi-Rite has splendid flavours - creme fraiche (a clean and rich experience), strawberry balsamic (delightful--more balsamic, please), honey lavender, and roasted banana.  These are great flavours and I think these are the most convincing, thoughtful and successful.  I have had at other vendors flavours like rose petal, cardamom (which some of you might know as one of my favourite spices), and Langka  (which is more commonly known as Jackfruit) but I walked away with no more passion as when I walked into these ice cream houses. I savour and pine to go back for flavour profiles I have never seen before.  You will get a scoop and wish you ordered two.  I avoid 18th street as much as I can-- if i am slightly near Bi-Rite Creamery I am going to pack on some weight.  Amazing, simply amazing. Recap of tasting (on a 5 star scale): Roasted Banana - 4 stars Strawberry Balsamic - 3 stars Creme Fraiche - 5 stars Salted Caramel - 10 stars Honey Lavendar - 3 stars

I used to think that Mitchell's had the best ice cream in the city, but after trying the chocolate and salted caramel flavors at Bi-Rite Creamery, I was forced to reexamine this firmly held belief. In general, the ice cream at Bi-Rite is perfectly flavored, smooth, sweet, and free of ice crystals (*ahem*). As for flavor, well, the salted caramel is a delicious must-try, and the chocolate is possibly the best plain chocolate ice cream I've ever had, and is surprisingly - and happily - similar in flavor to the chocolate gelato at Gelato Milano in Berkeley. But the piece de resistance is the Sam's Sundae, a spectacular concoction including the aforementioned chocolate ice cream combined with  bergamot olive oil, coarse sea salt, and whipped cream.

What really got me wanting to come sooner than later is because of one flavor - the honey lavender.  When I read they have this flavor on one of the reviews - that was it.  All the other reasons why others came were just secondary.  I LOVE lavender - everything lavender.  The first time I had lavender ice cream was at Palomino over 10 years ago and that special fragrant and taste stayed with me. This place is small.  To the left are shelves of goodies you can take home from the tasty crispy cones, cookies to the flavored chocolate sauce.  There's a small freezer next to the counter where you can find pre-packed pints and quarts of ice cream, ice cream pie, ice cream cake, ice cream sandwiches, cookie dough...etc. When it is your turn - the folks behind the counter were just friendly and patient.  You can ask for taste after taste and they happily give you a spoonful of whatever you requested on a REAL spoon.  Yes folks, they use real spoons and not tiny plastic taste spoons like other places.  This is very impressive and really a fantastic idea, not to mention very environmental.   I had to try the honey lavender first, after all we are there because of it.  One small taste and I was in love.  Ok - pint of that.  Next was the salted caramel I read so much about - taste of that, fell in love for the 2nd time - yup, a pint of that too.  Tasted the balsalmic strawberry, wasn't our cup of tea.  Next was the mexican chocolate with salty peanuts, it was tasty and we decided to get it on a cone.  At the last minute, I decided to add the toasted banana flavor (single can have up to 2 flavors, double up to 3 flavors...) even though we haven't tasted it - it was good.  While paying, I noticed the fresh cookies and added a chocolate chip cookie.  The cookie was thin but it was chewy and full of chocolate chips!  It was the perfect companion to the ice cream cone - we sat inside to enjoy our treats while checking out the menu and other flavors...thinking what we should be getting on our next trip over. Thanks Yelpers for another great place, we wouldn't have known about this place if it wasn't for Yelp and it's Yelpers.

I've finally experienced the wonders of Bi-Rite Creamery. I wasn't feeling too adventurous so I settled on a cinnamon flavour with Snickerdoodles in it. It tasted just like the cookie but with ice cream. The staff are really nice. The guy at the counter was really concerned that I might drop my cone. I appreciated the effort. Luckily, when we went, the line wasn't terribly long but then again, it is getting a little colder in the city.  I'm definitely going back to try more flavours. Hehe.

There is a good reason why bi-rite has 1800+ reviews and almost 5 stars. Im certain those reviews cover the ice cream which is indeed exceptional. I went on an evening that was COLD to avoid the queue (and that I did). The girl that served me (Mercedes) was super nice and greeted her customers with warm welcoming smiles...it goes a long ways in my book. Mercedes service + bi-rite product = winning combination.

Definitely the BEST ice cream I have ever had. I just tried their seasonal Pumpkin flavor yesterday with another scoop of Ricanelas.....MMMMMMM. It's incomprehensible how perfect their ice cream is....just creamy enough to fill you right to the comfortable satisfied brim, but not enough to make you sick like Coldstone's. The service is great--no qualms about letting you try as many flavors as you want before you make your decision! The line is absolutely 100% worth it.

I was worried that the hype wouldn't match the ice cream, but I'm glad that it met my expectations.  Don't be scared to see the long line of people around the block---if you don't have any place to be, stand in line and order the salted caramel ice cream, it will absolutely make your day.  They also have vegan chocolate coconut ice cream that is delicious as well.  This is a great stop on your way to Dolores Park.

Ice Cream! yummy! I tried the Salted Caramel, Toasted Coconut, Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl, and the Ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles). I had to say that my favorite out of those was the toasted coconut. It seriously rocked my taste buds! The ice cream was creamy and the flavors always came through very nicely. I think the mixes were done very well and I am definitely a fan. Parking can be a pain, it took us 45 minutes to find a spot but that could be because we are just unlucky. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a different twist to  the usual ice cream flavors. It's worth the time and effort!

There always seems to be a decent line outside Bi-Rites! Seating is minimal inside and although there are some benches right outside, the cold SF wind doesn't always make eating ice cream outdoors very easy! I came back for the salted caramel ice cream. They're more than willing to let you try all the flavors they offer. You won't be dissapointed and the line is always worth the wait!

Some people are pretty opinionated about their ice cream.  I don't find myself that opinionated, but I definitely prefer Mitchell's over Bi-Rite.  I happen to get some Bi-Rite myself every time I happen to find myself in/near Dolores Park with my girl (and huge Bi-Rite fanatic) Anne Marie B., but I wouldn't come here by myself.  I guess I just don't "get" it here!

It was a cold and rainy afternoon. Still, there were 5 people in line ahead of me. Bi-Rite is a destination ice cream joint. I had the malted vanilla with peanut brittle, and the salted caramel. Both very good with a luscious creamy texture. I will go back every time I am in SF for sure!

There's a line for this place but I like how it is organized by the black rope thing. The line moved pretty fast and I was able to try a few samples when I got up there, although I felt rushed with everyone around me. I got the snicker doodle and the salted caramel and it was good! It's interesting because it's really different from Mitchell's since all of Bi-Rite's flavors are unique. It is a must try! I want more!

Do I need to bother with a review when everyone else has raved about this place?  YES!  It's for me.  Thank you to the management for opening such a special no-frills shop.  Since having their salted caramel (and ginger) ice cream, nothing from other places even tempts me.  The smooth, tasty, intense flavor lingers in my memory like no other (of course in a good way).  Just wished we live closer so I could try all the flavors.  My daughter had the brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl & coffee toffee.  Equally delicious!  It helps also that they have seats inside (though not many), so if you are there on a cool day, you can still enjoy your ice cream without freezing.

Perfect dessert for the Memorial Day weekend.  I ordered their Brown Butter Pecan and it was super satisfying on a warm afternoon day.  Creamy, home made, tantalizing.  However, it wasn't the best ice cream I've ever tasted.  I'm partial to gelatto.  And... their line was out the door.  The space is small and squishy but the customer service was accommodating since they served you in groups.

The ice cream is delicious and creamy. I had balsamic strawberry and chocolate on a cone. It was yummy. The only negative about this is that it was a really long wait and it was quite chilly outside.

So my husband and I were in the city one afternoon and he mentions that we should try this ice cream place he heard about. Ice cream? I'm in! So were driving around the area where we think its located until I spot some happy looking people licking ice cream cones crossing the street. From there we followed the steady stream of folks with ice cream until they lead us like a trail of ants to Bi-rite creamery. Outside the creamery was a long line of people (like 10+) and parking was no where to be found. We circled a several block radius searching for a tiny spot for our tiny car but we could find nothing! Nothing I tell you! We started arguing - "Why didnt you take that spot? Didnt you see that spot!!!?" "That wasnt a spot, that was a driveway!" "No, it was a spot, and now its gone! Ugh!" Our desire for ice cream was driving us mad. So after 20 minutes scouring the neighborhood for a spot, my husband decided to drive by the creamery one more time and if we didnt get a spot, we were giving up. And then, it happened. An ice cream miracle. We drove by, and the 10 minute loading zone right IN FRONT of the shop was open!!! Yes, RIGHT IN FRONT!! This never happens to us. Tears of joy streamed down our faces and we quickly apologized to each other for getting snippy earlier. We got out of the car, proudly and smugly for finding such a precious gem of a parking spot and the people waiting in line looked envious (undoubtedly they were parked miles away). So now to the ice cream. Its wonderful. The toasted coconut was delectable. The chocolate ice cream was the best chocolate ice cream I've ever had. SO GOOD. I do have to say though ordering was a bit soup nazi-ish. No time to decide what you want - and you can barely see the menu until you are right there at the counter. And then you have to move over and get in the other line to pay or else someone behind the counter will yell and say "Move to the other line to pay!". So yeah we didn't know the whole "routine" but now we do and will be prepared.

After dinner at Delfina's my friend I and came to Bi-Rite. My best friend saw the shop on the Food Network and she asked me about the creamery and I told her that I know exactly where it is and I have been there many times. When we were trying to find parking for dinner the line was still long after dinner the line was slighty shorter but it was still long! It was worth the wait though! I LOVE Ricanelas!! I finally got to try the Salted Caramel and it was good!! I think I have found my flavors! Although the cofffee toffee is good and I love Blue Bottle!

Let's be honest - no one's reading this review. There's a sea of us writting reviews for bi-rite. Currently it's a 1 in a 2369 chance my review will be the one your eyes decide to scroll over. So, for my own sake I'm writting a review, but also for my own sake I'll keep it short and sweet. Came here for the Carmel (salted that is) but left in love. First off we got here about 20 min before closing the line was still down the block. Yikes we might not make it! But, alas, we did :) There were 5 of us so we all got to taste quite a few combo's of goodness. Me - Salted Carmel + Roasted Banana - personally I think I choose wisest as it both were wonderfully sweet - but not too sweet. and the fruity creamyness of the banana complimented the carmel quite nicely. Hubs - Ricanelas - so freakin' amazingly good I can't remember what other flavor he got. This I thinks should be on the Big Eats list instead of the carmel Friend 1 - a double dose of salted carmel. Not that the flavor isn't good- but - heloo - boooooooring! Get another flavor! But he was happy with it. Brother - Banana-kiwi sorbet! Sour, sweet and creamy at the same time. Delicious! Momma - Honey Lavender - A flavor just like my mom, relaxed, sweet and welcoming. The lavender is such a unique thing to taste rather than smell. They did it well. Dad - weirdo - Lemon + chocolate something. Not a good combo andhe admitted it wasn't good. Each individual really good, but together in a cup - kinda weird - not the perfect pair. We loved it and will be back as often as we possibly can.

Regardless of how cold it may be or wet outside if you are near Bi-Rite Creamery you must visit this place. We were freezing and may of looked silly walking around with a bowl of ice cream but it's so worth the shivers! Salted Caramel and the Lavender Earl Grey and the Ginger.. Yes, I mixed all three together and enjoyed each one immensely. Dare I even say it's close to even being as good as sex? OK, that may be a way off comparison but it's simply the best and most amazing thing!

Perhaps it's a coincidence that both ice cream spots that I luh-luh-luv have the word "rite" in the title--Bi-Rite? Rite-Aid? Not to compare them on the same level, but both do ice cream rite (right). Yes, I'm THAT girl who is more inclined to order orange-cardamom and honey-lavender and earl-grey flavors on a cone. But I can get down with their snickerdoodle, too! I just think there's something for everyone here. Just make sure to enjoy it across the street while sitting on the Dolores Park lawn with some good company. You'll love it so much that if it falls off your cone and lands on the same grass that Lord knows what else has been, you'll make sure to dust it right off and try again. Best ice cream I've had in a long time.

Holy moly, why has it taken me so long to try this place?  The gf said she wanted to try Bi-Rite for a while and since we were in the city we thought we swing by.  However before hand we already had ice cream in Vacaville, Sushi in Japantown, Foie gras at the Chez Spencer on the go Food Truck, and so I thought she wanted to pass but she remembered.  We drove by and she said she will call me to tell me of the flavors (I had already said I wanted Earl Grey) but there may be additional flavors.  While I was circling around I never got the call.  I came back around and she was ready to go with two pints of ice cream.  Where was the call?  What's going on?  I thought I had a say in what ice cream I get to buy (next time she'll circle around).  She said she had tried both flavors and they were too good so she just picked those two.  What are the flavors?  Honey Lavender and Earl Grey.  We ate some when we got home and daaaammmmn, it was good.  Really puts the ice cream I had earlier in the day to shame.  The honey lavender has a great fragrant smell of pure lavender.  The earl grey ice cream is just perfect as the flavor isn't too over bearing or strong.  The only thing I didn't like was it's $7.99 for a pint but you know what, since the ice cream is so good, I'm willing to overlook this price point.  I guess you don't have to ask whether I'll come back or not. On another note, I added a crushed salted caramel macaron with the ice cream, let's just say that is my new dessert of choice!  I better go play some basketball or else I'm going to get fat.

I tend to like my ice cream filled with shit....no, not FECES, but yummy ice cream shit. My ideal flavor would be something like chocolatechunkscookiedoughfudgeglobsmarshamallowsn­utsandanythingelseyoucanthrowintheicecreammaker. Bi Rite is a bit more minimalist, but totally yummy when I'm in the mood for something sweet and simple, yet delectable. I swooned over the salted caramel, which contains nary a trace of good ice cream shit and is simply a lovely flavor explosion in my mouth.

I'm a hardcore Mitchell's fan, but my friend kept talking about this place, blah blah salted carmel, blah blah honey lavender. So I went. I walked in, in kindof a daze. There was no line when I went, and the staff wasn't too helpful. I looked around, confused as all hell, then just went with pre-packed salted carmel and honey lavender. Honestly on service I'd rate these guys lower but...... This ice cream is SOOOOOOOO creamy. even right out of the freezer!!! The salted carmel wasn't totally my thing, but the honey lavender was! totally right up my alley and the best thing I put in my mouth that week. I def. want to go back and try other flavors!

ended my birthday with some sweet lovin from Bi-Rite Creamery. went home with $40 worth of frozen goodness: coffee toffee, balsamic strawberry, mint chip, roasted banana. 5 stars as usual for Bi-Rite. 100 stars to the bf for knowing how to make me scream (for ice cream). oh behave!

We're major ice cream fanatics and this place may have the best ice cream we've ever tried. It is incredibly delicious -- creamy, intensely flavorful and never any touch of freezer burn. They have traditional and more outlandish flavors -- they are all absolutely delicious. The line can be very long and since we couldn't wait, we went around the line and went straight into cooler to pick up some to-go pints and an ice cream sandwich. You can't go wrong with any of the flavors. A must place to visit in San Francisco.

When I went to Bi-Rite Creamery for my first time, I noticed that there was a super long line at night around closing time.. It seems to me that people like me were crazy enough to wait in a long line to get ice cream on a saturday night when they can be doing something else. I thought, "hmm this place must be special".... I can tell you that the staffs are super friendly and nice... If you are unsure of what flavors to get, they let you sample as many flavors as you need and are nice about it... Some of their ice cream flavors are a little too extreme. Their ice creams have strong taste and it brings party in your taste buds... This place is def. a place to visit when your around the area. I can't get over how their neighbors can deal with the crowd and all the noises at night...

On a cloudy, cold summer night in the Mission District of San Francisco, a line wrapped around a corner block like a snake, though it moved like a snail. When I approached the tail, I knew its head had to creeping into Bi-Rite; I had heard the raves about Bi-Rite Creamery, and had long searched it out prior to my short visit to the City.  The wind swept through the streets, but no one paid it heed. I was constantly moving back and forth to warm up my limbs because it is 95 degrees in Alabama in the summer; but not here. These people love their ice cream, even in 55 degree summer evenings. I had debated on going to the infamous Humphry Slocombe instead, but after seeing the line and the dedicated following that Bi-Rite led, I knew I had made the right choice.  Finally, after 45 minutes, I enter the shop. It is a cardboard box only much more decorated. The place was tiny. Thus, the long line. Knowing I would not be able to return again any time soon and after braving the interminable line, I had to opt for the largest bowl, which allowed three to four scoops. I knew that the Salted Caramel was voted their best ice cream, if not best in the city, so I knew I had to try it. For my other three scoops I chose Roasted Banana, Malted Vanilla with peanut brittle, and Brown Butter Pecan.  The Salted Caramel was astounding. I was blown away. It was rich, creamy, sweet, salty, smokey, savory. It hit all the taste buds. The smoke came from them using a dry caramel base, which means they literally burn the caramel. They use high quality sea salt, and it shows. The salty taste over balances the sweetness, which is rare to taste in modern ice creams; most are too sweet.  The Roasted Banana was little more than banana ice cream. I tasted very little caramelization or roasted flavor. But as a banana ice cream it was extra creamy and sweet.  The Malted Vanilla was a great base to add peanut brittle to. Instead of a boring sweet cream base, it had a hint of malt flavor which was a perfect, subtle canvas for the sweet and salty peanut brittle. There was not nearly enough brittle in the ice cream. A crunch factor in ice cream is paramount, and I only had two brittle pieces.  The Brown Butter Pecan was an amped up, fancier version of butter pecan. They just burnt the butter, which gave it a smokey, caramelized taste. The pecans melted in my mouth right along with the ice cream.  I wasn't even mad about the line; I was impressed. But the thing that bothered me was their generosity. I know it is a big city, and they have to serve as many people as they can, but the sizes of the scoops would have barely feed dwarves. It wasn't even funny; a bad joke. The generosity of a business speaks louder than the product at times, and though it did not take away from their awesome flavors, it did leave me in want. I have been to shops in NYC that gave scoops twice the size of the ones here, and for the same price.  That aside, Bi-Rite does ice cream right. Some of the best in the country without a doubt.

The favorite ice cream here is salted caramel.  It's very good.. So good in fact that NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAND IN LINE for a small 4 oz portion.. Just go to directly to the counter, grab the small portion out of the freezer (to your right) and pay for it.  Presto, you're OUTTA THERE in less than 2 minutes!  Thank you Bi-Rite!

i'm a kind of person that likes to try different things. so once i ate ice cream here (only once) i just can't bring myself to buy anything at baskin robbins anymore. i'd definitely come here again if i was in the area. when my co-worker told me about this place, i was like what? salted caramel? that's just odd. but i went and got a scoop of that and a scoop of chocolate soy. i was in ice cream heaven. who would have thought that something like "salted caramel" could be so frickin' yummy? mmm...salted caramel....

best ice cream IN THE CITY  seriously, this place is like the Italian gelato in America and everything else is just, meh.  The ice cream here is fresh, uplifting, and light.  It's chock full of flavor and will refresh you after a long work day or a hot afternoon.    True, the choices are limited but that just means that the few flavors they offer are exceptional and top quality.  It's a specialized niche and Bi Rite does it superbly well.  I still love Mitchell's, Polly Ann's, Swensen's, etc, but you will seriously think and remember that this place is different. Special even. It's that good.

Their ice cream is good, but it is not stand-in-a-line-for-20-minutes-while-you-could-be-­chilling-at-Dolores-Park good.  As far as ice cream in the city goes, Bi-Rite's flavors just don't stand up to Mitchell's or Humphry Slocombe's.  But it does have a great location.  And sure, if there is no line and I'm in the neighborhood with a hankering for a scoop, I'll pop in.  But what is the deal with all the hype??

If you don't have an hour to wait in the long line, just go straight to the freezer and grab a prepacked pint. I saw on Yelp that they were known for their salted caramel, so I just grabbed a few and paid for it. OMG, so good!  Their Strawberry basil is pretty good too. I don't think you can go wrong with any favors there.When I get off my stupid diet, I'm going straight to Bi-Rite for a few cartons!

It was a gorgeous sunny afternoon in San Francisco.  I go play tennis at Dolores Park for about an hour.  It got a little warm so I head over to Bi-Rite.  I ask the nice man behind the counter if they have any flavors that are sugar free, as I am watching my sugar intake nowadays, but he said no.  And the sugar amount in sorbet is actually higher than the regular ice creams, I had no idea.  Whatever, I wanted some ice cream.  I end up getting ginger and earl grey.  Both flavors were really good, but the ginger definitely overpowered the light taste of earl grey.  ALSO, there was no line at 2pm on a Thursday, yes!

Be prepared to wait in line as there is a line any time of day. Went around 8:30pm on a Saturday night and waited about 30 minutes, but not bad if you have good company. The soft serve side had virtually no line, but I had to stick with the original ice cream. Had the Salted Caramel and Balsamic Strawberry flavors - both were delicious. Salted Caramel may be becoming one of my top favorite ice cream flavors. Next time I want to try the Brown Sugar and Ricanelas!

Oh my God..two words. Salted caramel. Absolutely heavenly. I'd heard so much about it so I figured since it's my first time I better start with what they're famous for. Wow! No words can describe its creamy, rich, sweet, salty deliciousness. You just have to go try it for yourself. I went on a Friday night around 10:30 after having dinner w/friends and felt like a little sum'pn sum'pn sweet for my ride home. I just double parked in the bus zone across the street and ran in (it was packed of course). Luckily I didn't get a ticket but it almost would've been worth it!

After hearing such great reviews about this place, I checked it out about a few weeks back. I ordered the lavender honey and toasted coconut as a single scoop. The toasted coconut was yummy, but the lavender honey was gross. It tasted like some Chinese herbal ointment. GROSS! I also felt as if I was eating lavender aromatherapy oil. Next time, I'm going to stick with something "ordinary".

Get ready to cream your pants ...  eww! Get your heads out of the gutter. This place is so stellar you might drop your cup causing you to spill your ice cream all over your pants and exposed feet. I went with a visiting friend from Texas. He's a bottomless pit and claims he knows the best places for all food groups. Seriously, he claimed Cold Stone Creamery holds top reign (what a fool). So we were sitting in Dolores Park and watching a drunkard harass a group of stoners in front of us. And then, I began to crave ice cream (it could have been the man's bourbon bottle). So I pulled him over to Bi-Rite across the corner. The line extended all the way to the corner of Dolores and 18th. I cannot stand lines but I vaguely remembered a coworker mentioning this place as the best spot for local homemade ice cream. I skeptically stood with my arms crossed and sneered at the crying baby to my right. My pessimistic self reached the counter and chose the Toasted Coconut as my friend ordered Malted Vanilla. Boring right? Far from anything simple. The flavors of churned cream coated my mouth as my sweet spot sang for joy. The bits of coconut were chewy and nutty (I needed a moment). Now just saying, if you are going to do it, cream your pants over this. Not yanking your chain...or anything else for that matter.

The ice cream was fantastic - I had the cherry almond and the ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodle bits). Delicious! The ricanelas was great - cinnamon-y like horchata, not cinnamon-y like a Red Hot - and the snickerdoodle bits got all moist and awesome. The cherry almond was my favorite though. Delicate almond flavor and big chunks of cherry and sliced almonds. The line was pretty long since it was unexpectedly warm today, but it moved very quickly. There are some benches outside and the Creamery is just across the street from Dolores Park. Next time I'll try an ice cream sandwich!

Creamy goodness!

The ice cream here is high quality stuff, no doubt about that. It was terribly rich -- I have mixed feelings about this. I don't know if I want my ice cream to be so sweet. It wasn't very complex, but maybe I need different flavors. Good stuff nonetheless. A bit pricey too.

Ice cream always makes you happy. I ordered the toffee coffee and ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles). The ice cream was thick and creamy, absolutely delicious. The ricanelas had a great cinnamon flavor, with some chewy cookie bits. The toffee coffee had wonderful coffee flavor with delicious, crunchy bits of toffee running throughout. Even a single serving is quite generous, and even better since you can pick two flavors!

It doesn't get better than Bi-Rite.  THE flavor is Salted Caramel.  I agree with my wife that it is too strong by itself, it needs to be paired with a fruit friend.  I haven't tried the Balsamic Strawberry and the Almond Cherry wasn't served when we went the second time, but I suspect it will be good.

okay, so i'm kind of bias when everyone says "this is the best ______ ever!"... cause when people do that i have high expectations. and when i have high expectations, i usually get disappointed. therefore, instead of having high expectations, i go into a new food place thinking "watch, i'm not even going to like it" and then try to find every fault i can to not make me like it. this isn't the case with Bi-Rite. i seriously LOVED the ice cream here the first time i tried it. now i know why people wait in long lines to get this ice cream. i loved the selection of flavors. the honey lavender actually tastes like honey and lavender. i like the the rituals coffee toffee and salted caramel. this place brings the hefferness of me out... holla!

I'm kind of over the whole "just because its weird, its better" thing. Don't get me wrong Bi-Rite is good, creative, and independent ,and I like all those things. The staff is super efficient and friendly and they have cute baking stuff up front. The Balsamic strawberry kills it, and the Salted Caramel is pretty ridiculously awesome, but for me its kinda like new wave California pizza. Yeah, its different and tastes good and all, but somethings just wrong. The consistency is almost always off, and unless there's toffee in it I don't want my ice cream to seem brittle. I think when it comes to ice cream this place is definitely worth a go or two but I'm sticking with Swensen's and Mitchell's. Their ice cream does what  its supposed to do, cool you off on a hot day, give you a big ass grin and make you feel like a kid. Sorry, Bi Rite but your fancy flavors and holier than thou patrons never have. 3 and a half.

Yummy is the word!  I haven't spent a lot of time in the Mission since moving to the Western part of town, but I am "rediscovering" my old stomping grounds and finding some wonderful "new" additions, Bi-Rite being one of them.  The salted caramel was delish, but I think my favorites were the toasted coconut (megayummy) and the coffee toffee. I tried the soft serve, but I think the regular ice cream is better.  Being an old married type I am  woefully behind the times, but I am excited to see this growing trend of creative and new food in the Mission (and else where) and plan to explore more..

This place has the best banana split on the planet.  I couldn't believe it when they took a torch to my bananas, but oh man, that creme brulee type crust on them afterwards was to die for.  I imagine it's worth while to mention their ice-cream is great too.

3 years ago, my friend brought me here on our tour of her neighborhood. She was trying to woo me to move to SF from Boston. "They have lavender ice cream? Who said that was allowed?" It was definitely my favorite, but since my early days in the fog, they have developed "Sam's Sundae" a chocolate scoop with bergamot olive oil and fancy salt. It's the best thing ever.

An eco-friendly, local, sustainable, recyclable wet dream. In my own backyard. They pick the lavender for the honey lavender ice cream off some hill like, in DP or something. I don't really know but I do know it is delish and environmentally savvy. My roommate gets the caramelized bananas? What? Yes! And they are so good. My personal fav is the salted caramel. I'm not cool enough to like something that everyone else doesn't like. Actually, there is nothing NOT to like about this place. Well... other than the line on a hot sunny day but even then, grin and bear it. its totally worth the wait. The staff is super friendly. Get a frequent flier card. I promise, you'll need it.

This place vies with the Bombay Creamery for my second favorite ice cream shop.  Only Ici is better.  When my friend told me we had to go to Bi-Rite for ice cream, I was sketched out at first.  The only Bi-Rite I'd ever heard of was a club discount chain store more seedy than a strip mall Rite-Aid.  One look at the flavors and I was a convert.  My favorite is ricanelas, a snickerdoodle and cinnamon ice cream.  I'm a big fan of chewy chunks of stuff in ice cream.  Bi-Rite has a good balance of brightly flavored, sophisticated ice cream and ice cream with candy or cookies in it.  The price is reasonable, way less than Ici for ice cream that is almost as good.  I like that I can get two flavors in a single scoop.  The only disappointment: they don't have good cones.

Amazing ice cream. Like the kind of ice cream you want to ship to your friends who aren't fortunate enough to live in San Francisco (seriously, I looked into it).  During the unexpected streak of beautiful weather we've had the past two weeks, we decided to lunch in Dolores Park - along with every other person with MLK day off.  Since it was close, we decided to check out Bi-Rite. After waiting in a line that reached the end of the block (seriously, in January?), it was our turn. Four words: Roasted Banana + Salted Caramel. Bliss.

In response to Tiffany's Review and her thoughts on Plastic Spoons, maybe because they are trying to do the right thing for the environment.  Perhaps you haven't watched the news lately or read the newspaper, but there is something going on called "global warming" and plastic is a major contributor.  So, Bi-Rite, I praise you and Tiffany, you should be ashamed of yourself.

I came here with a girl friend on one of the week nights. Parking was crazy!!! After circling around for nearly 20 minutes, I found a parking a block away. =)  When I got there, the line was LONG and it was COLD outside. I had the dark chocolate cookie mint chocolate chip ice cream sandwich. It was DELICIOUS! Definitely worth the wait in the cold! I also tried the vanilla lavender flavor that the lady working there recommended and it was good. There are benches outside for people to hang out. I would definitely come back on a nice warm night to sit out and have an ice cream sandwich again.

long lines and more expensive than your average corner ice cream shop. but the build-up is worth it. bi-rite is right next to dolores park so enjoy your ice cream on the lawn. birite's flavors are unusual. but theyre SO good. you can try samples of any of the flavors but my favorites are: -balsamic strawberry -brown butter pecan -earl grey tea -ricanela's and one that was beer-flavored ..some of the flavors change but others are pretty standard.

I came to San Francisco for a conference and had a free day Saturday the 15th. Knowing this already I knew one of the must-go places to stop by was Bi-Rite Creamery, after seeing Sam's Sundae on Food Network's The Best Thing I Ever Ate with Aida Mollencamp (funny thing it should be "The Best Thing I've Ever Eaten). So a couple of friends and I took a taxi here (well worth the fare in my opinion) and we arrived about an hour before it opened. During the taxi ride though I did notice a line outside some place on the corner of Guerrero and I'm not sure what other street. It turned out to be Tartine Bakery, another place I wanted to go to, and basically I got baked goods from there....but AFTER waiting in line and buying the bakery's goods...Bi-Rite Creamery was open. Here it is ironically short, sweet, and to the point. GET SAM's SUNDAE! Amazing chocolate ice cream, orange-ish olive oil, sea salt, and whipped cream make for a WOW ice cream sundae...you don't even need any of that caramel or chocolate fudge etc etc. After eating such an amazing sundae, I decided to get 5 flavors of other ice creams...Salted Caramel, Roasted Banana, Brown Sugar Ginger Swirl, Earl Grey, and Brown Sugar something.... All good, especially the earl grey in my opinion, but I still kept thinking about that Sam's Sundae... Just go and get one! I miss it already :|

we came here on a Monday night but the place was still packed.  the line-up was huge and almost reached the corner.  but judging by the velvet rope, there's always a wait for the most popular ice cream shop in san francisco. the store itself was dainty and cute with not much room for anything else but the ice cream counter, cash register, and a few seats.  (most customers lingered around the outdoor benches to enjoy their dessert.) we tried the following flavors: -toasted coconut -balsamic strawberry -chocolate -honey lavender -brown sugar they accidentally gave us the chocolate flavor when we asked for coconut but were nice enough to give us the coconut scoop on the house. i'm personally a huge fan of flowery flavors so i must recommend the honey lavender.  the brown sugar flavor was really rich and sweet-- recommended for sweet tooths.  the coconut had a nice flavor and pieces of coconut in it, not too strong.  the strawberry was nice and the oil was an interesting touch, definitely pulling away from being too sweet-- it created a unique pallet of flavors.  lastly, the chocolate was extremely rich and creamy in texture, more so than most ice cream shops

Their ice cream shop and flavors are definitely one of a kind. I tried several 2 samples before I settled with the salted caramel and the mint chip. It's good, but got tired of it after a small cup. 3 stars because the girl helping/giving us samples was annoyed and she wasn't afraid to show it. Her attitude made my friends and I not want to be there so that wasn't too pleasant. Besides, that's part of her job.. She shouldn't work if she has that kind of attitude dealing with customers or first time customers in our case.   So my overall experience was just okay. It's probably not the best out there and isn't worth waiting in line for. I'd probably just go to Mitchell's to save all the hassle and they have always had great customer service!

460 reviews and going strong. Instead of another "oh so delicious" review, let me tell tell you why I was tempted to try Bi-Rite. Of course it includes the fact that Bi-Rite consistently ranks on Yelp's most popular and most reviewed lists, but also because I'm one of those suckers that just needs to see what the hype is all about and simply cannot feel left out. I must consistently be in-the-know and around the up-and-coming hotspots. So when the weather gods granted us San Franciscans a rare warm sunny day, I took the opportunity to try the wildly popular salted caramel and I was not disappointed. Bi-Rite offers flavors aside from the usual vanilla and chocolate, so you must give it a try so you can say, "been there, done that".

It's good, real good.  But the excitement for me is all about the flavors; the ice cream itself isn't heads above some of the other great ice cream you can find in the area.  I've tried the salted caramel, the lemon, the honey lavender, and most recently and deliciously, the roasted banana and the orange cardamom.  How fun is that?

sorry mitchell's, i'm a bi-rite girl.  what a perfect location across from Dolores park!  every time i'm at the park now, even if i'm not hungry (or just about to eat dinner), i have to get me some bi-rite. even though the line is always long, it moves quickly enough, and their flavors are posted outside, so people don't have to cram inside or wait until they're at the counter to decide what they want.  I usually change my mind about ten times while I'm in line, and always end up getting more flavors than just one, which clearly is a sign that bi-rite has too much goodness on the menu.   The richness of the ice cream, yet dense smoothness reminds me slightly more of gelato, which is probably why it seems like such quality to me.  Plus their flavors are perfectly suited to my palate.  I'm particularly fond of the brown sugar with carmelized ginger swirl.  And while some people may find just a taste of the honey lavender to be good, I'll enjoy a whole scoop's worth because it's not an intense overpowering of lavender, (but it's certainly not your traditional chocolate or vanilla). I haven't met a flavor that doesn't taste like what it says it will, only it tastes like a fresh version of the ingredients rather than an over-sugared mass produced made-for-ice-cream taste.  I'm smitten with bi-rite, I just wished I lived close enough to be able to buy the pre-packed quarts and get them home before they melt (or are completely eaten!)

We stopped in after a delightful sunny afternoon at Dolores Park, and although the line was long it was ABSOLUTELY 150% worth the wait! The flavors are rich and delicious, and the scoops are small so definitely get two! Ask the scoopers their favorite flavor- they won't disappoint, plus they will let you try as many as you like!

Mitchell's and Polly Ann's are really my favorite SF ice-cream joints, but Bi-Rite has now entered the picture big time! You really can't avoid one-of-a-kind flavors like Salted Caramel, Chai Spiced Milk Chocolate, and Roasted Banana! They also offer tasty ice cream sandwiches (get the Mint Chip), popsicles, cakes, cookies, and pies. With gourmet desserts, expect gourmet prices folks- and I thought their double scoops were not so double. Regardless, it's all "rite" going to Bi-Rite and I'll be back for more.

never really disappointed as long as i stick to what my palate likes best, but if i were to be adventurous, bi-rite seems to be a great place to try it out since you can taste little samples! on the "hot" days, there usually is a long line in front, so if you are spending a lazy afternoon in the mission grab an ice cream, go to tartine for a bite to eat, and lay out in delores park and people watch, dog watch,  play frisbee, etc. its a nice neighborhood full of cafes. i really liked the lavender ice cream. creamy, fragrant and vanilla-y they give you a pretty healthy serving for 'one scoop'. i would sum it up as "the gelato eater's ice cream". they have a great selection of sundae's and you can build your own sundaes. you really can't go wrong here.

Bi-Rite Creamery gets it right...EVERYTIME!! This is the first stop i try to make once i make it out to SF. For ice cream i will wait, and for Bi-Rite i will wait a long time! Especially since the line sometimes wraps around the corner and down the street. There aren't many ice cream shops that are worth waiting 20 minutes for, but this is definitely the spot. It's the kind of ice cream that makes you feel like you're doing good for the world if that makes sense. They have unique flavors, some odd, some obviously delicious...i swear they could have a liver flavor and make it taste good! I usually go for the coffee toffee, salted caramel, and then test out one of their more unique flavors like strawberry balsamic and honey lavender...ALL GOOD! The ice cream has a reallly good consistency and texture which takes the cake from any other ice cream ive had, and you can get more than one flavor in each cup. Right across from Bi-Rite is Dolores Park which makes it an ideal location to sit and enjoy the Cali sun...the test is trying not to finish your ice cream before you even get across the street to enjoy the weather. Trust me, its hard. Their cookies aren't so bad either! I got the chocolate chip toffee ones that were nice and chewy. Next door, Bi-Rite has a soft serve window where you can get soft serve ice cream cones and ice cream sandwiches, and they also have a grocery store further down the street where you can buy their packaged ice cream to take home.

I'm not a big ice cream buff. My friend dragged me here for some overly priced ice cream after we had some overly priced pizza. I had the $6 banana split. It was pretty good but so is any banana split worth $6. I did, however, sample the salted caramel and I have to say, I bought a $12 pint of it. I ate the whole thing. I never eat a pint of ice cream. Needless to say, I will buy another pint of it. And if it came in a half gallon size, I would buy that even though I'd probably be out $50. Beats smoking.

God, I love this place.  That frickin salted caramel ice cream is like crack!  I walk by and think "no, i don't need ice cream.  i'm full.  i don't need to feel piggy today." But no.  I walk in.  And I come out with salted caramel ice cream.  Is there a 12 step program for this?  There really should be.  Crack.  Salted caramel crack cream.

Was really impressed with the Olive Oil ice cream - rich and creamy with no weird after taste.  As for the salted caramel, it wasn't as great as everyone hyped it.  I guess when you already make your own ice cream at home, a place like this just becomes another ice cream place.  Not so special.

Yum yum!  I came in to try the salted caramel (which was good - not amazing, but solid), but was overcome by the Cookies n Creme!  Plus, when I came in a second time, I forgot my punch card, and even though I only bought one cone, he punched me three times!  Even that much closer to some free yummy ice cream - what could be better?

This ice cream is tasty!  Tasted the salted caramel (delicious!) but still had to go with Brown Butter Pecan and Cookies 'n Cream.  By the way, gotta love the fact that "single scoop" really means two mini scoops and two different flavors.  The Brown Butter Pecan was a tad grainy, which surprised me a little, but the Cookies 'n Cream was perfect.  A nice treat on the nicest day of 2008 yet!

I'm really a patisserie girl. I will choose cake and cookies over ice-cream any day until I was introduce to Bi-Rite Creamery. I had the roasted banana and double ginger. My friends had the honey lavender and salted caramel. It was all sooo delicious. There is a huge difference in homemade ice-cream versus Dryers. The quality of ingredients is very noticeable. Costco croissant versus Payard - If you are going to indulge in the calories, make it worth it. The only drawback is the parking situation and the long lines. As with fashion, my motto is a girl's gotta do what girl's gotta do.

this place is so overrated.  How nice would it be to be able to sit down and enjoy your pricy ice cream without people stepping all over you.   I get that its next to the park and its just a little stop in spot, but san franciscans are like foodie mobs... The ice cream is good, but for the amount of peoole that frequent the place, they should put in outside seating, or expand into somewhere... for the amount they charge they can afford to. Same thing with the grocery store.

I love ice cream. I especially am a sucker for specialty, not- your- run -of the- mill- buy- in -the -freezer- section ice cream. I like all flavors, I'm a chocolate AND vanilla person. Having said this, I don't eat ice cream that often. Maybe once a month? Once every two months? So it isn't like I have a ice cream problem and certainly not anything resembling an addiction. HOWEVER. I happened to walk by Bi-Rite one fine Saturday afternoon (maybe one of the best days of my life, by the way) and stopped dead in my tracks. I told the gf, to go on and buy some beer for our afternoon at the park. Now, I had heard the hype, I have friends that are true ice cream addicts and they mention Bi-Rite like fundies mention Jesus. It was time to check it out. I waited in the enormously long line, but it didn't really bother me, that is the kind of bad ass day I was having. What to choose?/ That was probably the hardest part of my day. So many amazing looking choices, brown sugar pecan, balsamic strawberry, malted vanilla, the list goes on. And then there are the sundaes! It was a tough decision indeed. I ended up going for a simple two scoop in a cup. Balsamic strawberry and a rich caramel. Married and having their honeymoon in a cup for me to enjoy. Though the line was long, and the customers demanding, the Bi-Rite staff were nice and full of good humor. This was impressive, because having worked in an ice cream shop way back when, I know how grueling scooping ice cream for hours on end can be. You actually start to develop little bruises up and down your arm. So I paid, stepped out into the sunny Mission and had my first bite of heaven. I met my lady on the hill and kept smiling til that cup was empty.

There was a line, but it went really fast.  The staff is pretty friendly, and it's in a cool neighborhood with other good places to eat.  They must put something in their ice cream because it's really money.  It's so money and you don't even know it.  I tried the Salted Caramel and Butter Pecan, and they were both insane.  Whenever I come back to SF, I know I'll be visiting Bi-Rite for sure.

There's just something about Bi-Rite ice cream...so worth the calories and the wait!  An update on flavors - earl grey is still my favorite, but it's a seasonal flavor (why???) and only available in the winter months (Jan-Mar) per the staff.  So...in the interim, my new favorite is their brown sugar laced with ginger/caramel...yum!  And, I finally sampled the honey lavender...I was afraid it would be very perfume-y/soap-y tasting, but I think I kind of liked it...had a spice reminiscent of earl grey...

Some pretty creative flavors, forcing me to go overboard and try the burnt caramel, honey lavender and cookies 'n cream all at one go. Although I hate jumping on bandwagons they definitely surpass other places in creativity. The ice cream is extremely rich so one scoop should be enough. Going all out and ordering three different flavors may actually muddle your experience a bit. If I lived in the neighborhood I would definitely be coming here on a regular basis to try each and every one of their interesting flavors.

always a line, even in 50 degree drizzle. The secret is to go next door to their soft serve, they never have a line. The soft serve has more limited flavors but usually have their unreal salted carmel soft serve. Crack disguised as ice cream, you will have to buy a pint for yourself and your friends.

Oh Bi-Rite, I wish I could have you every day for dessert if not for the long line in the cold SF weather. Anyways, I've tried coffee toffee, earl grey, honey lavender, and another daily selection that I forgot the name of. I keep hearing/reading that the salted caramel is amazing, maybe I'll try that one day, although I do really like my go-to combo of coffee toffee and earl grey. The earl grey has said to have kept many people up till late at night, not so much for me but it's just as delicious.

"date" nights are always awesome!!! also, extra extra stars to the employee who let us go in one night for our ice cream when we walked up just as they were closing their doors. danny and i let out a collective "awwww man!" as we walked up and the worker was kind enough to let us in to get our delicious bi-rite on! ps i never notice the hipsters at bi-rite, always seems to be families when i'm there. but i don't give a shit about them anyways cuz they're just out of towners who moved to the city and think they're all that cuz they live in san fuck-cisco. who cares!?!?

I didn't want to like this place, as the last thing I need right now is an expensive habit.  But I find myself thinking about the honey lavender ice cream all the time.  The honey and lavender flavors are so subtle, yet their combination is sublime.  Their sundaes are also amazing, and they're generous with the toppings (homemade whipped cream, marcona almonds, fudge, etc.).  The staff is nice too.  The guy at the counter didn't wince when I ordered the unlikely pairing of honey lavender *and* cookies & cream.

You have got to be kidding me.  This place sucked.  With over 2K reviews and 4.5 stars average, i was expecting at least decent ice cream.  The flavors were somewhat interesting, which is why I am giving 2 stars instead of 1.  However, the operative word for this ice cream place is Ice rather than cream.  Both the malted vanilla and the earl grey that I had and the coffee and the mint chip that my friend had were both very icy,  For the calories that I am consuming with ice cream, I would expect something more creamy and rich.  I have had better with grocery store bought ice cream.  Save yourself the money and the trouble and get a pint of Ben and Jerry's.  You will enjoy it more.

Where else can you go and get Lavendar ice cream! I was simply a visitor to San Fran when I tried Bi-Rite for the first time, but I became an instant fan. Things are simple but complex at the same time which sent my tastebuds into a frenzy. Being from LA where frozen yogurt is all the rage, it was nice to see a line of people who shared my preference for actual ice cream. So far the snickerdoodle is my favorite! Every time I go to SF, I make it a point to stop in and sample a new frozen delight, I encourage you to do the same.

This should be 4.5 stars. Great Ice cream, almost always a 20 minute wait though. This place has some of the best flavors ice cream imaginable. What I really like is that it all tastes light but flavorful unlike most ice cream places where it tastes super heavy. Like mentioned earlier there is almost always a line, weekends and weeknights. It moves quickly though. I like to try multiple flavors per visit but don't need 3 huge scoops of it. They offer small scoops in cup or cone. This way you can try 2-3 flavors for the same size as 1 regular sized flavor. My favorites: -Roasted Banana (So good and I am not even a huge fan of bananas) -Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle (Mmmmm) Dislikes: Note, these are still good, just not spectacular in my opinion. -Mint Chip (Very disappointing) -Salted Caramel (Eh, had a lot of hype but I wasn't impressed) This place is worth a try. Exotic flavors you can't get at most places. -

LOVE. I'm super excited about this new soft serve stuff. I have no doubt it will rock. This place has never failed to meet my ice cream cravings. Where else can you get balsamic strawberry and creme fraiche together? (FYI, I personally think it tastes like strawberry pocky.) My ultimate fav? BROWN SUGAR WITH GINGER CARAMEL SWIRL. I think it puts salted caramel to shame. But that's just me. Try toasted coconut too, can't go wrong.

Picture it: San Francisco, Sept 2010 and it's a heat wave. A mid 30's gay boy from the desert, who happens to be sweating like a you know what in church goes to the City for for Folsom and the GayVN Awards. One day while sashaying around the city, he decides to pop in line at Bi-Rite to see if the tasty frozen treats here give you the Big O as so many yelpers have claimed. While waiting in line he checks out the crowd, sizes them up and goes over the menu items wondering what two items to choose, or risk having his girlish figure expand...again. Once inside, I...I mean the mid 30's gay boy decide on two flavors - cookies & cream and brown sugar, to which he thought, "damn they stole my stage name!" Oh.My.Goodness!!! It was like a flavor explosion that I didn't want to end! It was smooth, creamy and tasty, nothing like you'd buy at the grocery store, baskin robbins or dairy queen. You'd think here in the Arizona desert there'd be something this good, but sadly I now know that I must travel to San Francisco for ice cream that good! It's okay, it's another reason to visit this incredible city. Oh, and that mid 30's gay boy wanted to take his ice cream across the street to Dolores Park, enjoy it and take in the fun. Sadly, the ice cream was so delicious, the cup was empty before they reached the crosswalk. I don't toss this around much, but Bi-Rite, J'adore you!!

Website gives you all the info you need on ordering, then you call in and order.  Very simple, pick an ice cream, pick a base, pick a frosting.  Pricing is reasonable - ~$33 for a cake that fed 8 people (with leftovers).  Pickup was easy (although I double parked, and have now accrued bad parking karma that will probably take a lifetime to expiate)...I even had a nice little chat with the guy at the front counter about how awesome his job is (he GIVES PEOPLE ICE CREAM for a living!?!  does it get any better?).   My only, qualified, suggestion for improvement would be that the people on the other end of the line give you some suggestions for ordering ice cream cake.  Mine ended up being kind of a vanilla overload (yes, it is possible) and I sorta wish someone had pointed that out to me.  Then again, I didn't ask, and I'm sure some people love vanilla so much they want to inject it straight into their veins.  When you work in ice cream, you learn these kinds of things, I suppose....I think what would be nice is if the website had some suggested combinations.  That would make a standout truly superlative.  Still love ya, Bi-Rite.

Ok, I admit to being ridiculously obsessed with the opening of this creamery.  I mean, after all, we have Mitchell's.  Does it get better? YES!  The salted caramel ice cream is so perfect, I could just keep on eating forever.  I'm going back for Sam's Sundae one day soon because it looks delicious.  As if this street needed yet another reason to visit it.  Oy. Edited to add:  I've now purchased four pints of the salted caramel ice cream.  The first three were *to die for*.  The fourth was so salty it was almost inedible.  You want it to have just a hint of salt, not taste like salty cream.  The sweetness has to balance it or ick.  So when I went back for my fifth pint, I told them about the last batch (my husband and friend, who have also loved this ice cream, agreed with me btw) being just way too salty, etc., and told them I'd like to sample the pint I was going to buy before I bought it because I really didn't want another pint from that batch again.  They acted like I was putting them out and honestly?  If I owned a business and someone had been there five times in the three weeks I'd been open, I think I would comp them the pint.  Maybe I expect too much.  Anyway, the pint was fine again but the experience soured me a little. Also, the Sam's Sundae is freaking amazing.  Amazing.

Bi-rite ice-cream truly makes the world a better place! With flavors like honey-lavender, orange-cardamon, and salted caramel - you will experience a moment of pure goodness. Makes me feel like singing Annie tunes! Ok, perhaps I'm getting carried away, but it's not just me. You should have seen the line on Sunday - it wrapped around block! So, if the sunshine isn't enough to perk your mood - run to the bi-rite creamery and sample every flavor, like I do. P.S. The staff is wonderful!

long line sometimes for ice cream, but its really worth it for the unique tast of combinations of ingredients that they use. My favorite flavor of ice cream from here is called "Honey Lavender" It so refreshing on a Hot day or even cold day (weather doesn't matter to me when it comes to ice cream), I have a lot of friends that love the "Salty Caramel" Flavor.

I don't get what the big deal is. Their ice cream is overly sweet and tastes exactly like Cold stone creamery, too creamy. I had four different flavors, the ginger, white chocolate with a raspberry swirl, salted caramel, and malted vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate pieces. All were cloyingly sweet except for the ginger ice cream. It was the perfect amount of ginger and wasn't too creamy and heavy.

In my neverending search for the Best Ice Cream I finally made it to Bi-rite Creamery today. Was it worth driving around for 20 mins looking for a parking spot on a Sunday - yes. Was it worth the walk 5 blocks on the windiest day so far this year - yes. Was it worth waiting in a line over 20 mins that stretched out the door and around the block  - yes. I tried 5 flavors. Toasted Coconut - not a big cocount fan so this one was just ok. Coffee Toffee - yummmm. Thin Mint - yummmm. White Choc Rasberry swirl - yummmm. Cookies and Cream - yummmm. I really was not expecting it to taste this good or to be worth it, but I have to honestly say that it was and I'd do it again. Although next time I'll have to try the Sam's Sundae. I made a stop at Bi-Rite market on the walk back to the car and grabbed a pint of Rocky Road with Almonds - yummmm and cookies and cream. I love Bi-Rite market too. Maybe I was just really hungry but the Turkey and Swiss sandwich that I got to hold me over before I got my ice cream was delich!!

De. Lish. There is definitely a wait and stanchions help keep it orderly. The menu gets passed through the line so you can decide on what you want when you get to the counter. There is a soft-serve window just down 18th with a much shorter line, which also serves ice cream sandwiches and other nibblies. Street parking can be very difficult to find so park somewhere and take the bus or walk.

So, I've been dying to go here, after hearing so many good reviews from my friends. I finally went, and...it is definitely worth the hype. First of all, there was a super long line that went around the outside corner of the store. But, the wait was worth it! There are sooo many flavors to choose from, and it was pretty overwhelming trying to decide what to get. The workers are really friendly and let you "sample" the flavors, until you decide what you want. I decided on the salted caramel (YUM x100), and the white chocolate raspberry swirl, on a cone. Pure delicious-ness. It wasn't TOO sweet, like other ice creams...it was just right. This is definitely my new favorite place to get ice cream :D

Bi-Rite Creamery is probably the best ice cream in the city. I had the honey lavender and basil my first time here and the combo was exceptionally good! The honey lavender was sweet but not too sweet and the basil had the distinct basil taste. My second visit I got the coffee toffee and balsamic strawberry which are two other great flavors. The coffee toffee was rich in taste with a crunch of toffee and the balsamic strawberry had the taste of fresh strawberries. I can't wait to try the other flavors!

Love it!! This was my second time visiting the shop. The first time, the line for ice cream was around the corner so we had their soft serve (which had no line, but limited selection). The soft serve was AMAZING. I would choose this option often. This time we arrived in the middle of the afternoon, and walked right up to the counter. The flavor selections are really creative, and they all sound amazing. I had a make your own sundae with one scoop salted caramel, one scoop malted vanilla, homemade hot fudge sauce, toasted almonds, and fresh whip cream. My mouth is watering as I type it out, it was DELICIOUS! Creamy, flavorful and fun! As an added bonus, this store strives to buy local. We don't live in the city, but now it's a must every time we visit!

even though bi-rite is super hyped, i'd say it definitely meets people's expectations! first time i came, i got the banana split, umm.. YUM!!! they cut the banana in half (hot dog style), sprinkle it with sugar, and then torch it! like a creme brulee. YUMYUMYUM. i want it right now :( i'd ask for light fudge though, because they have the tendency to drench it. i like getting a pint of earl grey on the side too hehe ;)

Typical groggy San Francisco weather, I assumed we can be in and out of Bi-Rite in a couple of minutes, well what do you know there still was a line! However, it wasn't my first time here, and let me tell you it is worth the wait. What's not to like about this place? Everyone loves ice cream, and on top of that made from SCRATCH ice cream so you know it's going to be the business. What I always recommend is the salted carmel and the honey lavender. These are usually the two flavors you wouldn't be able to get at your local grocers, but they also do have the regulars like cookies and cream, mint chip, etc... and those also taste exceptional. If you get the three scoop deal it totals out to be around 6.50-7 so it is a relatively cheap place to go after a heavy burrito when you're around the mission district.

I finally tried this place out. The ice cream is all organic, probably from happy cows, and very good! It's not very sweet, unlike ben and jerrys and baskin robbins. It's very creamy and perfect. I just don't live in SF so I wouldn't drive to the city just to eat ice cream there but if I was in the Mission, I would for sure go back and get a scoop of ice cream. You probably won't be happy with just one flavor choice but you can get 2 flavors in a single size scoop which was perfect! I had the strawberry balsamic and the banana flavors. The shop was small and the line went out the door. I liked that all their utensils (cups, spoons, napkins) you would use were all being recycled in a bin outside. They are very socially responsible and I loved the ice cream. Next time, gotta try the sandwiches.

Even though I'm often lactose intolerant, I really love ice cream, and I really love Bi-Rite!  I know everyone talks about the salted caramel, and it's a really GREAT flavor, but it's not my favorite.  I love the whole salty-sweet combination, but it's just bit much for me.  I can only eat about half a scoop without thinking that it's too rich for me.  I personally prefer the Ricanelas, which is cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodle pieces in it!  It's tastes light and not super sweet, and the cinnamon in the ice cream and the cookies just makes it awesome.  I also love the malted vanilla, cookies and cream, and mint chocolate chip (which DOES NOT have that fake, bright green color you get in most mint chocolate chip ice creams).  I've also heard great things about the sundaes, especially the one with the olive oil on it, and I'll probably try that sometime soon!  That, and the frozen yogurt next door too! Go to Bi-Rite... it's awesome!

Best ice cream ever. Everywhere else is now ruined for me. I have a slight addiction. I take everyone who visits me from out of town there and I stop in whenever I am in the neighborhood. I have never been there when there wasn't a long line but the staff keeps everything moving without making you feel rushed along. I went once an hour after they were supposed to close and they were still talking people and had a line around the block. I doubt they do that often, but I was in great appreciation.  I strongly recommend the Salted Caramel, Honey Lavender and the Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl.

MIght as well add to the hype! The first time I came here I thought it was a club - the line was wrapped around the block! Yes, the line is long, and yes, parking does suck, but really good things never come easy. I come here solely for the salted carmel ice cream. As noted, the single is 2 scoops - so a more subdued flavor like roasted banana or ginger is a good complement. The texture is smooth and very creamy and the salted caramel is especially rich and robust in flavor. Buying a pint is more cost efficient, but as other Yelpers have noted, it melts fast. Maybe bring an ice chest? There is limited and crammed indoor seating - so probably not a fun evening outing if it's super duper cold outside. But go anyway!!

When seeing a line out the door for a place. You know it's good! I had this place booked marked forever since I saw "Salted Carmel" I love Salted Carmel cupcakes so I thought I should love the ice cream. We knew this place was good cuz parking sucks around the area and there was a line out the door. Since I really wanted to try the place we circled around for parking and finally found one. Walked over and must say a cute neighborhood and waited in line. I was getting all excited to try ice cream and even at night and cold there are people here eating outside with there ice cream. They also have another window open but its for Soft Serve, I hear they change there flavors but that night they only had Chocolate and Vanilla which they didn't to much business. Everyone was in line for more of the other flavors they had. They had a good selection but I wanted to try the Salted Carmel and Honey Lavender. They also sell pints of all the ice cream on the menu. Of course we picked up a few pints. My date end up getting Salted Carmel and Roasted Banana. After trying the Salted Carmel it was a little bitter for me but I don't know if its cuz I ate the Honey Lavender first. Both was good but I notice the ice cream was not overly sweet and nor the cone which was great. The Banana was good too. I just they would be consistent with the size of the ice cream. Mine was huge and my date got small little balls of ice cream. Compare to mine his was small. I think when I do come back next time I want to have the Honey Lavender again and Roasted Banana. Yum!!

Can you say "me too"?  I gotta give it up for the Bi-Rite Creamery.  I was initially suspicious, but I found an ice cream flavor that I loved and I keep coming back for more.  Plus nice people work there (contrast to many in the actual Bi-Rite store) and they compost a lot of their crap.  And no matter how long the line is, it's not a frenzy like Mitchell's can be (though I do love Mitchell's...)

I had very high expectations for Bi-Rite, but it ended up being pretty disappointing.  I tried four flavors: salted caramel, honey lavender, brown sugar and ginger, and toasted coconut.  The brown sugar and ginger was the best by far and was very good.  The salted caramel was a bit too sweet.  I was most disappointed by the honey lavender; the lavender left an unpleasant soapy aftertaste.  The toasted coconut was pretty good.  All the ice creams were pretty rich.  I'd like to try some of the other flavors, but since I was disappointed with what seems like their most famous flavors, my expectations are much lower now.

Yesterday was that gorgeous random February day that happens every year when it's suddenly Spring... maybe even Summer... if only for a moment. It breaks my heart to know it won't last, and I was scared to celebrate it too much. But knowing Bi-Rite was so close to where we ended up having lunch was too tempting to resist. I have been on a real sweet and salty kick so I had to try that salted caramel ice cream! It was fantastic, it tasted so incredibly fresh. I always love lavender paired with another flavor, but I was a bit worried about the honey, I thought it might be too sweet, but it was perfect, I dare say I liked it better than the caramel! The hubs had coffee toffee and chai milk chocolate, they were fantastic as well, with little bits of toffee and chocolate to enjoy included in the ice cream. The next time I go I will have to try Sam's sundae, chocolate ice cream with olive oil and sea salt... sounds absolutely heavenly. Alas, today is a pleasant day but I can tell already our little taste of the sun is over. Thank goodness we enjoyed it with a little ice cream while we could.

definitely hits the spot during a dolores stomping, though the line is longggggggggggg and daunting. it's just sick how you're waiting and everyone before you comes out licking their mounds-- wait, i'm not done-- of cold creamy ice cream! parking is ri-DICK but if you're doing the city-ped thing (which you should be doing anyway as sf is all but 8 n some miles from end to end) it's no biggie. a big plus for a nostalgic feel that beckons my inner fat kid. my loyalty, though, still goes to joe's ice cream because of the hard-to-find flavors, a dedicated parking lot, cheaper prices, and teenage memories associated with checking out all the hot catholic high school chicks from ica when i was just a mere baby dyke in nike chris webbers!

You can always tell a good ice cream place by the vanilla. Bi-Rite has good vanilla. The line is long, but worth it for the delicious creamy vanilla. It's a bit pricier than what I'd normally pay for ice cream. Still, it's good and comparable to Mitchell's.

Skeptical at first but i tried their balsamic strawberry, it works together!  my friend got the balsamic strawberry with roasted banana ice cream.  I got the coffee toffee and salted caramel.  Needless to say, it was deliciousness in a cup!  Had mitchell's later that evening and it was traditionally boring...it could've been that i was stuffed from dinner.  i've always liked mitchell's but i am beginning to like Bi-Rite even more now.

Had to try the salted caramel and it was good. Extremely rich and a little heavy, but when mixed with the roasted banana it was like a banana's fosters on a cone. I also really like the portion sizes, not too big. Will definitely be back

Now - I'm no ice cream aficionado and the ice cream I had here was very nice, but just because there seems to always be a long line (at most weekends stretching around onto Dolores St) does not mean their product is superior. Correction, the ice cream, salted caramel and a choc chip combo (in a very dry sugar cone) was better than nice, I give Bi-Rite Creamery that. I'd even go far as saying it was quite delicious, however so has most of the ice cream I've had across the Mission, nr Filmore St even in Westfield Mall. My reasons for why the line is so long, is that 1) there is no competition in the immediate vicinity and it's by a park (a cheap mobile ice cream van would be equally busy in such a location) and 2) the serving space is the size of a shoe box. I've seen bigger trunks than the tiny little fridge the ice cream is served out of, coupled with the minuscule entrance doesn't make for a very efficient nor practical place to deal with such a high volume of people. It's impossible to see what's on offer until you get right up to the fridge and we all know that we like to sample a few flavours before deciding what to actually choose. No wonder the line is so big. If you have the luxury of going mid week outside peak hours, worth a try otherwise hop round the corner, pick out a magnum ice cream from the convenience store and quench that thirst for ice cream in a fraction of the time...just sayin'

fresh, local, and organic ice cream made to perfection! one of the best ive ever had! mmmm... so lickably delicious! after an hour of searching for parking i told the bf screw it... ill just pick up a cup for us and we'll just eat it in the car. just my luck, by the time i got their late friday night and there out of salted caramel ice cream! oh i was so bitterly dissapointed, especially coming from the east bay and having to pay a $4 dollar toll! i opted for a double scoop of chai spice milk chocolate and coffee tofee. damn, that was some good shit!! the chai spice milk chocolate is enough to keep me coming back! the ice cream was so incredibly creamy and i enjoyed surprise of little "crispies" inside. the chai spice milk chocolate had little bits of milk chocolate while the coffee tofee had bits of tofee. i also had a taste of the bf's cookies and cream. eh, didnt care much for it. after a few bites he asked me what flavor it was. not a good sign if you cant even make out what flavor it is. i tasted it and was dissapointed that the taste of milk over-powered the cookies and cream aspect of it. i retreated back to my scoops of goodness. cant wait to try the goat yogurt, roasted banana, and of course salted caramel. --- 5 stars: i am a loyal customer and cannot live without this place/restaurant! 4 stars: consistently great food. a place i would definitely frequent if i dont already. 3 stars: good food. id come back for more if a particular craving for something specific they offer hit me. 2 stars: for the sheer reason of convenience and semi mediocre food [but convenience being the majority of reason] id come back. 1 star: id never be caught dead in the place ever ever again.

AWESOME ice cream. I stumbled upon this place after eating a dinner one night at Pizzeria Delfina. I'd been to Bi-Rite grocery before, but had no idea this place even existed. Boy was I glad I happened to stumble in. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the Mission and got a sweet tooth.

Not sure what all the fuss is about.  On a warm Sunday afternoon people stand outside just for this ice cream.  I guess since it's a creamery - the ice cream has to be really creamy.  So creamy that you can't really taste any flavors.  I guess its a matter of preference.  If you like rich, really sweet ice cream - then Bi Rite is for you.  I tried the Honey Lavender and all I tasted was sugar. The best Lavender ice cream I ever had was from Sketch Ice Cream in Berkeley....

Not that this place needs another review, but when you try something this delicious you want to let the world know that they need to try it too! The salted caramel ice cream is the best dessert I have ever eaten - hands down. One of the few places where the line is completely justified (and it goes by fast). Everything you have heard is true.

I ate here for breakfast. Actually, our group was staying in line for Tartine and told me to walk just two blocks and try this place in person for the very first time. I believed it opened at 11 and I got there at 10:55. There were just a few people waiting before me so there was barely a wait. I opted for the salted caramel since everyone says it's the most awesome. And it was very goot at the rate of 2.25 each kids scoop.

All Bi-Rite virgins must pop their cherries as soon as they get the chance to. Missing out on such flavors like salted caramel, balsamic strawberry, roasted banana, snickerdoodle, and HONEY LAVENDER is truly a sin! Go stand in that long line and think about why you haven't tried it already!

I love sweets so I am not picky but I HATE LINES.  I came here with a group that was determined to get an after dinner dessert.  First of all, it was the parking....then the line wrapped around the street corner...I was secretly praying we could just leave, plus this was during a time I was dieting so I wasn't really planning on getting anything anyways.  However, the line went down pretty fast...and I eventually gave in and ordered a small salted caramel...omg....it was the BEST DARN ICE CREAM I have ever had.  Anyways, I am sure with all the reviews you get the idea..but point is..I would totally line up and wait anytime for this.  It was definitely worth it.  I am scared to try the other flavors because just the salted caramel has made me a fan and I sure don't want to be disappointed!

this is the place to go for homemade and unique ice cream-though the selection is pretty limited.  salted caramel is yummy with almost any other flavor there!  just remember that what you ask for is what you get-for example, i asked to sample the lavender vanilla ice cream-sounds pretty right....um, yea i think i prefer just the smell of lavender and not eating it!  the coffee is definitely strong in the coffee toffee but good. i love how everything is so organic here...even the cups and spoons used in the store are made of biodegradable, recycled stuff!  awesome! parking is tough here since it's right by dolores park and the line can be long at times.  but at least there's some cool stores and the park to walk to after you get your ice cream.  the staff is very friendly and helpful in recommending what two ice cream flavors would go good together.  the store itself is pretty small inside with only about 4 stools to sit on while licking away your ice cream.

Not bad as a gelato/ice cream tasting fusion but the place is called Bi-Rite "Creamery." Where was the cream?  It tasted like the "ice cream" was made with skim milk.  Can't knock the creative flavors though; I enjoyed those but just wasn't overly impressed by the "ice cream."

No wonder this place is rated as one of the top ice creameries in America...because the ice cream flavors are unique and yummy.  Although, I didn't enjoy the chocolate coconut ice cream because it was icy since it isn't made from milk.  BUT the reason I give this place 5-stars is all because of the OLIVE OIL ice cream.  It sounds kind of weird, but it is very creamy and melts in your mouth.  You can't really taste the olive oil, but you'll get hints of it as you are eating it. Buy a pint of olive oil ice cream and eat it with nutella...mmm...IT IS THE BEST!

I am now officially addicted to Bi-Rite Creamery.  The first time I went there, I had a Sundae with toasted coconut ice cream, and snickerdoodle ice cream and caramelized bananas.  They topped it with hot fudge toasted walnuts too.  It was to die for!  A few days later I went to Bi-Rite market and bought a pint of Snickerdoodle and Roasted banana ice cream to keep in my refrigerator so I can sneak a taste of Bi-Rite ice cream every day.  I love you Bi-Rite Creamery!

While everything i have ever heard about bi-rite has been a raving review or more, I didn't really care for the lavender honey ice cream. I thought the lavender flavor was a bit too strong and the honey was hardly there, if any to be found. I love lavender and the flavor of it, but it wasn't soft, it was a bit overpowering. I wish I could have given it a 4.5 or something higher, because they deserve more than just a 4...On the other hand, the BROWN SUGAR with caramelized ginger was outstanding. The people there are super nice, super helpful, and very patient with a newbie like me.

Bi-Rite is the shit. I've been hearing about this place and meaning to come here for years, but never made a trip out of it or tried to figure out where exactly it was. I was leaving Teachers for Social Justice at Mission High and then I saw a fat line for this ice cream shop so I was like I might as well. Then I got to the front of the line and the sign said "Bi-Rite" and I was like 'oh what, this is Bi-Rite". Salted Caramel was insane, maybe the best scoop of ice cream I have ever had - super rich and deep flavors, someone else said buttery and I would agree with that. That was the top of my cone, on the bottom I asked for Toffee Coffee and that was really good too.

Tried the Mint Chip, Roasted Banana, Balsamic Strawberry, and Salted Caramel. The mint chip was normal. Roasted Banana wasn't bad; you can definitely taste the real banana flavor. The balsamic strawberry was great as well. The salted caramel, hoping that it would be as great as yelp reviewers stated was not enjoyed by the three of us; the first bite was super sweet then came the bitter aftertaste. Maybe the salted caramel is an acquired taste...just not for me.

The texture of their ice cream is so unique! It's super soft and creamy. And the salted caramel lives up to all the hype!!! Definitely a must get! I also had the honey lavender. After the salted caramel, it just seemed bland, but up til then, I enjoyed it. For those scared of floral ice creams and have visions of eating floral sachets, don't be afraid to try it! I've seen a couple of references to Ici in the East Bay, so just my own little observations: 1) Bi-Rite is smooth and creamy, almost like softserve, whereas Ici has the more traditional ice cream texture, more solid. 2) the flavors at Ici are more intense, have more bite...however you want to phrase it. For example, I've had a lavendar combo flavor at Ici before and it was just like smelling a jar of lavendar salts. Intense! Whereas the honey lavendar at Bi-Rite was subtle and more easy on the palate. Both places are great, I personally prefer Bi-Rite though.

Now, I have had balsamic strawberry, vegan coconut chocolate, vegan strawberry sorbet,  roasted banana, cherry almond, salted caramel, and who can remember what else. There really isn't anything bad to say about this place. After coming here at 10:30 on a Friday night (parking was ridiculous), the line moved very rapidly, and the servers were extremely friendly and willing to offer samples. $2.25 for a perfectly adequate kid's size cup. Really, there isn't anything to complain about; suck it Mitchell's fan-boys. Bi-Rite is clearly the better creamery.

The first time I went to check them out was on a Saturday night and the line was down the block and around the corner. That's a good sign that but there was no way I'm going to wait in a line that long for ice cream. I ended up going back during an early evening on a weekday and only had to wait behind 15 or so people. I'm almost glad I had to wait because it took me awhile looking at all their unique flavors of the day to choose what I was going to try. Bi-Rite actually has two entrances, one is for regular soft serve and baked goods (there's no lines there) and the other is for the hard stuff. The people there were young, hip, and friendly and didn't at all rush me and didn't mind letting me sample a couple flavors. The ice cream wasn't completely hard, which is actually ideal because the it gives a smoother texture with more pronounced flavors. The portions were on the smaller side and the prices were a tad high but this is high demand artisan ice cream so it's fairly justified. Of the 18 flavors available when I went, most of them were out of the ordinary: Salted Caramel, Balsamic Strawberry, Roasted Banana, Malted Vanilla w/ peanut brittle and chocolate, Brown Sugar w/ ginger caramel swirl, Creme Fraiche, Chocolate Coconut, Honey Lavender, Brown Butter Pecan, PB&J (w/ blackberry jam), Ricanelas (cinnamon), and Toasted Coconut

all natural, seasonally flavored creamy decadent ice cream, made right there, in house.  they let you taste as much as you want, and even have a frequent buyer card.  you can bet i grabbed one of dem. on a hot day, go to bi-rite ice cream, then head over to dolores park to chill.  you should've seen the lines on the 4th of July!  oh lordy lordy.

Came here at 9:30pm on a Saturday night and there was NO LINE.  SCOREEEEEEE!  Their Rincanellas is amazeballs and the Roasted Banana is the best banana flavored thing I've ever had that wasn't an actually banana.  Their Coffee Toffee Sundae was super bomb too.  I picked up a package of the Hazelnut Thumbprint cookies, and they were nice and chewy with a delicious sweet filling.  Bi-Rite has made a follower out of me.

The one thing holding me back from not giving this place a one-star is the authenticity of the ice cream itself, but here goes the cons. parking is a bitch. the wait is horrendously long (30 min) especially in the cold ass weather. do not come here if you don't make it in time to stand in line by 10pm, cause they will have some person holding up a stupid "open/close" sign to block off people from the closed side. LAME. prices are overly priced for its quality, go to mitchell's instead. basically super overrated. this place, like any other places will pay yelp to put up the good reviews on top so you guys can't read the bad experiences. i basically found parking right smack in front of the place, oh how i felt lucky. decided to line up and stupid guy decides to say no, even to a nice girl who asked politely. don't think of getting any of my business and any referrals; plenty of other places with better price, quality, and especially service.

crème fraîche ice cream?!? who has that!?! well apparently bi-rite does. along with such other delicious flavors as honey lavender, almond cranberry, cinnamon snickerdoodle, ginger and salted caramel. hot damn! basically what i'm getting at here is that we tried a LOT of ice cream and it was all fantastic. nothing tasted artificial or over the top. the flavors were spot on, with my personal favorites being the créme fraîche and the snickerdoodle. NOM! i must pause my praise to point out that my boyfriend ordered the sorbet and was quite disappointed. i, however, maintain that anyone who chooses sorbet over ice cream is clearly a fool and deserves to be punished.

If you're bored of the usual plain flavors, this is one of those place you want to check out. They definitely have some unique flavors like salted carmel, honey lavender, and I believe there was something with olive oil. Wait.. what? olive oil in ice cream??? Wierd but interesting. I had the Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces and wow it was good. Decent price for a typical scoop size, but the quality is definitely there. I don't even want to think about nutrition when it comes to something this creamy. Just enjoy and think about it later. Though I do have to say... parking is hell in that area. I almost wanted to ditch my car in the middle of the road since I got really fed up with driving around in circles.

I love an ice cream shop with unique flavors, and Bi-Rite definitely has an array of interesting choices besides the old standards. The salted caramel. toasted coconut and honey lavender all looked promising, but I ultimately went with the roasted banana, since I love most anything banana-flavored. This was hands down, the best banana ice cream I've ever had! It was a great balance of creamy and a little salty, with flecks of banana all over it. Definitely not your standard Runts-esque boring banana. My partner went with mint chocolate chip, and thought it was pretty great as well. We took our cones down to Mission Dolores Park, which is right around the corner, and enjoyed every bit. Plus, for homemade ice cream, a single scoop in a cone didn't break the bank!

I love their ice cream but you guys really need to start selling this stuff at other outlets like Whole Foods.  This way, us Peninsula people don't have to drive our gas-guzzling SUVs to the city and get looked at the wrong way because we're murdering the environment.  Well, it's all YOUR fault Bi-Rite.  Either start selling the salted caramel at WF in San Mateo or stop selling it altogether so I don't have to keep coming up there. While you're at it, tell Tartine to do the same with the lemon tart.  What assholes.  Keeping all that good stuff to yourselves.

Unbeknownst (Movie reference anyone?) to my knowledge I had already been here once before without realizing; I vaguely remember it was following the MP3 Experiment held in Dolores Park when ImprovEverywhere was in town. There is ALWAYS a line to this tiny creamery, but they damn well deserve it. You salivate as each customer comes out with their creamy smooth ice cream. The flavors are posted right outside the door, so before you make it to the front of the line, make sure you pick out your top five choices, so you can sample them before making your final decision. I tried a little bit of the Salted Caramel one and that was overwhelmingly sweet for me; to me, it seemed like an acquired taste, more like an acquired sweet tooth, personally, I lack one of those. I opted for the Earl Grey, which was extremely fragrant in Earl Grey fragrancy and the taste was just amazing! You can smell the infused lavender and black tea; it's unlike that of your ordinary green tea ice cream, which doesn't taste like green tea at all. The Meyer Lemon was, also, perfect. Smooth, creamy and the perfect tartness, I absolutely loved it. The short version: Meyer Lemon: Yum! Perfect balance of sweet and sour with an additional thumbs up for making a fruity flavor, creamy! Earl Grey: Delish! Sweet essences of the tea linger on your tongue and make you crave for more Salted Caramel: Please, don't hurt me for saying this. But it is definitely not something I would order again. They have a Vegan Banana choice and I've heard amazing things about it. I will definitely be coming back for more, especially for post-game-heartbreak-sorrow-drowning goodness. Btw, if you like the extra protein, make sure the guy smacks the bug that flew into the freezer above the flavor you're planning on engulfing. My friend found some critters legs in his ice cream, but that was okay, it was still AH-MAZING! Five stars even with the bug incident! HAHAHAHAHA!

i finally made it tonight!!! tried to plan my day to make sure i made it there today.........would have loved to walk around licking my cone in the sun this afternoon in the mission (that would be a happy peaceful moment in my own world for me),  but ended getting it after dinner & eating it in the car............... tried a sample of roast banana (pretty good), 16th st. honey lavendar (hmmm....good but wasn't feeling it at the moment) & salty caramel.........i went with the salty caramel (that was really tastee, couldn't stop mmm-mmm-ing after each lick) -- husband thought the salty caramel tasted like green tea icecream (i guess, stop ruining my happy ice cream moment).  picked up a chocolate chip cookie & a toffee cookie -- have yet to try tonight.   pleasantly surprised as i didn't realize they had other treats (packaged cookies, macaroons, chocolate bars) on the side as you walk in,  on the side of the counter (ice cream cakes, ice cream sandwiches -- should've gotten one, that sounds good right about NOW  & pre-packaged pints) & near the cash register (chocolate souffle cakes, chocolate caramel ganache cake).......... well i'll be back for more ice cream flavors & treats........... can't say they beat mitchell's, still love mitchell's UPDATE:  love the rituals coffee toffee w/ salted caramel, need to go back & try the sundaes!! UPDATE #2:  oh my!!!!! those 'lil macaroons in a bag were divine...... they're definitely not your typical coconut macaroons........they're marzipan macaroons --- if you love marzipan, you'll love these......cause that's all you taste with the very soft  moist texture of very fine coconuts.........i guess, not completely sure if there's coconuts........ UPDATE #3 (01-03-08):   OMFG!!!!!!!!   just discovered  my other crack-at-the-moment fix:  ICE CREAM SANDWICH -- the one with chocolate walnut cookies with their vanillla ice cream --TO DIE FOR!!!!!!!!!   (my 1st crack-at-the-moment are those 'lil miette macaroons)   oh and re: update #2, the macaroons i had at that time were almond macaroons & NOT coconut (which they do have).  they have almond macaroons during jewish holidays (not sure why.)   i will have to say that the miette macaroons definitely top bi-rite's almond macaroons.........

This is now verging on ridiculous, this relationship I've developed with Bi-Rite. Have lost count of how many times I've been here in the last couple months. And I assure you, that's not a good thing when the product being sold is this creamy and addictive. Each time we arrive here, I'm practically giddy with excitement just thinking about what new delights are waiting to be discovered. My latest craze is the brown sugar ginger caramel.

How good is this ice cream? Good enough that we served Bi-Rite ice cream cakes as our wedding cake. Good enough that prior to serving Bi-Rite ice cream cake as our wedding cake, we did a "test run" where we bought a cooler and dry ice to test how long the cake would remain frozen on a trip down to the south bay. Good enough that my husband and I have driven an hour each way from the south bay and back just to buy a pint to bring home. Bi-rite is basically as good as ice cream gets. Texture - perfect. Creaminess- perfect. Flavors-great. The only negative thing I can say about Bi-rite is that they don't rotate flavors, and I'm generally one to really enjoy variety. However, I like the honey lavender flavor enough that I don't actually mind getting the same thing every single time I go there. In the ice cream rankings of the Bay, Bi-Rite has been at the top of my list for a while. Better than Ici, better than Humphrey Slocombe. The only other place I think is a possible contender is the fairly new Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous... but I have to go back a few more times to make my final judgement on that one. Another nice thing about Bi-rite is that their spoons and cups are compostable. 10 points to Gryffindor for being green.

What can I say about a place with over 4000 reviews that hasn't been said already? I came around 11:30am so there was no line. I had their famous salted caramel ice cream and the balsamic strawberry ice cream as well. The former definitely lived up to its reputation. As for the latter, I could not taste the balsamic vinegar at all. Just tasted like regular strawberry to me. The price is quite good for such a well-known place. $3.25 for two scoops and they accept credit cards. The customer service is quite good. I was offered many samples and given many recommendations when I told the worker that it was my first time there.

My favorite ice cream in SF. Expensive, but worth it because it tastes so yummy. The only bummer is the long line you wait in to get your ice cream.

I had to give 4 stars because my 5 stars only belong to Mitchell's ice cream.   My friend was raving about this place and she told me she had to take me here so I can try it.  Parking sucks here and we went on a weeknight!  I mean that's a given because it is the city, but that give Mitchell's ice cream the edge because they have parking over there.  Anyway, so we decided to park infront of the house next door and I went to buy the ice cream while my friend waited for me in the car. No line this time because it was pretty cold and a weeknight.  I sampled the lavender, but I wasn't sold.  It tasted like a... flower, lol.  So I got the roasted banana and salted caramel.  My friend got the snickerdoodle and I  forgot the other flavor with whipped cream.  I didn't get the whipped cream to avoid more calories (ha!) and I'm not really a fan of whipped cream.  But after tasting their whipped cream, I was sold!  It's made by them and it's soooo yummy!  It's like another ice cream flavor!   I recommend put ting whipped cream on your ice cream, and it was complete your experience! Roasted banana was yum.  Salted caramel was yum.  Although I noticed later on that it was hard for me to swallow the salted caramel, but I still kept on eating coz of the flavor.  It just felt strong in my throat.   I'd definitely come back here, but might have to take the bus or park somewhere really far, heheh.

wow, how have I not already reviewed this place with its sweet sweet ice cream action? I love the wackier flavors at Humphrey Slocombe, but the quality of the ice cream here is much higher. I'm always torn between Ricanelas (cinnamon ice cream with specks and chunks of snickerdoodles) v. Salted Caramel (smoky buttery caramel with salty flecks of mmmmhhmm). And then I always top it off with whatever tea flavor they have or orange cardamom. Earl Grey somehow makes an awesome ice cream flavor. Lines on hot days can wrap around the block and even on drizzling cloudy cold nights, there will be six or seven cheery people waiting in line. Soft serve kiosk is a little ways down the block.

Yes the line was around the corner but it was a relatively warm Sat afternoon so we expected it. Time went by quickly though. The place is tiny tiny w/only a few tables inside but we still managed to snag one inside. Outside, I was able to gawk at what other people ordered and it all looked yummy. My husband wasn't planning on getting anything as he's not a huge sweets type, but when he sampled the basil and lavender, he got some as well. I had the toffee coffee and salted caramel and it was just so yum.

I found Bi-Rite after my family and I decided to do an ice cream-venture. Bi-Rite was our first stop, and boy I was hooked! In fact it was unanimously all on our #1 spot. Despite my disgust when I tried the Sam's Sundae (the Olive Oil made my tongue itchy), the Roasted Banana, Salted Caramel, Toasted Coconut, Coffee Toffee, Ricanelas, and Afternoon Sundae made me such a fan. I will return over and over, and it doesn't matter how long the line is.

YUM! Had the salted caramel and honey lavender ice cream - both were delicious! I've been burned by salted caramel ice cream before - being too salty that I could only eat half. But Bi-rite's has a good balance of salty and sweet, with a slight burnt taste. So good!  Will go back again, though, I'm hoping that the line wouldn't be around the corner next time.

I was so stoked to coming here after the Seward slides but damn I circled the area for 20 minutes trying to find a parking spot and I could. So i risked parking in front of a hydrant and and running in to get my ice cream. Salted caramel and strawberry (something). The ice cream was good but not worth getting a ticket over. I still prefer Mitchell's.

Amazing ice cream and the salted caramel is a MUST!  When you come to visit, don't drive (the parking is non-existent) and if it's a nice day in the park save time and buy a pint (you can skip the line and walk straight up to the register).

Bi-Rite Creamery often has long lines on weekends, but its totally worth it. The ice cream flavors are much more interesting than any creamery I've been to. Its hard to describe what makes it so good, but its very clear when you taste it Sea Salt Caramel (5 stars) - The best is their signature sea salt caramel. Its noticeably salty so some less adventurous souls may not love it, but if you're looking for a new experience, this is the best one I've had. Its sweet, but also somewhat smoky.  Its really well balanced.  Brown butter pecan (4 stars) - It is like the best butter pecan you've had, but with the burnt smoky flavor that makes browned butter different from butter. Halfway through though it became a little overwhelming and tasted more like a more familiar butter pecan. Lavender honey (3 stars) - It was very interesting, but for my tastes, the lavender was just too strong and could have been better balanced with more honey flavor. Lavender can taste a little soapy and it tastes a little too soapy in this ice cream. Roasted Banana (4 stars) - This flavor starts out strong and interesting. Its never that fake candy banana flavor of other ice creams, but the roasted aspect comes through stronger at the beginning. By the time I was done with my kids cup though, it seemed a little more ordinary. Chai spiced milk chocolate (5 stars) - This one is just terrific. It has a very strong chai tea flavor that is all the better because it doesn't overwhelm the chocolate, yet it very potent. Milk chocolate describes it well because it is sweet and creamy, but not a really strong rich chocolatey flavor. One of my favorites. Mint chip (3 stars) - I don't like mint much so take this with a grain of sea salt. Its just fine, but by Bi-Rite standards, not that interesting and not better than other places. The mint is pretty strong and the chocolate chunks are pretty large. Peanut Butter with fleur de sel nuggets (5 stars) - I've tried this one but I don't know why I haven't ordered it because it was really great. I thought it might be too peanut buttery, but the taste I had was really impressive and I wish I had gotten it tonight instead of the roasted banana. Malted Vanilla with Peanut Butter (4 stars) - Tried a few bites of this one and really liked it. The malted part of the vanilla adds a lot and the peanut butter chunks were enjoyable.

despite the nippy december chill, the grand tales of bi-rite ice cream drew me ever near. i tried the salty caramel (omg so good!), coffee toffee (makes me wanna stay up all night so i can get my ice cream on!), and lavender honey (like eating a flower).  one price, two flavors, and one very satisfied customer. can't wait to come back here and try EVERYTHING! i've been told the strawberry balsamic (which they didn't have when we went) is also very good. the tasting spoons are real metal (so that they can be washed and reused) and the ice cream "spoons" are little wooden paddles like you had in grade school.  how very eco-friendly SF hippie of them...

I came here after a very filling lunch and told myself I would get the smallest size but it's just not possible.  Go big or go home so I went double and got a scoop of the best thing I've ever tasted in my life, coffee toffee as well as the brown butter pecan.  Both amazing but I could get the coffee toffee all day, everyday.

on a hot day, this place is completely san francisco. on my day off, i happened to be sunning in dolores right after some ethiopian food in haight with some of my friends for lunch. the night before was crazy as hell, but we downed some water and took some pictures at dolores and everything seemed perfect. but what could make it even more perfect? two scoops of cookies and cream from this little heaven around the corner. it was such a hot day today, and so many people were strolling past our spot into the park with their bi-rite cones. somehow, no other place can make it quite like they can. i walked back to 16th and guerrero, and i couldn't stop smiling with my ice cream in my hand. i just feels that good. ;]

with 301 reviews already posted as i write this, what's more to be said that hasn't been said? well, how about this? it is great to have locally made ice cream. i do appreciate it. when i lived in philly i lived around the corner from a great place called "more than just ice cream", and it was death for my waistline. hell, i had a cone on my wedding day, ostensibly for good luck. of course the next morning we hit a deer on the way to her parent's place and four years later we were separated. so much for the positive talismanic effect of good ice cream. anyway...i was talking about bi-rite...what was my point? right...locally made ice cream=good. and this certainly is pretty good ice cream. it's just not the mouth-orgasm that you want it to be for the money they charge ($8 for a pint? wtf?!?). still, it's good. and close (on my way home from bart). and i'd never ever before had salted caramel. and they use local products, which i do love. so for that and for the fact that  i've made a vow (what is it with me wrt vows and ice cream?) to only get never-eaten flavors from them...well, i'm glad they're in the 'hood.

When I grow up, I want to be an ice cream server for Bi-Rite Creamery so that I'll never have to choose only two flavors of ice cream at a time. *snaps back into reality* Given that I'm already grown up and like my current job as well, I'll have to settle for being a frequent customer - on a face recognition basis with one of the workers - at this ice cream store. The staff is incredibly friendly and always willing to give suggestions to customers about ice cream flavors and/or good combinations. They don't ever seem to mind it when customers take an extra long time sampling to make up their minds. This is why they're hired as servers and I'm not because it's annoying to have my ice cream delayed by the indecisiveness. I've tried almost all their flavors except the ginger and that's only because it's just ginger and nothing else to buffer the flavor. While Mitchell's specializes in tropical flavors, Bi-Rite specializes in combining All-American classics like snicker doodle or brown butter pecan. While it's near impossible to choose a favorite flavor - as hard as it is to choose your favorite child - I am partial to salted caramel and malted vanilla with peanut brittle.  Their cookies are good too and given their small size, you'll even think that the cookie can fit into your diet. I'd avoid the one that's all dark (looks like it's complete chocolate) because that's a chocolate cookie with bacon bits. It isn't bad and it's true that bacon makes the world go round but I have different uses for the money that the cookie used up, such as a banana split sundae. They caramelize the banana with a blow torch right in front of you! Please don't go during the hours of 4:00 pm through 9:30 pm as you seriously delay my ability to devour ice cream as soon as humanly possible.

Upon walking in, I knew I was in for a treat (no pun intended.) They even had a "Yelp Loves Us!" sticker displayed prominently in the front.

Came here on a warm Sunday afternoon and the line was wrapped around the corner.  It's right next to Dolores Park so when you get your ice cream, take it over to the park and enjoy the sunshine.  for $3.25, you can get a small cup but pick either 1-2 flavors.  I picked Coffee Toffee and Toasted Coconut and I loved both!!  It was definitely worth the wait.  You can really taste the coffee and toffee bits!  Probably the best ice cream I've ever had!

Everytime I visited you I had the salted caramel, although I must admit I have a secret obsession with the lavender as well. I came here before lunch, before dinner and after dinner, and then once again before we went to the airport...in fact, we almost missed our flight because I insisted on one more cup of your amazingness.

quality you can taste!  i loved the texture of the ice cream and the unexpected flavors.  i had sam's sundae and my husband got his usual cookies and cream along with salted caramel. my favorite was the salted caramel.  i was worried that it might taste too sweet given that it's caramel, but it was just right.  my sundae was a bit too strong on my taste buds.   however, it's a great combination of flavors.  i especially loved the chocolate ice cream.  next time i think i'll ask that they put less of the bergamont oil and salt.   we made a 45 minute drive to see what all the hype was about.  we got there around 6pm on a wednesday and there were just a couple of people ahead of us....phew, thank goodness 45 mins of anticipation is long enough. i'm so glad we made the drive, this place sure lives up to the hype.

I really LOVE the strange exotic flavors that they offer in this shop. I believe I may have gotten the ice cream called Honey Lavender and the Salted Caramel. Like Mitchells, this ice cream shop also offers a wide variety of flavors, although in terms of originality, I would say that Bi-Right may win this round. Mitchells always seems to carry the same standard flavors with a couple of exceptional new flavors introduced every now and then. Bi-Right has a lot more unique flavors to offer. Now I am not saying I like Bi-Right more than Mitchells because both hold a special place in my heart. The only thing that deters me from coming to this place is that its almost impossible to find parking and that the line is insane. It can extend to about a block (or maybe a little less). But regardless of the line, the workers here are extremely friendly and happy (it amazes me). Do check this place out if you're willing to try new flavors.

I pedalled by Bi-Rite Creamery yesterday afternoon after throwing back a few with my friend Rob at the 500 Club.  On a typical day, I actively avoid lines, which explains the infrequency of stopping here for cold cream.  For som bizarre reason, at the moment I cruised by a line was nowhere to be seen, so I quick as a whip locked my bike to the nearest post and stepped in.  One minute later I stepped out holding salted caramel and creme fraiche in my hand.  My stars what a good flavor that caramel is!  I could not stop licking it - Jenna Jamison would have been proud.  People waiting in the newly formed line did nothing to conceal their discomfort.  They appeared to be watching a user shoot up on smack, and they were!  Bi-Rite salted caramel is the herion of San Francisco ice creams.

Dear readers of the world, you have not lived until you've stopped by Bi-Rite Creamery in San Francisco. I am totally kicking myself in the ass for not knowing about this place until now when I've lived in the city for 19 years. All their ice-cream is homemade right upstairs fromt heir store front with all natural ingredients. Softer than ice-cream but harder than gellato and ultimately - HEAVEN ON EARTH.

I *think* this is the most reviewed place on yelp! Sort of overhyped, but it is a hipster joint in SF so if you wonder where the 4000+ reviews came from, yeah. Wasn't bad or anything though, I still recommend paying this place a visit lol I got the Honey Lavender and the Salted Caramel flavors in the Single cup($3.25). The Honey Lavender was great, as it was a perfect balance of sweet honey and herbal flavors. The salt in the Salted Caramel was overpowering instead of bringing out the caramel flavor like it is supposed to. I know you can make ice cream with salt, but you're supposed to put a lot of salt on the outside of the ice cream maker, not the inside!  Thankfully I had bottled water in my car lol. It's pretty cool how they give you unlimited samples to try though. Parking here is horrendous btw. I think I ended up parking illegally and blocked off half or more of some poor dude's driveway. Sorry!

Even though sometimes you get there and only want one scoop. You come to realize that after all this waiting in line you just have to go for it so I always end of getting another. My second favorite flavor is the Coffee Toffee. Get your ice cream and head over to the park!

I honestly don't understand why one afternoon there can be no line and another one around the corner. I've been to this place twice, the first time I tried the salted caramel, I gotta admit, it was pretty good! I mean, I wouldn't scream out that it was amazing but it was satisfying. The second time I tried it, I had the brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl and the balsamic strawberry. The strawberry was really good, the brown sugar just tasted like liquid sugar with an occasional "oh, there's the ginger!". I didn't really like the honey lavender, it tasted like I was eating soap, had plenty of that as a kid. No thanks. Tried to come a third time but for some reason the line was extremely long! Probably because it was a weekend. If anything, I'll come back on a weekday around noon.

Hands down the best ice cream I've ever had. To make the wait worth it, try as many flavors as you can before pissing off the employees.  That way, you can really get a sense for how ridiculously good every flavor is.  I went with the salted caramel and ricanelas. I may or may not go back and buy a pint today.

this place is really ironic. who would have guessed an ice cream shop that has a line coming out of it and going down the block every night? really its true. the great thing about it, is that my best friend lives right accross the street. literally. so it helps. i would say 90% of the time i go over to her house we go to bi-rite. everyone knows there ice cream is amazing, but why? what makes it so great? i mean sure its creative. who else has salted caramel ice cream? no to many places. your not getting that at cold stone. thats for sure. i enjoy this place because its close to the park, and hey, and ice cream shop next to a park?! you cant really go wrong there. every flavor i have had from bi-rite has been amazing. i havent tried them all, but someday i hope i will. the only reason i am not giving them 5 stars is because of the crazy lines. sure i know that is not their fault, but still it effect the way i feel about the business. all i can say to those bi-rite folks is thanks. thanks for taking the time to make some amazing ice cream for me and all the other folks in this city.

We took a sunday drive last night and Yelped a ice cream parlor and it was the 1st one to pop up and open late 2 good things. We ordered 2 Banana splits(loved the carmalized bananas) and a make your own sundae. OMG we were so happy with our purchase. Really inexpensive and very tasty the person who served us was so nice she offered free samples. There was one rude lady who helped my sister and she just seemed to be irritated with work those people are annoying in like the cashier was cool too. Can't get em all right.

After all this talk about Bi-Rite amongst friends, I had been anxious to stop by... Needless to stay I was thrilled and the sweets met everyone one of my expectations! There were an abundance of interesting and delicious sounding flavors. If there wasn't such a long line behind me (at 10pm mind you), I would have sampled all of them!  I ended up getting: 1) Creme Freshe (sp?)!!!  So deliciously slurpiful... Im drooling right now just thinking about it. 2) Salted Caramel: really delicious, gets a little sweet towards the end but perfect combined with other flavors. 3) Butter Pecan (I think it was called something different actually): good but I was still obsessed mostly with #1. I cannot wait to go back and try all the other flavors! Not looking forward to the line all the way around the block though... + it is quite pricey for the amount you get. Oh well, won't stop me!

DELICIOUS! I was wary about this place. I had heard the line is ALWAYS long, which by the way it is, but worth it!  BELIEVE the reviews.... even if it sounds weird you MUST try the "Salted Carmel"... It is the best and this is coming from someone who usually likes Vanilla ice cream.

Wow. I think from rating this 5 stars, I'll probably have to demote a couple  other reviews of mine. This takes 5 stars to another level. I tried a douple scoop cup with pumpkin, ricanllas, and malted vanilla. It was the best ice cream I've had in decades. And between Bi-Rite and Mitchell's, Bi-Rite wins the flavor wars hands down. yumm

The best ice creamery in town. I have not found any place better. I like the salted caramel and ricanelas flavors the best. I go there almost every time I when I have the chance. I have been going there for years. Moreover, the quality of their products have remained consistently great. It is well made and the product presentation is good. At other places the ice cream is too soft or too hard, too sugary or they have  ice chips in it. Most of the flavors are pretty good and have the right amount sweetness, creaminess, and flavor intensity and complexity needed to make consuming the product enjoyable. The selection of flavors are good, some flavors are exotic. Though, not as exotic as the Bombay ice creamery. I highly reccomend this place.

This place is great. The only gripe that I have is the smaller portions / big prices. The line is usually long outside for the ice cream but moves pretty fast. Most people don't know there is soft serve at the next counter  beyond the line. Usually there is no line there and they only have 3 or 4 different flavours to choose from.

what more needs to be said? but i cannot contain my personal joy, so i will still add to the glowing reviews. salted caramel - just do it, dammit. roasted banana - i'm not a usually a big fan of banana, but i love the flavor that shines through in this one. malted vanilla (with some bits and pieces of almonds or something-something in it, can't remember) - basic, but pretty good. has that obvious malty taste, which i really do appreciate. honey lavender - light and fragrant, i enjoyed this. love having this in a mix of 3-4 flavors, because it makes the segue in taste really apparent. balsamic strawberry - was really looking forward to this one, but unfortunately when i had it, it tasted like straight up strawberry. fresh and tasty, nonetheless, but was expecting more of the balsamic body and kick to it. eager to try out the other flavors, but i won't complain either if i just stuck to these five all the way through. the line can be long, but it moves quickly. get a cup/cone and head over to dolores park in these sunny days. one of the simple, brilliant pleasures in life.

Today its getting quite warm. Its 515pm...and I can't wait to rush home from work and get a scoop of bi rite icecream. I used to think, "WOW. salted caramel...yummm" but iv'e converted. Now, anytime the weather tops 70 degrees...i think "MUST HAVE orange cardamom!!!" Oh, it is truly divine. There's fresh orange zest, a light refreshing taste, but unlike any other orange confection. unlike sherbert, unlike creamsicles, unlike jambajuice orange dreammachine with a protein blast.   you all remember the moment when the food critic in Ratatouille the pixar film eats the ratatouille, and is instantly transported back to a warm childhood memory? This icecream does it for me. My fave ice cream ever.

Over 2000 reviews, what more can I add? Just a note: if you love Bi-Rite so much that you want to introduce this to your family during Thanksgiving break/family reunion in a different state, you can! I simply googled something to the effect of "Can I bring ice cream on a plane?" and I got detailed explanations from some guy who had the same idea: transporting Bi-Rite to loved ones via air. Following his explicit instructions, I got me some dry ice and 4 pints of Bi-Rite and convinced TSA (Nov 2009) that it was okay for me to go on a flight with my precious goodies. It worked! In conclusion, Bi-Rite is so good, that I risked an evening spent with TSA at SFO to introduce Salted Caramel to my family. Thank God they loved it too. (FYI: If TSA was going to confiscate my ice cream, my backup plan was to have a friend who happened to be in the area, swing by SFO to pick it up and consume it to his delight. There is no way I'm letting that ice cream go to waste!)

We tried the salted caramel, balsamic strawberry, and the toasted banana.  They were all beyond my expectation!!  Though this place does not have the variety of Mitchell's, which is also one of my favorites, BiRite makes up in quality.  The sundays are crafted like deserts in a fancy restaurant.  I recommand going there in odd hours for easier parking and to avoid lines around the block.

My friend Precious Jade and I came here for much needed ice cream therapy after a long day of data collection and an exam.  We had just enjoyed a smorgie at My Tofu House and were looking forward to a nice dessert.  I had a scoop of salted caramel paired with butter pecan, and savored ever bite of it.  Absolute confectionery perfection!  PJ enjoyed her trio of brown sugar, coffee toffee, and salted caramel. It was well worth the wait in a longish line.

Let me be the 2151st person to state that Bi-Rite creamery is delicous. Sure, it's pricey, sure it's a yuppie den, but just suck it up and enjoy some delicious iced cream, friends.

The location is totally perfect since its right next to Dolores. The decor is very cute and quirky. I had such a hard time deciding becuase all the flavors sounded so interesting. I got a few samples and ended up with a scoop of the brown sugar with ginger caramel and a scoop of the coffee toffee. Both were so delicious. The brown sugar was so buttery and sweet and was perfect. The coffee toffee had a strong coffee flavor (which I like) but the chunks of toffee gave it a sweet balance. So yummy :)

The appeal of the funky flavors or of the combinations of 2-3 different flavors, quickly wears off once you get the bill and once you taste it. The bill is memorable, the taste is a-ok and not memorable. Perhaps they should experiment with a greater proportion of whole milk to cream, and/or make it less fatty - and more memorable!

Honey Lavender ice cream... mmm creamy, light, yet flavorful. Their cupcakes however... not up to par. However, it could be because I went in the early evening and I had the lonely ones that were left out till the end of the day. I'll give four stars simply because with all their popularity, they should really invest in some extra seating outside. I love where it's located (I pretty much just love SF) and I am going to go back at an earlier time in the day to get an ice cream/cupcake combo!

Banana ice cream straight up has a creamy delicious banana flavor.   Mix it up with that chocolate - now we talkin' Their flavors are all very unique and delicious!  Seriously - all the flavors are an explosion in yo mouth! It's NOT like some regular ice cream place that proclaims "the best" because they mastered Nutella Ice Cream.   Bi-Rite makes a SALTED caramel flavor that can rock your socks off! There is a reason that their line is super long and roped off.  The size is affordable and filling because of the creamy texture.  It's freakin' gooooooooood!

I had the balsamic strawberry and ricanela ice cream and my boyfriend had the roasted banana and toasted coconut ice cream and they were all good. The ones that stood out were the roasted banana and the ricanela. I did try the the honey lavender and although it was good, I can't get over that lavender potpourri taste. On another note, the people working here were so nice! One guy kept asking me what else I wanted to try.  Overall, I really like this place and I look forward to coming back and trying more flavors!

I will add my seal of approval to Bi-Rite. The place smelled delicious and sweet and yummy, and the selection (while limited) was very exotic. I'm not a huge ice cream person, but I craved a 4 scoop cone so that I could sample all the delicious flavors. And about the long line, I live near Swensen's which has sub-par ice cream and there's always a long line there too. If you're going to stand in line for ice cream, this is the place to do it....

salted caramel and ricinelas ice cream.  solo or together it's a good time. definitely not your traditional ice cream shop, but the quality of the ice cream is worth your time.  it's always packed, so just expect to wait.  But I really liked it.  I can't wait to go back and try more flavors...even though I might just revert to the two I have already tried, because they were just that good.

As usual the line was out the door but it was worth the wait as it went really quickly.  You can get a generous tasting of the ice cream that you may want when you get inside too...maybe that's why the line is so long.  Anyway, the ice cream was good but I still think that Mitchell's overall is better.  Great for a sunny day in the city though.

Ok - not much to say after over a thousand reviews. Its high quality ice cream served in a cool trendy neighborhood. At almost $4 for a single(which is actually 2 scoops) i wasn't dying to go back for more. The flavors are more inventive than your average Ben and Jerry's, but I found a lot of them to be overly sweet for my palate. The toasted coconut and the malted vanilla with toffee was a bit too overwhelming, but my friend's balsamic strawberry was close to perfection. Its a great place to grab a cone and play with the neighborhood puppies, but for now it will stay an occasional indulgence when I am craving something different. My biggest gripe is the service is a bit brusque. I get that there is a line and some jackass is going to want to sample every flavor or take a million years to commit to their flavor, but treating me like a number and screaming "keep the line moving" makes me feel like I am in the big house and Bubba plans on making me his bitch. Not conducive to a feel good ice cream moment.

Wish I never tried this place because now I'm addicted & don't live in the same 'hood.  I'm an ice cream fiend & Bi-Rite Creamery is to die for.  The texture is creamy but not too soft & airy.  The flavors are unique & robust.  My favs are honey lavendar, salted caramel & malted vanilla.  Love that there's an option to get 2 flavors in a single & 3 in a double.  The cocoa nib shortbread or homemade toffee toppings is over the top!

-Second Update- I have to update again because now that I've been back to Bi-Rite more times than I can remember, I'm a huge fan. What can I say? I was a slow convert. This ice cream is not for those who don't like fresh ingredients and rich, creamy flavor. I haven't had a single sample (or cup or cone) of ice cream that wasn't a great balance of taste and texture. The owner really takes the time to think about her ingredients and flavor combinations. Another thing that's great about Bi-Rite that has nothing to do with its flavor is that everyone who works there is super nice. I would imagine that 1) working at a place like Bi-Rite might make one snobby because...you work at Bi-Rite. Come on. And 2) there's always a long line out the door and people (*cough* including me) always want a number of different samples. You could easily become snippy, snappy, snobby or sullen with customers but these folks don't. They're cheerful and don't hurry you along. -End of Second Update- -Update- I'm updating my review after having gone several more times to Bi-Rite. Like I said before, the ice cream is very creamy and the flavors are interesting, to say the least. Maybe the last time I went, the salted caramel was too salty and the ice cream was too creamy but this time, everything was perfect. May I recommend the salted caramel or the brown butter pecan? I went back after watching a "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" episode where one chef loved Sam's Sundae. The thought of olive oil on ice cream was initially a huge turn off but the more I thought about it, the more appealing it seemed. So the Boyfriend and I went, stood in the long line and finally got to the counter. The chocolate ice cream is the best I've ever had - perfectly textured, perfectly chocolatey, perfectly everything. The salt was overpowering and I made the Boyfriend eat the top layer of ice cream. The olive oil is pretty light and sweet - it's grassy (which is the type of OO I like) and almost citrusy. All in all, I wasn't a huge fan of the sundae but I'm a fan of Bi-Rite! -End of Update- I might lose what little influence I have by giving Bi-Rite three stars but I guess I like my ice cream less creamy. I love that the flavors are unique and the ice cream is handmade and the little things, like using metal spoons to offer tastings so as to cut back on waste makes Bi-Rite memorable. The ice cream is good, don't get me wrong.

i get it.. i get it... its worth the hype!! came into town for the weekend, and my bestie only wanted to talk about this ice cream place.. being a more fro-yo type of gal who is a bit lactose intolerant, i was ehhh about the whole place. but could i be so wrong. first.. yummy. i had the snickerdoodle and the malted vanilla. the snickerdoodle [it had a fancy rufffiiolioni sorta of name, that i can't remember], was yummy. big chunks of cookie and great ratio of cinnamon. the malted vanilla with bits of toffee brittle, was to die for! i also sampled the coffee and the honey lavendar which is just so romantic! it tastes and smells delish and aromatic. love it over and over.. bi-rite definitely bought me into the hype. and definitely worth having a bit uneasy belly for such delishness to hit my palate.

Awesome! We heard about Sam's Sunday from Aida on Food Network. It was pretty interesting, with tropical olive oil (orangey) over two scoops of the richest, deepest chocolate ice cream ever, sprinkled with coarse salt and topped with a dallop of whipped cream. The combo was interesting, the best bites included the chunks of salt. Who knew ice cream and salt were so amazing together? We also tried the balsamic strawberry and the salted caramel. Double yum on those. Creamy, dreamy, and worth the wait.

The cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodle=best I've ever had. The texture alone will blow your mind. I also tried the vegan coconut chocolate and that was good. My BF tried Sam's Sundae as he had seen it on Food Network and it was just too salty... the olive oil part was good, but the sea salt. eh. We just couldn't hang. Everyone was raving about the salted caramel. The roasted banana was good also, but weak flavor.

great interesting flavors ( honey lavender is my favorite). also, i think they may use recipes from David Lebovitz's "Perfect Scoop" which is my favorite ice cream cookbook and they also sell the book there. But this place get VERY crowded,  there is always a line out the door and choosing your flavor is a very rushed experience. As such, there is no place to enjoy your ice cream inside and barely space outside. not their fault but something to consider.

I have to agree the ice cream here is pretty good! And with 1800+ reviews, it says something!! Flavors sound a bit weird, but try it out! It's really good! There's a crazy wait, but luckily, I didn't have to wait because my friends waited in line for me. I'm not sure if I'd wait in line for this stuff. Hence the 4 stars. It is very good however. I had the salted caramel. The "saltiness" is great because it brings out the sweetness of the caramel. I also had the balsamic strawberry. It not  your typical sweet strawberry ice cream, the balsamic sounds weird, but it really adds another layer of flavor to the ice cream, that adds the tartiness. Very good! Thanks friends for waiting in line. There was a poor girl yacking her brain out from drinking too much!! It was only 10:30!! WEAKSAUCE!!!!!!!!!!

Amazing, creative ice creamery with fresh, vibrant flavors to tempt you.  We waited in line for about 20 minutes on a beautiful sunny Saturday afternoon, and it was well worth the wait!  The knowledgeable scoop artists were more than happy to let you sample any of the flavors and make recommendations.  The balsamic strawberry was hands down the best flavor, and the salted caramel was excellent.  Highly recommended!

Some of the best darned ice cream I have ever had!! I opted for the Salted Caramel (the most perfect balance of salty sweets) because it was recommended to me by my foodie sister. Also, everyone else seemed to be doing it as well, I took the popularity of the flavor as a good sign. Is the secret ingredient the ambrosia of the heavens??? because DAYMN that was some GOOD STUFF. It was an insanely hot day and that ice cream sure did hit the spot!! I think the salt content in it made it melt a little faster but that does not matter because you'll be eating it so fast, there isn't time for it to melt much! SO yummy yummy in my tummy. If you're in the neighborhood DEFINITELY check this place out!

this place does not kid around with the strong flavors of their ice cream.  salted caramel was EXTREMELY salty!  a couple of bites and we were done...anymore and we would have to load up on some bottled water.  not our favorite...just a-ok.  we also had a scoop of the ricanelas which i figured would be wonderful because of the snickerdoodle...it was good...very strong with the cinnamon...but much better than the salted caramel.  wifey had a taste of the coffee toffee...once again, extreme in flavor. why the 4 stars?  because the texture was really awesome...similar to a gelato...and the ice cream tasted really fresh.  the salted caramel is on the 7x7 list and i don't understand why...i guess it's something different and unique around the area...but doesn't beat mitchell's.  next time, we'll try the sam's sundae...

I wouldn't dare give this Mission institution a poor review. There was a long line that wasn't an issue on a sunny day. The ice cream is super super rich, so the smallish portions (albeit reasonable price) aren't too small. I really enjoyed the salted caramel, but I wish they had a salted burnt caramel and maybe a gingerbread flavor or salted dark chocolate to complement it. Did NOT go well with the saturated honey lavender... wayy too lavendery for me. I would pair the Salted caramel with a more "regular" chocolate flavor like the cookies and cream. Enjoy!!

Bi-Rite, you're lucky your ice cream is amazing and that you aren't stingy with giving samples and that you didn't have a monster of a line the day I decided to grace you with my presence and that you have such friendly stinkin' service or else I wouldn't have let this incident slide so easily.

Salted Caramel could have perhaps been touched by Jesus from the heavens. Good God, this is heavenly. I don't care how much fat, sugar or 'bad stuff' it has in it, it is way too good to even care.

Came here with my boyfriend one night recently because i was craving ice cream and i wanted to try a new place. Got here and there was a long line maybe because it felt like a summer night. All the flavors on the menu seemed so yummy. We ended up getting salted caramel (recommended by my friend), roasted banana, ricanelas. My favorite was the roasted banana! I wanna come here again despite the fact there might be a long line during summer nights.

FINALLY!! I made it to Bi-Rite. I was confused looking for the place, ended up at Bi Rite the grocery store looking around for a ice cream booth LOL!!! Well finally found the place across the street and down the block and boy was I happy! Then I was so excited I couldn't find the sign of flavors to choose from. Looking everywhere, I see sundaes, size price, but no flavors!! Panic panic it's almost my turn. I look to the FAR left side, oh there it is! So I got the balsamic strawberry and snickerdoodle cinnamon flavors and they were sooo good!!! The density of the ice cream was perfect! Nice and creamy and solid like I like it. I don't like my ice cream to be soft served when it's not called soft serve! I can't wait to go back. I went in the middle of the day on a weekday and it was busy but not weekend crazy line busy.

Have I really not written a review of this place yet?? What on earth has gotten into me? Quite simply, this is the absolute best place for ice cream on the plant. Period. The brown sugar ice cream with the roasted banana ice cream is my fave, although I am also partial to honey lavender. Occasionally, I just want some good ol' chocolate, and that is incredible and rich and creamy, too! I've also gotten their cookies, which are yummy, but the ice-cream is what to come for! Oh, and don't worry about the never-ending line that is a constant here; the line goes really quickly!

If anyone ever visits me, I make sure to take them to Bi-Rite, the icecream darling of San Francisco.  All of their flavors are delicious, but if you must choose on two or three, I would suggest the honey lavender, salted caramel, and earl grey flavors.  The flavors are always well developed but not overpowering, and honed-in well like the icecreams of France and Italy (where I became an icecream and gelato connoisseur).  5 stars, well deserved!

Cupcakes, lunch trucks and now ice cream?  I'm not a big ice cream junkie so I'm not crazy about the idea of standing in long line for ice cream.  However, since this is apparently the hottest thing, how can we resist?   Haha.  Seriously, 15 minutes isn't bad as far as lines go.  Bi-Rite does have some very unique flavors, the most popular being salted caramel.  I also tried the toasted coconut and roasted banana.  They use organic dairy products and  I must say it was all very good.   Despite the crowd, the staff was also very patient with us as we sampled flavor after flavor.   Overall, nice experience.  I suspect one of these or some knock off will be popping up in the Southland soon.

the unique flavors are what sets this place apart from the rest! i've found the best way to really enjoy your favorite flavor is to order it first, so it can be placed in the cone first to enjoy toward the end with the cone. now that i've introduced this to the husband, we leave with a cone each (mine with honey lavender and toasted banana and his with salted caramel and balsamic strawberry) and a quart of brown sugar w/ ginger caramel swirl. i hope to someday surprise him with an ice cream cake.

I'm sorry, but I really don't understand what the big hype is on their ice cream.  Sure, they have unique flavors.  However, it wasn't mind blowing or should I say it didn't blow my taste buds away?  Anyway, I've tried almost all of their flavors and none were great.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible, but I would chose Mitchell's ice cream over this place any day.  It's so much more richer and creamier.  It also doesn't melt as fast.

My favorite flavor is still Balsamic Strawberry, but due newly acquired allergy to strawberries, I can't get my favorite flavor (sad!).  I still think Salted Caramel doesn't live up to its hype, Honey Lavender should be a scent, not a flavor, Roasted Banana & Coffee Toffee are legit.  Didn't get biodegradable spoon & bowl last time I went either.  Things were not as exciting as it used to be, but still good quality ice cream.

Came here for the first time on a trip up north and heard about this place, so we thought we'd give it a try. If you're like other ppl, you might accidentally walk into the local grocery store that SELLS the bi-rite creamery products, but that's not where you want to go, you have to walk further down the street to the actual place where they sell the single serve ice creams...the store only has it in bulk qty.  Just look for the lines, you can't miss it.   Line was fairly long, but goes quick - it's only ice cream.  I had the toasted coconut and roasted banana flavors, which were really good. Finz had the chocolate(a little too rich for both of us), and our friends had the other flavors, can't even remember them all, but they even had the salted caramel - which was by far the best of the bunch.  I was recently introduced to the whole salty/sweet combo thing, and I have to say, it tastes A LOT better than it sounds(read: choc covered bacon).  But most of the flavors were very good, save the chocolate one...oh yah, sampled the balsamic strawberry - it tasted more like real strawberries since they weren't as sweet.  Not too expensive tho, so a great place for dessert if you're in the area.  Oh yeah, there was ONE flavor I didn't like too much in addition to the choc(I had to read another review to remind me)...the Honey Lavender; it tasted like I was eating flowers...albeit cold ones.   Parking - we took the Bart and walked, but parking looks like a major beyotch in this area Service - Very nice and friendly, and they help move the line along w/o much trouble.   I would definitely come again.

Delicious goodness is what this place is! I've heard a lot of great things about Bi-Rite and finally my sister, daughter, nephew and I made a trip over here yesterday. Good thing too cause it was 97 degrees out, yup no typo there it was 97 degrees in San Francisco. After getting a scoop each of the Salted Caramel, White Chocolate with blackberries and cookies and cream, I was in ice cream heaven. My 21-month old daughter did however help me with my three scoops and she loved it. Her sweet tooth is worst than mine so I decided to take home a pint each of the Salted Caramel and white chocolate with blackberries. On the way home, I didn't feel so guilty about missing Bikram cause it was worth the trip and many more to come(",) Oh and I did get a taste of the Balsamic Strawberry, I'll be taking a pint home the next time I'm there. I can't wait to go home and eat some Bi-Rite ice cream. Another plus is that they use organic products and that there are no artificial flavoring.

Can't believe that after living in the City for over 20 years and passing by many times before, we finally came here for first time tonight for what everyone has been raving all about: salted caramel ice cream! It was very flavorful and tasty along with the Honey Lavender I had in my single cup! My friend had the balsamic strawberry along with the white chocolate blueberry or raspberry swirl. It was not overly sweet or rich, but satisfying for my sweet tooth. The wait outside was about 20 minutes around the corner on this nice Labor Day holiday even at 9pm. Looking forward to coming back and trying the other flavors!

because it's even mentioned in the same sentence as Mitchell's, that should be enough to get you to try Bi-Rite.  like the other small independent ice cream shops scattered in SF, parking is tough and you will have to fall in line but dont let that deter you - the ice cream is that damn good.  i had the balsamic strawberry and the lavender ice cream - out of this world!! the flavors really worked and they were very pronounced - you could taste actual strawberries and lavender in every lick/bite/suck.   i love mitchell's and i love bi-rite - it's a tie for me!

They only offer two flavors of vegan ice cream but for non-dairy people like me, that's already more than enough =) I always go for the vegan chocolate coconut and it never disappoints. Great flavor and you can't even tell that's it non-dairy. Their waffle cones are non-dairy too which is a definite plus. There's always a line here after dinner but don't let the line intimidate you because the line moves quickly so the wait is usually only 10 minutes or so. It's worth it!

Line was thankfully short and ordered the salted caramel. good taste, nice and salty with a hint of caramel. it was good, but not amazing. i think it melted too fast in my cone/cup so i didn't get to enjoy it that much. dont quite understand the hype. prices are reasonable, which is nice.

So we come to Sf to escape the heat of south Florida. Just our luck, we hit a heat wave. Not to worry, after walking around the Castro and Mission areas we were right near Bi-Rite.

The guy working there was very friendly and eager to help, even after working what I presumed to be a long day with dozens of customers. It's great to sit outside on the benches and enjoy some quality ice cream!

really fresh ice cream they have there no matter what time of the day it is, their ice cream is fresh and consistent. i'd have to say, their banana, coffee, and salted caramel flavors are the best they have. I really don't wanna compare them to other creameries, but its my favorite place since i've been there. oh PS goodluck finding parking!

My group went here for dessert after pizza at Delfina. I had the mint chip and was surprised the ice cream was laid out like gelato rather than the big tubs at more traditional ice cream shops. My flavor was delish and my group liked their ice cream too. I'd go here again if I'm in the neighborhood, but probably wouldn't make a special trip.

where do i even begin!?? i love everything about this place .. minus the parking that is. haha everything i've tried here is amazing. their ice creams are full of flavor! i never knew that ice cream could taste so good until i went here. everything is made with natural ingredients, which definitely makes a huge difference. coffee toffee is my favorite. i'm willing to make a road trip from sj just to buy a pint. *drool...* the coffee toffee sundae is pretty awesome as well. and yes, i admit .. i ate the whole sundae by myself. but it was worth it! salted caramel is also a must try! this seems to be the crowd favorite, which i can clearly taste why. balsamic strawberry is quite tasty as well. i was a little drawn back by the name, but trust me! it's really good. long story short, you gotta try this place!! you won't regret it. the staff is extremely friendly. the line tends to be a bit long, even on cold, late nights, but the quick service usually speeds up the wait.

Honey lavender ice cream for me please! This is one of the best lavender flavored treats I've ever had! The flavor is mild and pleasant. I tried the salted caramel which was a bit too thick and salty for me. I am a true fan ice cream. The weirder the flavor, the better. I am willing to wait in line for ice cream but there's a catch, ONLY at Bi-Rite! I once came on an early Saturday evening ('round 7pm) and there was NO line. It's like, it was meant to be-all the ice cream for me!

Bi-Rite does ice cream right. I tried the caramel salt, coffee toffee, toasted coconut, and the roasted banana which all had an explosion of flavor. I would say the caramel salt was my favorite and coffee toffee is not far behind as well.

I love ice cream, but considering it's not the most healthiest thing to eat, I try to refrain. Tried bi-rite ice cream bc of all the rav reviews and the verdict is: melt in your mouth awesomeness. I ordered the toasted banana and it was yummers. Taste exactly how it sounds....banana ish, toasted, and creamy. Tried my friends salted caramel and it is delicious. If I lived up north, bi rite would def be my go to place for ice cream.

This ice cream shop is awesome as its popularity indicates. They have many unique flavors like honey lavender, salted caramel, roasted banana, strawberry balsamic, and many many more. If you love ice cream, you should definitely check this place out. BUT!!!, if you choose the wrong day and time, you'll find yourself waiting in over 30 minutes in line just for an ice cream. Since parking is not easy around this area, if you have spent enough time finding parking and end up waiting, you'll be spending an hour for an ice cream. The pleasure you get out of this ice cream is immense, but it only lasts 5 minutes tops. I have spent an hour here many times only to see my happiness come to an end in 5 minutes. So, I suggest a few things to you guys. Try to avoid Saturday and Sunday lunch times as they are almost always packed during these hours. AND if the weather is sunny and great, forget about it. Try to avoid the lunch time and go between 3-5pm, when it gets less crowded. There is a park nearby, so on weekends and sunny days, everyone in the city comes out. Enjoy your ice cream, but avoid wasting your precious time.

You know ice cream is good when you're NOT an ice cream lover, and yet you crave this stuff even in January.  I made my sister bring me here twice on this visit, and both times I got the salted caramel (blew my effing MIND) and the brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl (also rockin').  So so so so good.  Thank goodness I don't live remotely close to this place, or I would be 300 pounds.

One of the biggest things for me at this place are the size options. I love me some creamy ice cream especially when It comes in smaller sizes. I don't care how good it is, if your medium is like a gallon, I can't handle it. The flavors are simple and delicious. honey- lavender, chocolate- coconut and banana all completely delightful.

As much as I enjoy ice cream, I can rarely finish a single scoop on my own. So when I happily licked up the last spoonful of my 2 scoops from Bi-Rite, I understood exactly why the lines are always out the door and down the street for this place. The line actually moves pretty quickly, and though I started on the corner of Dolores & 18th, I had the ice cream in my hands in less than 10 minutes. I'd remembered reviews raving about the honey lavender, so I asked to taste this and their famous salted caramel and liked both so much that I went with a scoop of each, even though I got into the line intending to get just one. 2 or 3 blocks later and halfway through my ice cream, though, I realized that I'd been given coffee toffee instead of salted caramel! Still good, but of course I was disappointed! Will definitely be back for that scoop :)

now i know why this place has 3000+ reviews. this is definitely as good as yelpers have hyped it up!! after having tried so many good ice cream places all over new york, berkeley, bay area, this place definitely trumps everywhere. the ice cream is so creamy and the flavors definitely hit the spot. the line was super long even when it's 30 minute before closing, so expect to wait for a while. I tried the salted caramel, which is the recommended and it was amazing!! the coffee toffee was equally as good. i definitely wish i can try others. i think overall, all of the flavors are really good, so whatever you get, you won't be disappointed. they also sell in pints and quarts if you would like to have more!

Bottom Line - Though the ice cream here doesn't compare to Graeter's... you can't get Graeters on the west coast, so this is about as good as it gets (5 stars).  I come back again and again for two flavours: salted caramel and brown sugar.  Yumm!!!

Best ice cream in San Francisco! I first got introduced to this place the beginning of this year and boy was it amazing. The workers here are so nice and friendly! Being a first timer, I wanted to try basically everything and at first I felt like I was getting pretty annoying, but they were super nice about it and even encouraging that I try more. The flavors were seriously out of the ordinary. And as for the wait in line, it's pretty moderate. It gets crowded some days, but for the most part, it moves pretty quickly. So if you're ever in the neighborhood, I definitely recommend you to head over to BiRite to get yourself a scoop of ice cream or two!

Bi-Rite never disappoints me :) And I don't care that it takes me years to find parking whenever I go there! All that searching is completely worth it in the end. My favorites are salted caramel, coffee toffee, and balsamic strawberry. Btw their cookies are delicious too so don't forget to buy some of those to dunk into your ice cream.

We spotted the take-out window first, and assumed that was all they made. Like hungry beasts, we quickly purchased the salted caramel soft serve (wouldn't you?).  We were disappointed that it was sickeningly sweet but not at all salty enough. As we ventured down the street, we discovered that they made regular ice cream as well, and after having a sample of that version of salted caramel, found it to be much saltier, but our insulin levels had already maxed out for the day :( So if salted caramel is what you seek, be patient and walk ten steps down to the actual storefront!

This place is great!  Hubs and I each got three flavors and had the roasted banana, malted vanilla with peanut brittle, brown sugar w/ginger caramel, honey lavender, salted caramel x 2.  All flavors were excellent but I was disappointed that they didn't have the balsamic strawberry that day.  The ice cream is very creamy and rich.  We loved every bite!

This is the best ice cream I have ever had, worth eating despite the freezing cold wind. I had the roasted banana, perfect and not fake tasting at all, and the vanilla malt which had yummy crunchy chocolate things in it. My mom had the salted caramel, again delicious, and the prailine. I loved the metal tasting spoons and the guys behind the counter who were absolutely hilarious. This is definitely a must see whenever in San Francisco, just be careful about walking around some of the streets around Mission.

Best ice cream in the city. I tend to like flavors without a lot of add-ins, and  this is perfect because like the name says it's creamy. And it's just plain good. The lines are sometimes atrocious. I would't wait in a line more than 4 people for it, because you can just go and buy a pint down the street.

i feel like an idiot because it took me sooo long to actually go to bi-rite, i blame it on the ridiculously long line that's perpetually formed out the door. So it makes sense that i finally went in on a whim, when, as i was walking by, I saw that there were only FOUR people in line! I found out that that was because they were just past closing, but i pouted my lips and the sweet, sweet doorman let me in to convert me to their sweet sweet ice cream cult of deliciousness. i got cinnamon ice cream with pieces of snickerdoodle, an ice cream combination i often search for but rarely (more like, never) find. the name escapes me because it was so good. I digress, think about it, where else would there be a line to eat ice cream in the middle of a cold night in january? That line speaks for itself, and I am now happy to be a part of it (but, thankfully, their service is fast so it moves quickly). enjoy!

i love bi-rite ice cream. the lines don't feel too long... i like the quality better than mitchell's actually. everything tastes great, ricanela, mint chip, salted caramel, yums yums... i had a banana split yesterday though with a ricanela scoop, and my HEAD EXPLODED WITH JOY. ricanela is already wonderful: snickerdoodle in cinnamon ice cream. but then this was drizzled with fudge, and had half bananas on either side which were BRULEED! there was a smattering of walnuts and the whipped cream was SALTED. this is by far the best banana split of my life. you can't imagine my face when i first tasted it. i don't want to get too detailed, but basically imagine the ecstasy of st. teresa by bernini, and there you have it. my friends were backing away from me as i arched my back and howled while clutching the spoon to my bosom. need to try this honey lavender with hot fudge. i shy away from lavender in sweet things because i feel a little bit like i'm eating bed linens... but bi-rite can probably pull it off.

Getting ice cream at Bi-Rite is like waiting in line to get into a club, but it's well worth it. I have never tasted the types of ice cream concoctions anywhere else.When you get to the front, they let you sample all the flavors you want without feeling rushed.  The Salted Caramel and balsamic strawberry is eye roiling in the back of your head good. And if they run out of scoops of salted caramel, you can buy a pint. The ice cream melts quickly so you'll need to make it home fast or find the nearest freezer you can store it at.

WOW!! Screw polly ann's and Mitchell's. This place is the SHIT. I've never had ice cream as good as this. Their ice cream are homemade, not too sweet, and texture is perfect to taste. Creamy yet firm. A friend told me about this place and after a week of talking about it, he finally took me. It was a tuesday afternoon so it wasn't crowded at all. I tried their honey lavender ice cream and it blew me away. I felt like I was literally eating flowers. The fragrance of the lavender was so accurate but not overwhelming. It was too perfect! Went back again a week later with a different friend, this time it was on a weekend and damn it was crowded. The line went around the corner of the block. It was worth it!! They have some crazy flavors. Salted caramel (popular flavor), Roasted  Banana, Toffee Coffee, Ginger (yes, ginger! Not a fan of ginger but it was good!), Balsamic Strawberry, and much more! A must go. Bi-rite ice cream will not disappoint your taste buds.

Guilty pleasure number one after shoes and an addiction to clothes is gelato or gelato resembling products (um..that'd be ice cream). And there's one flava flav that I love: Rum Raisin. Which is why I can't give BR Creamery a fifth shurikin. That aside, it's freakin' heaven. Mitchells was my "go-to", but after sampling the Honey Lavender, Salted Carmel, Coffee Toffee and Chocolate...I have to reconsider. Actually, they're in two different leagues. Bi-Rite Creamery is a gourmet stop for flavorful ice cream. Mitchell's is your mainstay. One drawback is that Bi-Rite doesn't have that many gelato flavors. They need to seriously expand their gelato selection. Otherwise, love in a cone.

With over 600 reviews I can safely say it's been said by now - but I really enjoyed my ice cream today! We tasted a bunch of options and I finally settled on the toasted coconut and the banana. Phenomenal. I like the whole idea of this place. It's super cute and they're super nice, giving us a trillion samples and splitting scoops, which a lot of places get annoyed about. And you know it's freshly made with quality ingredients. Happiness. We lucked out and didn't get stuck in a line, and could take our time working out the order. As good as I'd hoped!

Tried the Ricanelas (cinnamon  with snickerdoodles), Mint Chip, and Salted Caramel.  Ricanelas was ok. Mint Chip starts out tasting like any other mint chip ice cream, but it has a good refreshing kick at the end.   Salted Caramel is still my favorite.  Recommended!

Bi-Rite, so right.  On a perfect or not so perfect day in the city, there's nothing better than a scoop of their salted caramel ice cream.  You can see the line forming down the block as you're walking to the shop but let me guarantee you that the 15-20 minute wait is worth every minute.  My second and third favorite flavors are ginger and mint chip.

The salted caramel has seriously changed my life. Tastes exactly like the burnt caramelized sugar of a perfect creme brulee.

I love ice cream so I was looking forward to trying this place for the first time.  The parking is terrible in this neighborhood so I had someone drop me off to pick up the goods.  I went at about 7:45pm on a Thursday night and there was no line.  I chose 3 pints to take home.   Salted caramel:  I've heard so many good things about this flavor and I happen to love caramel.  I thought it was fantastic!  There's just something about the salty sweetness.  I felt the consistency was on the thin side and melted a bit too quickly.  It also had a strong aftertaste, in a good way.  Overall, this flavor was terrific!   Brown butter pecan.  The flavor wasn't very rich and it had bits of pecan in it.  It was good, but I've had better versions.   Roasted banana.  This one was great!  It had a strong natural banana flavor and the consistency of this one was thicker than the salted caramel.   I felt like all three were on the airy/fluffy side.  Maybe that's just the way they make their ice cream.  It's not like the thick, dense stuff, more like the slow/double churned Dryers ice cream consistency.  I guess I was expecting something heavier.  It's not cheap either - pints was $7.99 each, which is pretty expensive for ice cream.  But I would go back only for the flavors I can't find elsewhere, like the salted caramel.

Salted caramel ice cream from Bi-Rite Creamery is a dangerous addiction.  I've risked parking tickets, and swerved between homeless and hipsters just to get my mitts on a bowl full of that treat.  I have a second stomach that extends just for occasions such as these, always happy to find a little more room for just one more spoonful.

A local landmark, since it was featured in Out Magazine.  I tried the place a few times, and were impressed by the quality of the ice cream each time.  Creative flavors, honest, wholesome incredients and the busy location are all pluses.  However, the signature line-around-the-block can be a bit annoying, and the difficult parking situation makes it a once-in-a-while place.  I guess I simply don't crave the ice cream enough to want to put up with the parking or the wait.

The ice cream was pretty good.  I got the olive oil flavor but I couldn't really taste the olive oil.  I also had some of the salted caramel which was very strong and flavorful. The staff was really nice and I felt comfortable. The only major drawback is the line.  I was there on a fairly cool night, not a typical ice cream kind of night, and the line was still pretty long.  I couldn't imagine trying to get some during a warm sunny day.  I don't think I would even try.

ohhgguh. my tummy aches. i ate 1/2 pint of salted caramel in about 10 minutes. so salty! so caramelly! though i don't necessarily mind what my body does after mass quantities of dairy, the people around me might have something to say about it. let's hope the torture waits till tomorrow to rear its nasty head. i envision the following, in my ice-cream induced fantasy: a 1950's style diner, with tall vinyl booths, a jukebox at every table, a long bar like the one at st francis soda fountain, and a rotating cake display. waitresses like my lady katie joy-- a little bit of attitude, a drizzling of sweetness, and the efficiency of a stockbroker--serving not diner food, and not even blue plate-style gourmet diner food, but tartine pastries, quiches, and sandwiches, as well as hot, fresh versions of what sits behind the birite market deli counter, and all the ice cream treats offered at birite creamery. this town has plenty of comfort food, but one thing that birite market, birite creamery, and tartine all have in common is their delicious products without enough places to sit. hence, the diner. designed for people to stay a while. what about in that old fabuloid/wang fat fish market spot on mission and 18? or where that new Stack's is going in, on hayes and octavia? or, right across the street from that--the old oxenrose has been sitting empty for the last 15 months. whaddya say?

Of course the parking is going to be horrible and there are huge lines on the nice weekends in SF when people are filling up dolores park.  We stopped by here at night to find a small line.  the Roasted Banana was good, although a bit too much of a banana liqueur hint to it.  chocolate was decent, maybe a bit dry...and for all their interesting combinations, no milkshakes?  Nope.  no milkshakes.  Booo-urns.

The ice cream looks really nice in the freezer. You can sample all of the available flavours. Last night was the first time that I tried the ice cream. And yes, it was creamy. I had the Salted Caramel. I had 2 scoops, in a cup. There is a freezer on the left which has the pre packaged pints of ice cream that you can buy and take home. Also on the left is a display of books and other things about food and desserts. There is no washroom for the public. We are taunted with the washroom door, but alas, it is for employee use only. The parking situation is a little cramped, but you should be able to find something. The parking police won't be trolling around for you. Anyway, even if it's cold outside, you should still give this a try.

I have never seen the line so long as yesterday, although I rarely see the sun shine here either.

ice cream - 3 stars soy ice cream - 5 stars you know. i wish the ice cream was AMAZING. it is great and interesting, BUT SOY- cream is awesome - especially the chocolate soy, and the cookie crumbles for the topping is wonderful. when you can have milky ice cream because of the belly, soy makes you smile. you can also get ice cream sandwiches and pints (BUT VERY EXPENSIVE) - and mountainous sundaes but i gotta say that despite some of the deliciousness, MITCHELL's on san jose ave (near mission and 29th street) is the BEST ice cream. oldie but goodie. great sorbets, chocolate peanut butter icecream, grasshopper, sundaes, I'M IN LOVE!

Bi Rite Creamery you make me fat but your ice cream is so decadent that I'd rather be fat than live without you.  I enjoy all the flavors but particularly the salted caramel and pumpkin.   Just one scoop for me because I'm just not willing to shell out $7 for a pint of ice cream.  I love that the flavors of the ice cream change according to the availability of local and seasonal products.  Bi Rite can do no wrong!

Mmm.. If you love dark chocolate, or if you're just PMSing, you've got to try the Soy Chocolate. It's the darkest chocolate ice cream I've eaten. Bi-Rite's flavors are unique, but the selection is small. There are probably about 10 flavors total, though all of them sound very exotic. Other than Soy Chocolate, I also sampled Lavender, which was a little too odd and a little too sweet. The cashier (maybe he was the manager?) seemed a little nutty when I was there, but I mean that in the best way possible.

Yes, it's expensive. True, the lines get long (but they move fast). Bottom line, though, it's the best ice cream in the city with the most creative list of flavors -- coffee toffee, honey lavender, burnt caramel, balsamic strawberry -- and it's located in the heart of a vibrant San Francisco neighborhood. Grab a cone, head to Dolores Park and let your worries subside with each lick!

i was intro-ed to bi-rite last year when a friend was visiting and did i fall in love with this place! the friend of the friend told us that they had salted caramel, honey lavender and other flavors that they make and we were both intrigued i got the honey lavender and even tho it sounds weird to be eating something lavender flavored, it tastes exactly how it smells, but even better w/the honey in it...my friend got the salted caramel and it was an interesting flavor but had the balance of the sweet/saltiness that i like i took my bf there earlier this year and he got the snickerdoodle concoction and he loved it...i sampled a little and wished i should've gotten that instead b/c it tasted just like my favorite cookie! every time i've gone, the line is always long, but its worth the wait to satisfy my bi-rite cravings!

This place has really different flavors of ice cream so it is a nice change from the "usual".  A sundae was $6.50 which seemed pricey to me because it wasn't that much ice cream. I didn't think it was as great as my friends told me it was so maybe my expectations were too high?

Bi-Rite really doesn't need another 5 star review but here it is anyway, more to boost my own review count than anything else! It took some convincing to get my brothers to come all the way out here with me, especially since the younger one was craving some Mitchell's mango and they were NOT intrigued by the salted caramel flavor. Once they saw the line out the door on a freezing and windy SF summer night, they were convinced that this place "had to be good". We lucked out with gangsta parking and discussed our flavor choices while we waited in line. I went with salted caramel and ricanelas (snickerdoodle), the bros tried combos of the basalmic strawberry, roasted banana and ricanelas. After tasting my cone I decided that there is too much hype over the salted caramel. Don't get me wrong, it was super tasty but man, that snickerdoodle flavor was like SOO much better! Why isn't there more hype about the snickerdoodle? It's expensive, but luckily I only get cravings for ice cream every once in a while. I'm looking forward to picking up a cone on a sunny weekend and taking it across the street to Dolores Park to soak up some sun.

the honey lavender ice cream reminded me of eating weeds.  yes, i've eaten weeds, and it tasted like this flavor. i couldn't really taste the ginger in the brown sugar with ginger, but i really liked it nonetheless. the chocolate was way rich.  rich like you're actually eating a block of chocolate in each spoonful.  i can see some people liking that.  it made me went back for more weeds.

Excellent ice cream shop. Tried the Salted Caramel. It was good and it's probably just me, but it was too salty for me. The Balsamic Strawberry was awesome. Not too impressed with the sugar cone they used but whatever. The people are laid back and let you try whatever you want. And they're not cheap with their samples either. Plus, Dolores Park is right outside. All good qualities for any ice cream parlor.

Returned to Bi-Rite and tried Sam's Sundae, which consists of chocolate ice cream, whipped cream, bergamot olive oil and sea salt.  While the chocolate ice cream was really tasty, the sea salt was totally overwhelming.  Usually the salt v. sweet flavor combination works well, but in this case, the sea salt was a bit too much.

It makes me sad that I did not become aware of the existence of Bi-Rite until a conversation with a friend of mine in December who lived in San Francisco for a few years.  I don't know how long they've been open, but I would have been a regular here for decades had I known of its existence (and be about 20 pounds heavier). I stopped by here for good solid ice cream in a somewhat cramped space at the end of 18th and Dolores after stopping by Tartine Bakery for a requisite bread pick-up stop.  Yes, it's too cold for ice cream, but I needed to try this and I was glad that I did.  The honey lavendar ice cream is lovely, you can taste both the honey and the lavendar and neither overwhelms the other (which is what happens frequently with attempts at mixing honey and lavendar in ice cream or other desserts, as they are two flavor profiles that I love together and separately).  I tasted the Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl and loved it and should have gotten this in my small cup of ice cream, but instead I got the Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces, which I found disappointing.  The peanut brittle overwhelms the malted vanilla and creates for a bitter taste that I didn't like at all.  I should have gotten the brown sugar instead. I was glad that the line was on the short side and moves rather quickly, unlike the line at Tartine Bakery.  You know I am a New Yorker when I think that two scopes of ice cream for $3.95 is not too bad for a creamery that makes its own ice cream using fresh ingredients (or in the corporate lingo "in a responsible and sustainable manner").  I enjoyed sampling ice cream on actual metal spoons rather than the plastic ones that you get from most gelato/ice cream places.  I just wished that they had more seating, as I didn't really care for sitting outside the store on the benches that surrounded the trees on the street, but I was happy to sit and was glad that the seats were rather clean.  Thank you Ned for the suggestion, I will go into my sugar coma now.

this little ice cream store opened with a line wrapped around it and it's been that way ever since. yes, it is that good. sometimes i need a break from bi-rite, but that's because i live 2 blocks away and ice cream as dinner can become a too good ritual. a lot of peeps love the salted caramel, i did not enjoy it at all. my staple favs are roasted banana and honey lavender. right now, i'm loving the malted vanilla with peanut butter brittle and brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl. my friend got me an ice cream cake here recently, it was the smores cake - chocolate cake with a layer of marshmallows. it was SOOOO delicious. things to love: - free tastings of all the yumminess - sorbets, popsicles and vegan ice cream for the non-dairy fans - homemade whipped cream, just divine - vegan sprinkles - ice cream sandwiches!!! my fav is the strawberry with sugar snap cookies - caramelized bananas from the sundaes - cones are really tasty, no card board taste here! - biodegradable spoons & cups - loyalty card because when you go this much, a free cone is really a sweet thang...

salted caramel, orange cardamom, and earl grey are heavenly sent flavours coming out of this little creamery.  Line pours out of this door till late hours but if you just want to get a pint you can bypass the line and head straight to the cash box.  The icecream doesnt seem to bother my lactose intolerance (hehehe) so i give it a star for that. Fenton's is still my favorite and its a bit comparable to Ici's at Berkeley...Its easy to get to and a perfect spot after dinner in the city makes this spot a must visit for any weary traveler. 4/5 judochops.

It was a sunny day.  We drove by, saw the line, but still looked for parking.  I had been wanting to try their ice cream out, but am rarely in the neighborhood.  We waited in line for about 15 minutes, which gave me enough time to decide on my two flavors.  I picked Salted Caramel and Honey Lavender.  Yes, the scoops are small, but that was okay by me.  Sometimes you just gotta pay the price for something better.  The Salted Caramel was beyond belief.  The ice cream itself is so creamy and smooth.  The flavor was simply amazing.  To be honest, I don't remember much about the Honey Lavender.  It tasted like it should and was good, but not my favorite.  I guess it would work for someone who really likes those two together.  Fortunately for us, there was seating inside, along the side with the windows.  It was a busy day and folks were sitting on benches outside, too.  The line does move fast, so for the indecisive folks, make sure to get your flavors down by the time you get to the front of the line.   I have a fellow sweet tooth friend whom I'm trying to convince needs to try the Salted Caramel out, because I know he would fall madly and deeply in love with it.  He is grossed out though, by the thought of salt and caramel together.  In his mind, that combo doesn't work.  HELLO???  What about salted caramel chocolates?  I guess he's never had those before.  Anyway, wouldn't you know it?  A friend gave me an entire pint of the Salted Caramel a few weeks later for doing her a favor.  Believe it or not, I managed to make it last for over a week in my freezer.  About every other day, I would take it out, scoop out little, and just savor the salty sweetness.  I hate to say it, but OMG!  I  would pretty much try and lick the bowl clean each time.   Well, I guess that's why you get a pint, so you can get away with behavior like this in the privacy of your own home.  If I go back, I'll try out the other flavors, but it will have to be paired with a scoop of the Salted Caramel. Whatever they do and however they're doing it, I hope Bi-Rite Creamery continues to do it.  And don't ever discontinue the Salted Caramel!

Bi-Rite is... good.  Really good.  It just isn't to die for, amazing, unbelievable like it would have to be to deserve the hype it gets and its 2000+ reviews.  It reminds me of Pinks in LA... it would have to be *astonishing* to stand in that line, and it's not.  It's also not cheap.  The flavors are nice, but unusual ice cream flavors are more common these days, so once again the line is quite a disincentive.  Some of the flavors actually strike me as a little heavy-handed, like the brown butter pecan... it's just a little too much.  Anyway, if you are one of the few members of the species who haven't tried it yet, you should... maybe if you go at an off time on a really icy day you won't have to stand in line that long.  Then again, maybe you will.

do you want a perfect day in sf with your girls? well then follow this plan! 1. brunch at lime with bottomless mimosas and straight up club scene complete with top 40 hits, booty shaking, and eye candy. oh yeah and pure drunkenness. don't forget to talk boys, sex, and what you did the night before at the club. 2. once you're too tipsy to drive, walk over to bi-rite and have each girl order a different flavor (you can't go wrong with salted caramel, strawberry balsamic, earl gray, damn the list goes on). 3. take your ice cream across the street to dolores park and just hang out and enjoy the sun and each others company! and take plenty of pictures, especially with the ice cream! 4. on your walk back (or if you're super lazy taxi back) to your car in front of lime, stop by ikes and grab a menage a tois (but call ahead to avoid the wait in line!) if you're really feeling like a fat a$$! and hey aint nothing wrong with that! i love me food and food loves me right back.

Rikanelas: (cinnamon ice cream with real snickerdoodle pieces) ********** Coffee Toffee: (coffee ice cream with toffee bits) **** Salted Caramel: (too sweet for my taste...) *** Price: decent, kinda on the pricey side compared to other places... would i go again?? Hell yes!!!! just for more Coffee Toffee and Rikanelas. :)

What? NO LINE??? I wasn't sure I was in the right place...just so happened I was in the right place at the right TIME :) We went late afternoon and only had a couple people ahead of us, allowing plenty of time to make up our minds which flavors we wanted. Five stars for patiently letting us try as many as we wanted. Had to try the Honey Lavendar, as interesting as it was, I decided on Brown Butter Pecan and Salted Carmel. Both were delicious. The ice cream is soo creamy and I love the bio-degradable bowls and wood spoons. Very friendly service.

Pasted by here on my way to Tartine and it looked pretty busy. So I decided to put it on my "to try" list. I ended up trying this place toward the later part of the evening. Finishing dinner with a girl, and wanted to have some desert...we decided this would be a good bet. We decided to swing by here grab a pint and head up to twin peaks. Vanilla Malt was the choice...and I have to say it was pretty damn good. If your near by, it's a great way to end the night.

I have a new favorite friend in SF, the man who works behind the counter at bi-rite creamery. how could you not be full of sunshine working here? he provided me with a bounty of samples, even a few of his special creations, the chocolate ice cream with caramel sauce and sea salt hit the spot for me. yum, yum,yum.  I am going to try and recreate this at home since, sadly, I live a plane ride away from my bi-rite. I still went my fav, chocolate ice cream and salted caramel ice cream on a cone, always a special treat when I am visiting the bay area.

Ever since I discovered this place, thanks to my co-worker, I love it! Despite the long lines and limited parking spaces, it never deter us from stopping by this place to grab a treat when we are in the area. Salted caramel is a must try. But after a while, I don't get the same satisfaction I got when I first had it, so I moved on to trying other flavors.  The malted vanilla with peanut brittle is now my favorite.  I'm not too adventurous and like to stick with ones I already know taste good. So it'll probably be a while before I will try another flavor.  Especially when there is a long time, I feel obliged to make a quick decision instead of spending time trying different flavors. Recently, I've noticed that your scoop size varies depending on the server you get. Some will give you an oversized scoop, which definitely worth my money, yet there are other times you get just barely a full scoop..otherwise, I still love this place! :)

I am a big fan of Bi-Rite, but I'm not a big fan of their line. The wait isn't really because of anything they do wrong, in fact it's more because of what they get right. They always have a ton of very interesting flavors and they will let you try each of them, which is awesome, but that makes for one very long and slow line. Honestly, just forget about it if you've got a hankering on a warm Saturday afternoon. I highly recommend the Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and the Ricanelas. A helpful tip: if the line is too long, just go to their grocery store down the street and split a pint of your favorite flavor (or eat it yourself, which is totally not sad).

After seeing Bi-Rite featured on Food Network's "The best thing I ever ate: Sugar Rush" and voted for one of the best ice cream places in San Francisco.. I had to come!!! I also had to try Sam's sundae: 2 scoop of chocolate ice cream drizzled in organic bergamot olive oil and maldon sea salt w/ side of homemade whipped cream  which was pretty good, they didn't drizzle enough olive oil but overall 5/5. (featured on food network) My friend got the coffee sundae:coffee toffee ice cream, almond toffee, hot fudge topped w/ homemade whipped cream and marcona almonds  and he said he loved it! that's if you're into the coffee feeling.  5/5 The line is reallly long depending how far you are, for us was about a 20 min waits.. 2/5 but its worth the wait trust me

From the moment you walk in and get a whiff of the warm baked goods, you know you've arrived to a special place.  I tasted a few of the ice cream flavors, and they were all super delicious.  The salted caramel was especially tasty, but I opted for my favorite - the coffee toffee.  You can't go wrong with coffee ice cream, and the toffee they use is soft and small enough to lick properly.  Yum!  Knowing this place rocks so much can be a bad thing since I bring my dog to Dolores Park almost every day.  Oh well, I'll just exercise more.

I almost couldn't finish it (gas--oink--p), well because a few minutes ago I scarfed down some girl scout cookies (I am the epitome of a pig.)

I finally hit Bi-Rite on a beautiful warm day with some out-of-town friends, after filling our faces with Tartine goodies, and man, did I impress them! Bi-Rite is worth waiting in line for fifteen minutes or more; their flavors are incredibly imaginative and super-fresh, and I love: (1) that their ingredients are organic (2) their bowls/spoons are compostable, and (3) they let you split a single into two flavors! Perfect for indecisive freaks like me. I had the salted caramel (it's everything that people rave about, AND more!) and the roasted banana (so deliciously creamy!) Although I have a soft spot for Mitchell's, I have to say that I prefer Bi-Rite because I don't get that disgustingly full and gross feeling when I'm done with my ice cream.

I have to say though, I think my fave is the classic roasted banana. Salted caramel is truly an experience to behold, don't know how they got all that caramel up in that ice cream. Intense! I resisted this place at first because it seemed like one of those annoyingly trendy yuppiefied mission spots, you know. But I am happy to report that this place is for real, forever!

Believe the hype. The Blue Bottle of Ice Creameries!!! You will have to wait during peak hours, but unlike Mitchell's Bi-Rite is worth the wait! Everything you have heard about the Salted Caramel is absolutely correct! I have not experienced a similar feeling since my first taste of Polly Ann Green Tea ice cream. I also loved the Ginger ice cream. Sooo strong, even for my jaded tongue. The sundaes feature delicious whip cream and a great assortment of nuts, which I am sure considering the aura of this place probably were grown organically with no harm to the surrounding soil, and great care taken not to bruise the nuts...ouch!...but I digress. I loved the blueberry compote topping. Very fresh and more fruit than jam, which is a plus, except that the topping really drowned out the flavor of the ice cream, surprising considering how strong the ice cream is. I recommend a simple double or triple cone to get the best flavor experience.

three words: olive oil sundae. somehow, they've managed to subvert the dominant paradigm of an ice cream shop, all while producing some of the best ice cream i've had.  you need to be brave here, but the payoff is huge. after hearing so many good things about this place, i was a bit surprised that their ice cream wasn't the creamiest ice cream i've had.  people usually flock to places that use lots of butterfat, but i don't think (though i could be wrong) that bi-rite follows this trend.  nonetheless, their ice cream is absolutely satisfying, and rocks your tastebuds with every bite. oh, did i mention that they use straus organic milk/cream and   biodegradable bowls and flatware?  awesome, just awesome.  they even make some vegan ice creams. i'm so glad this place exists, and i'm so glad that i have had the pleasure of enjoying it this summer.  next time you are headed to dolores park, stop here on the way.

Bi-Rite is pure heaven on a cone. Perfect as an after dinner dessert, for a sunny afternoon, or just when you have an antsy craving for ice cream which means that it's just right for any time of day or weather. I am in love with the cinnamon flavor or the ritual coffee toffee (even though I'm not such a big fan of toffee). It goes down light since the ice cream is not heavy like gelato, which is another story entirely because I love gelato too. And as for the space or a line (godforbid! ha) well I don't really care because the whole experience is hedonistic anyway so just relax. And I also prefer to sit on the benches outside.

The consistency and texture of the ice cream was a bit different, which is fine, but my ice cream was practically half melted before I even took the first bite.

Bi-Rite Creamery absolutely lives up to its reputation! Their ice cream is super thick and creamy, and so many interesting flavor choices, wow. I intended to have a scoop of the chocolate, but the honey lavender was too good to resist. Be sure to take advantage of the free samples, the flavors are often not what you may expect, and they give you a huge spoonful. And if you just ate dinner, get the "single" scoop with two flavors, it's a lot of ice cream!

My first time came to this place, was introduced with their famous salty caramel ice cream which I thought was really good paired with their butter pecan, which was very good as well. My eyes were locked into the balsamic strawberry but instead, I ordered cookies and cream because my hubby loves the flavor. So, maybe next time. Something to look forward to. I ordered the medium size (3 scoops). The ice cream was really good and I came at the right time (around 7 pm) because as I was leaving, I saw long line behind me.

I got a double scoop with butter pecan and this snickerdoodle flavor. It had some fancy name, but there were HUNKS of snickerdoodle cookie inside the cream. That's brilliant. I want to eat here everyday and curl up in the vats of ice cream at night to snuggle.

I would have done better w/ the roasted banana, but I felt like chocolate that day.. is it me or does the Mex choc taste a bit pot flavored? They were the perfect level of creaminess. The only thing that sucks is the line. Next time, I'm bringing a cooler full of ice and buying ice cream from the market.

was so sad when i went to the market thinking ice cream was open til 11. then some ppl came walkin down the street so. naturally i holla, and said is that bi rite. and it was.   i got to try many on their silver spoons, which is better for the trees and the fish than other sample spoons. spoons are important. i ended up settling on creme fraiche and ginger, the creme fraiche was destroyed as i was paying for it and sampled a salted caramel. dont do that, bc then the creme fraiche just isnt sweet anymore. and the friendly guy behind the counter made me laugh : "have a good night, have a good weekend, have a good week" i think thats where he stopped. it was funny :D

Bi-Rite is already unique and delicious and satisfying; but, when you add in consuming it on a hot, sunny day in Delores Park, it can't  be beat.  Great flavors, nice, patient staff and just so tasty!

Stood in line going back and forth on whether to have salted caramel or blood orange sorbet...as I got closer to the counter I decided I would taste the salted caramel but get the sorbet.  After one lil spoon I ditched my plan and got the salted caramel.  It was unbelievably yummy!  Staff was totally helpful in suggesting flavor pairings.  Will have to go back when I'm less full to try some of the suggested combos.

Holy shenanigans!  This place puts ice cream on a whole other level. Mr. O got the Salted Caramel.  It was like a slap to the tongue!  Bursting with flavor, woke him up in an instant!  He literally said, "Whoa!" Sam's Sundae was heavenly - sweet and salty.  It's familiar and new at the same time.  I'm not a huge vanilla fan, but I couldn't pass up the Banana Split.  It packed some serious vanilla flavor at it's purest!  Those caramelized bananas were so crunchy and sweet.   When I'm feeling sad or stressed, I like to open my browser to http://www.biritecreamer… and just stare at the flavors, plan out my next visit.  It makes me happy again.  :)

yes, only 4.  It's not the best ice-cream I've had.  It is awesome, but seems a little chic- derivative.   What I'm saying is, any small-box gourmet food-stuff could be sold out of the same location.  My faves are salted caramel and honey/lavender (amazing)- and while they had great and sometimes interesting flavors, nothing was truly exotic.  Personally, I'm not really looking for truly exotic ice cream, but the place should differentiate itself.  I've had richer, more polished, mind-blowingly decadent ice cream.  If anyone's in Chicago, check out the Plush Horse

5 star ice cream.  Star retracted only because EVERY time I go there is a wait in a line down the block.  Despite the decent microclimate of Dolores Park it is often cold out.  Let's recap: I wait in the cold to EAT THIS ICE CREAM in the COLD.  It is that great.  The best ice cream in the Bay Area.

Obviously my review is superfluous. But I must weigh in. I finally tried the ice cream on a chilly Monday night and instantly fell in love. Salted caramel, cookies and cream and the coffee toffee flavors are scrumptious. The ice cream is creamy and intense in flavor. There are about 10 other flavors I am looking forward to trying next time.

I have been wanting to try this place for a very long time but there is always a long line. I finally got to have a taste of this must-try-creamery. The ice cream was yummy and they had a lot of unique flavors- however I went the safe route with vanilla and cookies-n-cream, both were good. I think my experience would have been more mind-blowing if I had branched out. If I make it back here I will go for the more exceptional flavors. If your in the area stop by for a scoop or two.

It was my first time here yesterday and I can't believe I've been missing out on this amazing ice-cream! I found it on Yelp and so I went and tried the top 3 flavors. The roasted banana ice-cream was the best! I can't believe there are people to can make ice-cream as good as this. After this, grocery store bought seems too ice-age and just....blah~ Parking sucks but if you go with a friend, one buys while one circles around the block.

Well, like  some other yelpers.... I also saw the food network show about the Sam's Sundae. While it sounded tasty I didn't really see how someone could be so in LOVE  with a sundae that had salt and olive oil on it. (no chocolate sauce, no cherry? I mean how could it really be that good) . Boy I was wrong. I mean I always knew that a little extra salt made things sweeter (I'm know for making double salted chocolate chip cookies that everyone likes) but there is really something about the olive oil that takes this sweet treat from great to WOW!!

Unlike Humphrey Slocomb a couple of blocks away you can pretty much rest assured that every flavor you try here will be great. The line out the door can be a bit ridiculous, so if you can try to go on a nice weekday afternoon, when you can take your time and really enjoy all the flavors they have to offer. The location is also perfect for sunny days as Delores Park is just across the street.

We were food-comatose in our hotel room, watching food network's dessert special. They featured "Sam's Sundae" - Chocolate ice cream with bergamot olive oil, maldon sea salt and whipped cream ..WTF, right?..we decided to hunt this place down and try some. We finally found this place  and there was a line going outside and around the corner. It's not too bad of a line, but you have to stick it out. My friend and I ordered Sam's Sundae and the only way to put it is "a party of flavors in you mouth". It was sooooo weird, like a really GOOD weird. I sampled their salted caramel and it was amazing! Their sundaes are a little pricey, but enough to share with someone and definitely worth it.

The line was around the corner! we got there at 10:22pm and barely made it into the store! when we got to the counter we understood what the wait was for.  I decided to try the coffee toffee and VEGAN chocolate coconut. As soon as the flavors caressed my tongue, I knew that I had to get both. A single gets you 2 flavors! Happiness ensued in my mouth and in my wallet. The toffee coffee is bold and the chocolate coconut is light and tasty, I couldnt believe it was vegan!!! Definitely have to go back. bring fun people to hang in line with and if you think you can't find the place. Just look for the ridiculously long line.

For the standard ice cream flavors, Mitchell's is probably your best bet.  But if you want some interesting, new, and innovative flavors/flavor combinations hit up Bi-Rite.  Salted caramel and roasted banana flavors are amazing and Sam's Sundae has been featured on Food Network.  Recommended but be prepared to wait on a warm weekend!

mmmmmmmm salted caramel............. enough said. At first bite when I sampled the salted caramel...I was thinkin' mmm maybe not. But I had to try their chocolate, and what goes best with chocolate then salted caramel! It's such a splendid idea for an ice cream, I ask why other brands dont sell it at the grocery store? Maybe because it wouldn't live up to how yummy the Bi-Rite flavor is. Be warned, that while it is 5.6 miles away from the SF bridge (so my yelp app told me) it's a rather far detour when trying to get back to the east bay. Worth it? Well, the 25min line was worth it, but I am not sure if I would make a big detour again. If we happen to be in those parts of the city then yes. The hubby had the Sam's Sundae and it was gross. The olive oil, really tastes like olive oil, and its not yummy. We recommend avoiding it, even if it was featured on Food Network...

I was introduced to this place by a friend, I was skeptical at first, because I am not a fan of waiting in line nor am I really interested in marble slab, ben and jerry's or baskin Robbin style of icecream.  This place took my breath away, they took the art of making ice cream to a different level, good examples of creative flavors are: beer ice cream and lavender ice cream.  Absolutely delicious, I will definitely grab another cone next time I am in SF!

To begin with, I don't really discriminate on ice cream flavors. So I really liked the honey lavendar. Often compared to laundry detergent or potpourri, the lavendar was fairly floral but it still tasted great with the sweet honey...sigh... yeah i still think about how creamy it is. Flavors don't really get this exciting in Orange County so I think it's important to realize and appreciate the different flavors bi-rite has to offer. Also to note, great service =) Crowded and small, but worth the wait. Luckily the night i went wasn't too bad either.

After trying Ici and Humphrey Slocombe, I am convinced Bi-Rite has the best ice cream in the bay area.  Salted Caramel is still ice cream perfection.  And Balsamic Strawberry is the best strawberry flavored ice cream in existence.  Paying $3+ for a single cup of ice cream is so worth it... this is a must try if you are ever in San Francisco.

Give me Bi-Rite, or death by chocolate!!! There is no better Rocky Road ice cream on this planet. More importantly, who else could make something as odd sounding as Salted Carmel taste so darn good!!! Bi-Rite Creamery is a life experience that must be tried by every person in and visiting our beautiful city of San Francisco.

Yes, the ice cream is really good here but they also have the best rainbow sprinkles in the world!  Sprinkles can often taste a bit waxy but the ones here are thin, crisp and sugary.  These sprinkles are actually imported from Germany and are gluten-free (not that that matters to me).  Also, they come in pastel colours so they look oh-so-pretty on your ice-cream~

I usually don't like to eat whip cream but it was light and balanced out the rest of the ice cream combination quite well. My friend bought three tubs of ice cream for me to try - toasted coconut, honey lavender, and mint chip....i hope it's delicious :)

One of my roomies took me here when I was craving a sundae. I was bummed they didn't have just straight-up strawberry ice cream, so I got some malted vanilla with peanut brittle in it. It was pretty good, but, I have to say that it was so sugary that it made me thirsty! My roommate got some crazy sundae which had olive oil and sea salt in it! I had a taste of it and it was actually pretty tasty.  If you are in the mood for completely crazy ice cream or want to try a twist on an old fav, give this place a try.

So I honetlsy doubt that one more review about this amazing delicious ice cream shop will do any world of difference. every single ice cream that I have had has been totally and completly amazing, my two favorites so far include the cinnamon sugar one (tastes like a snikerdoodle) and the salted caramel. The malted vanilla is also really nice as is the pumpkin. I have never once hit the long lines I have heard about so i feel glad about that, and if you want to spice up your ice cream try thr brownie sunday option it has toated pecans which are soooo sooo amazing!!

Above average ice cream outlet. They should have more of the flavors that can be stunning: strawberry, blueberry. The lavender honey was my favorite, and I tried orange cardamon, coffee toffee, salty caramel, earl grey tea. The salty caramel I found to be too sweet for my taste, but I can see how people rave about it. The honey lavender I had a second serving of along with a Boylan's cream soda.

So, once again, I had ice cream from Bi-Rite Creamery. This is the fourth time this break and third time this week; I know, what's become of the health-conscious-conscious, right? To be honest, I'd probably throw my health out the window for this place, almost, maybe. Even before arriving, I had a craving for their Sam's Sundae. However, when we were maybe a block and a half away, I realized that I've already had the same sundae for more times this week than I thought necessary. I thought, "maybe I should give Sam a break, he's probably sick of my pugly mug." I knew I wanted a sundae, but could not decide between the two that caught my eye: the brownie or the banana. Now, let me tell you something about myself: I used to find banana split sundaes disgusting, to the point of repulsion. Why, well, when you swiftly deliver that first spoonful of your average banana split onto your anxiously waiting taste buds, the copious amounts of canned whipped cream just overpowers the entire experience: you get an eight-to-two ratio of fat-filled air to anything else. I hated whipped cream and would immediately make a self-programmed u-turn every time it came within close proximity to my palette. The whipped cream served up by Bi-Rite, however, is nothing short of heavenly: a fresh, airy, almost guiltless quality in every bite. I have a feeling that if given the choice, I could eat that stuff with almost anything, sweet, even savory, haha. Anyway, back to the review. Since I was already intimately familiar with Bi-Rite's whipped, and realizing that the only thing that had steered me away from trying banana splits was the usual canned whip fare, I decided to give myself the option of trying Bi-Rite's banana split. But I couldn't decide between my love for brownies and the spirit of trying something new. So, why not ask which the server preferred? So I did, to my delight. She probably sympathized with me as she offered to give me a two-for-one special, halving each sundae flavor and combining them to form a dual-delight. And so, I had a banana split on top of their chocolate ice cream and the brownie sundae on top of a scoop of vanilla, per my choice. Awesome. My impatient taste buds probably made the wait seem longer than it was, but every single millisecond of waiting was worth it for what I was about to see and taste. The whole sundae was like a piece of art, golden caramelized bananas and brownie bits sitting over two generous scoops of ice cream, topped off with huge dollops of freshly whipped house cream and caramel/chocolate syrup zigzags accompanied by toasted walnuts and candied pecans. Damn, feast for not only my tummay, but my eyes as well! Talk about two-for-one. I first started with the brownie sundae: soft, crumbly, cocoa brownies over vanilla ice cream. I enjoyed the brownie bits, but wished that they were toasty or even warm to play off the coldness of the ice cream. I think I enjoyed the vanilla ice cream way more than the sundae for what it was. And then, on to the banana. To be honest, I was a bit skeptical when I dipped my spoon into the banana split portion, but as soon as I spooned that mass of bananasplit into my mouth, all skepticism was replaced by orgasmic delight. I could barely keep it in... my mouth. The slightly crisp layer of banana complimented the cold chocolate ice cream perfectly and the whipped made the whole experience that much more creamier and dreamier. The walnuts added a nice robust, toasty flavor to the mouthful, accentuating the texture of the single layer of candied banana with its own nutty crunch. And then you get this creamy banana aftertaste that dances around your mouth. Mmm, favorite. Nothing short of it. I've had ice cream from Bi-Rite two days back-to-back now and I'm still hooked. Will I ever tire of the incredibly innovative and exotic flavors they consistently churn out? Will I ever be able to escape the inescapable money drain that is Bi-Rite Creamery?! I don't think so; at least not when they have such an inviting buy 10 get 1 free promo going on! So, in short: GET THE BANANA SUNDAE, or if you can't decide between two, ask them nicely to fit both into one bowl for you!

5 stars for flavor. Isn't that what really matters in ice cream?  Even on a freezing ass fall day in SF, the lavender honey is to die for. I woke up dreaming about it the other nite, which reminded me to write this review. The guys working there will encourage you to try anything too, which makes it super fun with all the delectable and sometimes unusual flavors. mmmmmm roasted banana caramel.

The salted caramel sounds kind of odd for an ice cream flavor, but one taste of this and you'll definitely want more. They are really nice about letting you try out all the flavors, so don't be scared to ask. I ended up getting the salted caramel, brown sugar and the coffee toffee. My boyfriend got the Brownie Sundae and that was equally as good. I loved the brownies and the candied pecans in the sundae. I have yet to try their baked goods, which is sold at the counter a couple houses down from the creamery.. but judging by the brownies in that sundae, I would recommend you get some of those cookies and brownies for the road :)

Bi-Rite is my new favorite ice cream parlor! I used to frequent Mitchell's but I am now a true believer of Bi-Rite and their salted caramel. The wait can be long though bearable (especially compared to Mitchell's) and parking can be near impossible. We usually park far and then walk to Bi-Rite which makes the ice cream even more enjoyable- kind of like a treat after a nice, long walk. I had been wanting to try this place for a long time and even tried a few times with no luck due to parking (or lack thereof). Needless to say, my expectations were increased due to the failed attempts but alas the salted caramel has me hooked.

Wait in line! I promise you wont regret it! With outrageous flavors like Ginger Caramel and Balsamic Strawberry this ice cream parlor attracts a huge crowd on all days of the week. The servings are small but the flavors rich and the sundaes offer unique toppings like berry compote and buttery soft toffee. Order a cone and stroll over to Delores Park on a hot day. Its a good experience and a great place to bring guests visiting from out of town who want to get a taste for the mission.

a small, pretty much organic ice cream shop with delightful flavors. the salted caramel is a popular choice but my favorite is the roasted banana. a single serving consists of 2 mini scoops and your choosing of 2 flavors! expect to wait in a line formed outside. it is worth the wait.

Salted Caramel is heavenly.  It's like the cone is good enough to wait in the line and the ice cream is just the bonus.

Either I've just been getting pretty damn lucky not having to stand in a huge line for all these places I've been dying to try or the food Gods have just been working in my favor. I'll take either :P After watching Toy Story 3 in 3D out in the East Bay, my cousin and I decided we wanted some ice cream. No, not just any regular ice cream, but Bi-Rite. We were sitting in the car contemplating whether or not we wanted to sit through that rush hour traffic, and the next thing you knew, we were on the freeway. Right as we were driving up the block to Bi-Rite, a car pulled out. As we were parking, I noticed that there was no line at all. Um, JACKPOT. The servers were so down to earth and not bitchy about giving you samples. I never understood how people who worked at ice cream parlors could be such douches.. who doesn't love ice cream? Anyway, I sampled the coffee toffee and roasted coconut and this is gonna sound ridiculous but I ended up getting their double, which allowed me to choose 2-3 flavors and I got the coffee toffee salted caramel, and malted vanilla with peanut brittle. The prices are definitely worth it, especially when you can opt for an organic sugar cone. I noticed that the different flavors had different consistencies. For example, the salted caramel melted the fastest while the coffee toffee took the longest to melt. That didn't mean they weren't all delicious because they were. As I was finishing my ice cream, I watched as almost every customer ordered the balsalmic strawberry. I decided to sample it... bad idea. I ended up ordering a scoop of it on my way out. Ok, I just put my fatass on blast but F it. That just shows everyone how bomb this joint is. But then again, who could ever say no to 4 scoops of ice cream?

Soft serve salted caramel & chocolate twist cone, side of rain.  For 15 mins I forgot it was raining. It was brain freeze delicious!!  As I licked around & around the two flavors began to blend together & it kept getting better.  Soft serve tends 2 melt quickly, but this just sat on my cone patiently waiting for me to polish it off.  I'd love more than anything to have that walk up window outside my door...lucky neighbors!

salted caramel...WH-WHAT????? we were up in the bay area for the sf half marathon..and well, we were trying to carbo load for the run. hahah ice cream counts too right?=P as a rookie to bi-rite creamery, we made the initial mistake of walking into the bi-rite market! upon walking to the end of the market you see pints of bi-rite ice cream in the freezer. umm, where's the ice cream man handing out ice cream cones????? haha, lucky for us dunces...the bi-rite staff strategically placed a sign on the freezer informing us that they have another location serving smaller portions of their ice cream across the street. D'OH! so off we go and there you see the creamery - a few shops down from the market across the street. there's 2 separate lines..one for the frozen yogurt (which you can do mix-ins with the yogurt or go get their flavor of the day) and also some baked goods. then right past that you'll see the longer line for the ICE CREAM! yum!! i applaud the bi-rite staff bc the line was moving fairly quickly. too quick that my mind was racing on what 2 flavors of ice cream to get! you can ask to sample the flavors so that helped out in the DECISION! haha. plus there was a small group of us and we each got 2 flavors so that we could try out as many flavors as possible=). so here's the scoop: Salted Caramel - hands down, one of my favs out of them all!  wish i lived closer so that i could bring a pint home with me! Honey Lavender - chose this over the Balsamic Strawberry to just offset the sweetness of the salted caramel. I liked it, quite refreshing and tastes like lavender tea. though my peers will argue with me that's it's too floral tasting..heheh to each their own. Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces - simple and sweet. so good. Balsamic Strawberry - don't let the name fool/scare you, flavor tastes like you're eating a fresh strawberry! Coffee Toffee & Chocolate - good on their own, but maybe too sweet to combine together? Toasted Coconut - a hit for all the coconut lovers! Roasted Banana - reminded me of eating a banana's foster=) the lady at the counter was super helpful and friendly sooo you know what that means...let's say the mantra together now: good service + good ice cream = thumbs up for bi-rite!!!

the salted caramel ice cream here? is the best ice cream EVER. seriously. (i am currently having cravings of that stuff) you really can't go wrong with any of the other flavors here (i've also enjoyed orange cardamom and honey lavender). but the salted caramel is amazing. and that long ass line? even when it's hella cold outside?  it's well worth it. seriously. i friggin love bi-rite.

I'm sorry Bi-Rite but I have to take away one star. Since you're in my neighborhood, I still frequent you, but I've tried other ice cream places (Humphrey's, Ici, Mr. & Mrs. Micellaneous) and I've been having second thoughts about five stars for Bi-Rite. It's mostly because I feel limited to salted caramel and a few other flavors when I go. I've decided that I'm not a big fan of the sorbets. They are vegan and there's a lot missing in terms of taste. Oh, but Bi-Rite's new addition, the soft serve is wonderful. If only they had more flavors everyday...

Quite possibly the richest and creamiest ice cream I've ever had in my life. Line was uncharacteristically long for a cold day but it went by pretty fast. Got the salted caramel and brown sugar (with ginger)--both were great but the salted caramel came out on top. Also sampled the balsamic strawberry, which was delish as well. Bi-Rite is definitely a must-try!!

I've only tried the salted caramel ice cream because we didn't want to wait in line. There were 4 ladies in our group and we finished the whole tub! The saltiness urges you to keep on savoring the ice cream. You might think that sweet and salty won't blend together but it was magic for the ice cream! The only reason we stopped eating was because we finished the tub! I would definitely go back to Bi-rite to try their other flavors!

Bi-Rite sits on the top of my list of favorite ice cream spots in the bay area!  Everyone raves about the Salted Caramel, but my favorite would have to be the Coffee Toffee.  The flavor of the coffee is on point and the toffee is made to perfection.  The toffee crumbles in your mouth instead of sticking to your teeth.  This place is not conducive to my goal of losing weight!

In this hot SF weather we are experiencing right now. The salted caramel and the Mexican Chocolate with Salted Peanuts are to die for. The downside are the long lines due to their popularity, but I simply go across the street at their grocery store. I grab a 1/2 pint or whatever size pint of either flavors or both.. w/o the stress of waiting in line.

Highly flavored ice cream that awakens all your tastebuds!  I tried the Salted Caramel and actually shared a scoop-  even that  was somewhat too much for me too handle!!  That particular flavor was kind of too strong at times, but awesome flavoring for ice cream.  If I venture out there again, I'd try a different flavor.

The salted caramel was a little strange for me but it was good.  I got a pint of the honey lavender also and it was just good for me at first.  But then I had another spoonful of the Honey Lavender and then another and sooner or later the whole damn pint was gone. Bi-Rite definitely got something going here with their operation.  They make some might good and different flavors of ice cream and I can see what the hype is all about for this place. I'm a fan!!

is it weird that i don't want my ice cream to taste like my earl grey tea? or that i don't want to taste what rose petals would be like converted into an ice cream? nor do i have any interest in tasting the honey lavender. maybe it's because i don't have a sophisticated palate. or maybe it's just because i don't feel like ice cream should be so complicated. so unnecessarily re vamped. to be honest, it freaks me out a little bit. but enough about the bad, let's talk yum. gotta love the ricanelas. cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodle cookie bits? yes please. banana ice cream with balsamic strawberry and chocolate? heck yes. love the cookies and cream as well. i will say i was feelin' swanky one night and decided to order a banana split, and after waiting almost a half hour in line, i ordered one thinking you couldn't pick yr own ice creams. i got my finished product and it was three scoops of just vanilla. HE DIDN'T EVEN ASK ME. I WAITED THAT LONG FOR A VANILLA SUNDAE. $6.50. screw that. thankfully i live relatively close so if i'm riding my bike by, i can see if they're line-less. if so, and the mood calls for it, sure i'll pick up some ice cream. if not, i'm headin' over to humphrey's. it's closer to home.. and my roommate works there. score.

Let the ice cream wars begin.....Bi-Rite/Humphrey Slocum/Mitchell's?? Bi-Rite has some really good scoops and is among the best in SF if not the best. Salted Carmel ice cream is my favorite there. There are so many amazing flavors to choose from though. The lines can be a little long on nice days, but totally worth it since you can take your amazing scoops out to Delores Park across the street to enjoy. If you are in the area this is an absolute must.

Gosh, how this place has grown! Still a Brown Butter Pecan girl for life, but another love has also entered my life. It's name is Soft Serve, available at the cute little window, just past the queue for the ice cream area. So far, have had the malted vanilla, chocolate, mexican chocolate, and salted caramel flavors. The texture is just perfect, and the intensity of the flavors really shines.

I am still riding the high of the endorphins released by my brain after coming here. Their ice cream is AMAZING- fresh, smooth, unique flavors. My last meal on earth could possibly be here. Personally I think it's better than Ici in Berkeley. I got the butter pecan and Earl grey and basically felt like I had died and gone to heaven.

Vegan coconut chocolate ice cream?! Good thing I don't live in the Mission or have a million dollars or else I would stop by every day. It's very good but since it's home made and everything, it can be a tad expensive for the little scoop you get. I think I rather buy a pint of soy ice cream at the market for $6 and put my own toppings on it and it can feed a few of my friends too.

The servers are friendly and extremely patient, especially when I ask to try almost every flavor they have. I also like that they have indoor and outdoor seating. My only complaint is that the ice cream is really soft and melts as soon as it leaves the refrigerated area.

Yum....still craving some ice cream right about now.  I have heard so much buzz about Bi-Rite and wanted to see if all this hype was fo' real!  I ordered the coffee toffee ice cream and instantly fell in love!  I love it when the coffee ice cream has a bitterness to it...and the toffee bits add just the right amount of sweetness.  I savored every bite!  Unfortunately, my plan of getting 1 scoop of coffee toffee and 1 scoop of the salted caramel was a failure.  The server accidentally ended up just scooping 2 scoops of the same flavor, so I wasn't able to get the full experience of Bi-Rite. :(  I was so excited to try the salted caramel, since that seems to be the one everyone raves about.  But I figured I can save that for my next trip up north.  Thank goodness my brother ordered a scoop of the salted caramel so I can get a taste of what everyone hypes about.  Oh my....it was DELICIOUS!  The best salted caramel!!!  Can't wait for my next visit to Bi-Rite....perhaps buy a gallon of salted caramel?  :) The line seemed a bit intimidating, but I didn't mind the wait....they help customers very efficiently here, which is a must with the size of this location.  I was so happy with the staff...they were all very friendly and helpful in explaining the flavors.     Like anywhere in the city, the parking situation is a PAIN...street parking only.  The parking gods were with us this day and we found parking in less than 15 minutes...what a record! I loved Bi-Rite, but I think Mitchell's is still top on my list....

What can I say that's different than the thousands of other reviews here? Well tried their famous salted caramel. It wasn't as salty as we thought and just kinda tasted like cracker jacks. Good thing in a small, they give you two tiny scoops and you can pick a different flavor to balance out the strongness of the salted caramel. I chose the honey lavender. As my friend said, it tasted like a "spa." Hahaha, thought about it and it's so true. The lavender was definitely the overwhelming taste in that flavor so it tasted like how a spa would smell. Both were good and I had one light flavor and one strong flavor so I think they balanced each other nicely. It was also a pretty cold day for the bay so no line. Whoohoo! They had the ropes set up outside but no need, just walked in and ordered. I will have to cpome back in the summer though when strawberries are in season to try their strawberry balsamic. $3.50 for a small. And there's maybe like 5 tables inside. All in all, cool and different flavors.

Delicious ice cream.  I like soft serve, so had their flavors of the day (they have two different flavors per day), salted caramel and chocolate.  LOVED the sundae, which was the ice cream with homemade hot fudge and marcona almonds.  Best sundae ever!  Went back again and had the almond toffee sundae, good, but a little too sweet for my taste.  There is always a line at this place...but the soft serve line is usually short and goes pretty quick.  Can't say the same for the other line.

Like someone wrote before me, this is more of 3.5 stars. I went with 3 instead of 4 primarily because this place might be overrated a little bit. I finally went there a couple weeks ago after wanting to go there for months. Long line around the corner, sunny and windy day. I got three different flavors and they were yummy. But as I was eating it I kept on thinking about how I don't necessarily need to drive to SF just to get this particular very good ice cream. If I'm nearby and want some good ice cream, I'd absolutely come here again. But will I drive there and deal with parking or Muni?? Ehhhh, not likely.

Anyone that serves Eggnog with Brandy ice cream is my new best friends and guess what?! Bi-Rite Creamery is my new best friend!!! My boyfriend had heard about this creamery on television, most likely on the Travel Channel, and has wanted to come here for a long time. So I decided to treat him to some ice cream one saturday, so we hoped on BART and then walked the rest of the way to the Creamery. For $5 you could get a 2-3 flavor 3 scoop bowl, a great deal for fresh ice cream. I got 2 scoops of chocolate and 1 scoop of eggnog with brandy, glad I only got 1 scoop since it's rich. My boyfriend got 1 scoop chocolate, 1 scoop vanilla and 1 scoop salted caramel, seriously he always picks great dishes whenever we go out and I really wanted to trade him! It was the perfect combination!! The seating is small inside, maybe 6 people total could fit, but why would you want to sit inside when you could walk across the street to the park and sit in the sunshine?! I'd love to return to this place, hopefully something in my future places me near Bi-Rite.

I absolutely love the banana ice cream. It is my favorite. It's like a ripe roasted banana in ice cream form. How wonderful is that? The texture is smooth, but not too cold, so you dont get a brain freeze. The downside to this place is that on hot days, the line extends way outside the store, thus for one, exposing you to the blazing sun and two, causes you the frustration of waiting behind 10-15 people to taste every flavor before deciding what to get. Also, I don't like any of the flavors except banana. Haha. So these 4 stars are for the banana flavor! :D It is just that scrumptious.

Great stuff.  The salted caramel and roasted banana were amazing. I'd say 4.5 since I can't pick a favorite ice cream place between Bi-Rite, Mitchell's, and Joe's, but right when I walked in the very sweet girl behind the counter said, "Hi, would you like some water?" and it was a perfect call since I probably walked five miles to get there.  So yeah, five stars. You can't go wrong with this place.

I'm kind of glad that I don't live closer to Bi-Rite because if I did, I'd eat it all the time and become a 400 lb heifer.  My absolute favorite flavor is coffee toffee.  Also thoroughly enjoy the balsamic strawberry, salted caramel, honey lavender, actually I would probably say all of them.  So this particular Friday evening, I tried to order my traditional combo of coffee toffee with balsamic strawberry only to find that there was no balsamic strawberry!  You should have seen my face drop when he said the strawberry wasn't in season.  I was so sad :(   Anyway, I guess it means that I'll just have to come back.  Yippee!

Very good tasting flavor, but like Jessica B. said, "the ice cream lacked a certain creamy quality". ( which Mitchell's ice cream does not lack, IMHO)  You really should try the salted caramel, and keep that in mind if the line at Mitchell's is really long...

I've heard so much about this place, but would always forget about it when I was in the neighborhood.  My sister and I chose a super-foggy evening for ice-cream, so there wasn't anyone else there.  The guy at the counter was adorable, super sweet and so enthusiastic about the ice cream!  He told us to sample as many as we wanted, and was excited that it was our first time there.  After much deliberation, my sister got the malted vanilla w/peanut brittle and chocolate, and I got the roasted banana with shaved chocolate on top.  Oh. My. God.    We were both in complete ice cream heaven.  We'll both be back VERY soon!

It's ice cream!  It's not easy to mess it up.  These guys do it right.  I love the flavors.  Stuff you usually only find in fine-dining restaurants like creme fraiche or salted caramel.  Only complaint is that the creme fraiche is a tad icy sometimes, and today the line was WAY too long.  But that is the price I must pay for going on a sunny, warm Sunday at 3:00 in the afternoon.

(Damn, 340th person to review this place, they are hot) The ice cream is one of the BEST ice creams ever. They even caramelize the banana in the banana split so that it has the hard thin browned sugar skin that creme brule has.  Still, i like ice cream plain best, and it's good to eat it like that here because you get it in one of their compostable bowls with a flat wooden paddle stick-spoon, both which are awfully elitist-but-in-that-stylish-cute-way.  But the ice cream is so good that the wooden taste from the little paddle stick spoon gets a little invasive.  If you get a sundae you get a compostable plastic-ish spoon instead. Every ice cream I tasted was PERFECT.  All depends on what you're feeling at the moment, I was feeling lemony and lavender-honey, but they have something for every mood. They also have a bike rack outside which is nice because ice cream tastes 10x better after riding all around, so i would recommend that to make it the best of the best.

What can I say? Luscious and dreamy Salted Caramel! A wonder of science and taste! Whoever decided this magnificent flavour combo is a genius. It works so well because the texture is creamy and the taste is never cloying. I sampled the peanut butter with fleur de sel. Awesome as well. The salted caramel in a cup, with a scoop of the Roasted Banana was a great way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon recently. Two scoops for $4.25. And, what do you know? A parking space on Dolores that was essentially the left hand lane! I couldn't resist!

I had salted caramel and my hubby had a brownie sundae.  Both were great and I like that they are green (compostable dishes/spoons and reminders on napkin dispensers that napkins come from trees).  I was secretly hoping that the salted caramel ice cream would somewhat mirror what I've had at Pizzeria Picco in Larkspur (vanilla soft serve with caramel sauce and sea salt) but it was different.  I shouldn't have been trying to compare!!!

I actually don't really even like ice cream, but I LOVE Bi-Rite!!!  My favorite flavor is easily Honey Lavender, which they always seems to have, and my second favorite is mint chocolate chip. The staff are always friendly and have a great way of encouraging you to enjoy tasting flavors and moving the crowd thru quickly. Expect a crowd any warm day or night. If it's a hot day, the line can reach the corner, and it's worth the wait. No other ice cream like it. Tried the Sam's Sundae w/olive oil and thought I was worth trying but wasn't addicted---as I am to honey lavender.  Noy a good place for kids expecting bright artificial colored ice cream or sherbets.

Less like ice cream--more like lard in a cup.  I'd say the same for their hot cocoa.  I don't especially care if my refrigerated decadence is associated with gourmet ingredients or flavors.  All I need is for it to be smooth, light tasting, and refreshing.  If it's cheap, all the better.

5 stars for BiRite!!! I had their ice cream today..and decided to get their salted caramel because it was their popular flavor and bro got their coffee toffee...once we got it..i couldn't wait to get back to the car i had to try some right away! The first few spoonfuls was orgasmic!! It was like nothing i've ever had before...the saltiness plus the creaminess of the caramel was a perfect match! I'm personally not a huge fan of caramel because im a little sensitive to EXTREMELY sweet and sugary flavors...but the salt made it a perfect harmonious paradise in your mouth...mmmmmmm. Their flavors are special and unique like balsamic strawberry and honey lavender..and ginger..but also have your classic flavors like coffee toffee. Oh yeah...we accidentally walked into the deli market first...thinking the creamery was maybe in the back of the store? It wasn't...it's actually at another location down the block....we wasted valuable seconds where we could've waited in line...when we got there it was around 5:30 or so on a sunday evening..and there were still around 15 people ahead of us..now that tells you something! SO DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE...MAKE SURE IT SAYS BIRITE CREAMERY OUTSIDE.  Oh yea..and they also deserve 5 stars due to their environmental friendly green compost bin! They give wooden spoons..and paper bowls out and expect their customers to finish their ice cream there so they can dump them out in the green bin. YAY for environmental friendly establishments! One more thing...location was a plus...niice friendly neighborhood close by to where I live...and parking was a breeze. Great ice cream on a sunny sunday evening...does it get any better than that?!

No doubt that their ice cream flavors are unique.  That's what makes them good. I would go here just because you can't those those flavors anywhere else (unlike Mitchell's).  I tasted their salty caramel, which is kinda too strong for me, so I opted the Cinnamon with Snicker doodles. It was pretty good though I expected a bit more.  I think I will go back to try out their other flavors.

i'm not a very reliable reviewer because when i go out to eat i tend to get only one thing all the time, never trying anything else.  such is the case with bi-rite.  i only get the salted caramel and refuse to try anything else because i love salted caramel.  oh... wait, i've had lavendar (i think it's a flavor that they have unless i'm thinking of mitchell's) and ginger flavors.  mmm, not a fan of either, because, well, lavendar is a weird flavor to begin with, and the ginger flavor tastes very similar to salted caramel but salted caramel is better so might as well just get that.  but one of these days i should check to see if they have mint chip.  mmm, looking forward to that. i love that this place is located next to dolores park... nothing beats a warm day hanging out at the park with a bi-rite scoop in cone in hand.  i think every time i am in the mission i always stop by.  and... even in cold weather i bother to get a scoop because that's when there are no lines!

I love the salted caramel, though it is little too sweet for me, but the creme fraiche is where it's at!  I like the clean, slightly tangy taste, which left me refreshed and very satisfied, a wonderful sensation which does not always occur after I eat desserts.  The coffee toffee and brown butter pecan are also really good.  If you like ice cream, you need to check this place out.

The first time I had a Sam's sundae was at Bi-Rite, and it was pretty darn tasty.  I can't believe I haven't been to this place before, but at the same time, at least I didn't miss out.  I don't know if I have ever had organic ice cream before, but it tastes just as good, if not more delicious, than regular ice cream.  I'd definitely take this over Fenton's, and while I enjoy pretty much any delicious home made ice cream, I'm going to again stress the fact that this place is organic and agree with Preeti B's review: "If the ice cream is organic, you don't need to feel any indulgence guilt".  Enough said.

I don't understand all the buzz. M/b I tried the wrong flavors.  The honey lavendar made my mouth feel like I'd sucked on soap...the heavy, oily feel of lavendar. Meh. The balsamic strawberry was so-so, but give me regular old strawberry from Baskin Robins any day and I'm happy.

I finally now know what all the fuss is about... the quality of the goods at this place make it a) worth the wait and b) capable of inducing a euphoria akin to an orgasm!  I swear - coffee toffee + richanelas (cinnamon ice cream studded with snickerdoodles) literally made me jizz my pants in front of everyone!  OK... so maybe that was just the cream melting down off the side of my cup onto my pants... but man, I'd be proud of that jizz after this experience - not embarrassed :).  It seriously is THAT good.  Any haters just really don't get it... this is one of those "only in San Francisco" type of places... I'm so glad I live in a town of foodies like me!!!

Crossed the street for ice cream after dinner at Delfina.  The line for ice cream was about 15 people long at 9:30 pm but well worth the wait.  They specialize in hand-crafted, somewhat exotic flavors.  The salty caramel ice cream was divine.   They close promptly at 10pm and did turn away some very sad people who had been waiting in line.  I've had a lot of good ice cream in my life but this was the best!

If you haven't already noticed, I'm a dessert fiend.  So when there's buzz about a dessert spot, i am sooo there.  On another 7X& Big Eat mission, (YES, another one) I came here to try the Salted Caramel ice cream.  The thought of salt and caramel was kinda weird to me, but it's on the list, so I just had to try it.  I got a cup with a scoop of Salted Caramel and Coffee Toffee--- excellent combo! The ice cream is so rich, creamy, and delicious.  And why wouldn't it be, since it's made with all local, organic, sustainable ingredients-- nothing artificial.  They also serve your ice cream in biodegradable cups with wooden spoons.  I love it-- saving the Earth, one ice cream scoop at a time =)

Let me start out with the fact that I hate chocolate Ice cream, I love chocolate, but I hate chocolate ice cream... weird...I know so I watch a lot of food network, and I saw the episode, where this place was featured, and the way Aida was eating Sam's sundae, made me want to lick the screen. So, I couldn't get the thought of that damn sundae out of my head. I live in the richmond, so last week, on a hot day, I decided to just make the drive out there. I was skeptical about getting sam's sundae- only because I hate chocolate ice cream. Also, the combination of the olive oil and sea salt, seriously, who would have thought. My fear was that I would be disgusted by the chocolate ice cream, and I would be swallowing oil by the spoon fulls.... WRONG!!!- But- they gave me a sample, of the sundae on a spoon. It was so delicious I wanted to swallow the spoon whole- so I indulged, and can not wait to indulge again. I wish it was closer, but so worth it, I don't mind taking the drive out there. I didn't taste other flavors- but am ecstatic about their innovative flavors. Thats definitely my type of ice cream place! Can't wait to show it off to all my friends :)

On my last night before I left San Francisco, my gracious hosts remembered Bi-Rite Creamery and we drove at break-neck speeds to get there before closing time. We arrived with 10 minutes to spare and found the line snaking up the block. We estimated a long wait, but I decided I would stick around to see what this place was all about. The staff work their butts off to make sure everyone gets their ice cream in a timely manner, so the wait in line wasn't all that bad. They even tolerated my asking for 3 different samples, which I really appreciated. The flavors I tried were all very interesting and sometimes unexpected combinations, but all worked well as a whole. The ice cream was not icy at all and was smooth as it should be. I decided on the salted caramel. Oh my stars, so good! I'm usually more into fruit ice cream or sorbet, but I could not resist the salted caramel. I should have gotten 3 scoops of this =( I am already planning my next visit to San Francisco and Bi-Rite is definitely the first stop on my list.

My favorite flavors include toasted coconut, malted vanilla with peanut brittle, and salted caramel. Wowie.

Today was warm, by SF standards, and the line was certainly long for Bi-Rite.  But, the ice cream is well worth the rate.  I had the honey lavender and salted caramel.  The ice cream wasn't overly hard, but creamy with some firmness.  They have some really interesting sundaes including one that has olive oil as a topping (I'll try it next time).  Everyone else's reviews seem to echo mine: go here for ice cream; you won't be disappointed.

I'm not very patient so I hate lines. But, I do love ice cream. We had to wait at least 1/2 hour for our ice cream on our trip here. Luckily some of my friends and I were able to do some window shopping at the boutique on the corner while other friends held our place in line. The ice cream servers were very friendly and I loved that they gave you samples on real spoons rather than disposable spoons. That's one way to reduce some of the waste that goes into our landfills. I ended up with a salted caramel and creme fraiche cone. It was good but not spectacular. I'm not sure that I would be up to waiting another 1/2 hour for it next time. I would be back if the wait was shorter.

Such good ice cream...probably the best gourmet ice cream shop in the city. Before I quit eating dairy, I really liked the dark chocolate ice cream (or was it the Mexican one?), but you know what, they have just as good vegan ice cream, it's homemade and they use very quality ingredients. They also have baked goods, and the make yummy sundaes. The line is huge though, so get there as early as you can. And yes there's even a line during winter. Amazing!

salty caramel.. hands down the best flavor here. the fresh organic ingredients, and interesting flavors. they are very environment-friendly, the spoons are even compost-able!

Any ice cream joint with a line down the block on a cold, rainy day has got to be delicious. Bi-Rite Creamery did not disappoint. As someone lactose intolerant, I really appreciate that they have both sorbet and non-dairy ice cream. I had the chocolate coconut non-dairy ice cream with hot fudge, my boyfriend had roasted banana with the berry compote topping, and my other friends respectively had honey lavender, banana kiwi and ricanelas. The biggest hits were definitely the honey lavender and the roasted banana. My boyfriend also thinks the combo of roasted banana, berry compote and hot fudge is godly. Our only complaint is that the texture of the banana kiwi sorbet was a little off.. definitely too gooey. A minor complaint about a truly delightful creamery though.

here's another one in the long list of "ZOMG SALTED CARAMEL ICE CREAM NOMNOMNOM" reviews. actually, it really is ZOMG SALTED CARAMEL ICE CREAM NOMNOMNOM. i really didn't think it was going to be good. but i had to try it because it was on the 7x7 list, and well, my sister had tried it. i would not be outdone! i was afraid of the salt that i thought would come in the ice cream. would there be flakes sprinkled atop? would there be crystals hidden inside the scoop? well, no. it's not as salty as you would think. just like you add salt to baked goods to draw out the sweet notes, the salt provided the same result here. except, in the most delicious way imagined. think of it this way: think about the best caramel you've had ever - bi rite is better than that! yea, it will pretty much blow your mind. however, i couldn't JUST have caramel. i was going to have my ice cream and eat some more. so i ordered a single, in a sugar cone, of half salted caramel and half plain chocolate. now, i used to work at an ice cream store, so i know that good chocolate ice cream is hard to come across. and they actually did it pretty well. not too milky and not bitter either. but it paled in comparison to the salted caramel. btw, for you ice cream lovers out there, the best and probably only way you should have ice cream is to have it on a cone. and licked. that way, your sweet receptors, which are at the tip of your tongue, are subjected to the sweetness and the flavor is better emphasized. now, head over to birite. b/c i said so.

We came at almost 9:30 on a Tuesday night, the line was out the door even though it was raining pretty hard. It was well worth the wait. The salted caramel was was too salty for me and I'm a little dissapointed that we walked out the door with a pint based off all the reviews. We probably should have tasted it first. The brown sugar was AMAZING, so amazing that I could drive to the City every night just to get my fix. The Lavender Honey was super strong at first, but then after I got used to the taste it didn't seem so strong. It was like soothing tea. The Banana was divine. My boyfriend and brother both got the malted vanilla and I somehow missed out on getting a taste of it. Next time. One thing they're missing out on is Milkshakes. That is the only thing that could possibly make this place any better!

I'm not a big ice cream person (I usually pass up ice cream places for frozen yogurt), but this stuff is so good even I crave it all the time!  Best flavors are Earl Grey and Honey Lavender, IMHO.  If you plan to buy pints you can skip the line and go in the "exit" door, but I wouldn't suggest doing that your first time.  It's a much better idea to try a bunch of flavors and see what you like best.  The lines are long, but it's worth it!

I think I may have stumbled across the name Bi-Rite Creamery once while searching through Yelp, however what really made me want to go try it was a brief mentioning of it in Sunset magazine.  When I hear about lines being out the door and around the corner, something tells me it might be worth a shot to make a trip down to the Mission where there is NO parking. "It was worth it," concluded my husband, daughter, and me. There is the store counter that serves the ice cream in which the line went down to the corner. It was probably a 15 or 20 minute wait and not much of a time difference with the beloved Mitchells Ice Cream which we adore with all our hearts, so I'm not sure what people are complaining about. There is also a window counter with a much smaller line for soft serve ice cream and baked goods. If you are a play-it-safe type of ice cream person who only likes the classic chocolate-vanilla-strawberry flavors and would rather buy Dreyers at the store, then of course a place like this makes you wonder what the hype is about.  (Hence the Yelpers who are wondering what the big deal is). We like boring flavors too, but we all loved what we got! My 7 yr old preferred the chocolate vanilla swirl soft serve. The hub got a "make your own" sundae with mint chip ice cream, homemade graham cracker topping, chocolate fudge, and whipped cream. I am a boring single-scoop-of-strawberry type of girl who can't eat too much dessert, but guess what? I got a double size in a small bowl which allows you to choose 2-3 flavors. (The scoops aren't that big). Here's what I got and LOVED: Malted Vanilla w/ peanut brittle and milk chocolate bits, Salted Caramel (O!M!G!), and chocolate coconut (vegan). I didn't want it to end...ever... and I was sad when it did. Two other pluses besides the "Hooray For Ice Cream!" success were: 1) the employees at both the store and at the window counter were super nice and 2) their green ways.  They use compostable and biodegradable items (eco plastic spoons and compostable paper bowls for ice cream), use real silverware spoons for tasting, and have the recycle, landfill, and compost bins outside. A successful experience for sure. Bi-Rite is one of those places where you just have to try the unique flavors. I know next time I'm trying other flavors too!

Holy moly, salted caramel and vanilla swirl soft-serve ice cream!!! Their ingredients are all natural (from what I understand) which means that their flavors are true without any of that icky aftertaste you get from usual artificially flavored ice creams. I can't wait to go back and try more flavors! It's a good thing I don't live in San Francisco. This might be the best ice cream I have ever had. It's a good thing I don't live in San Francisco.

I love the salted caramel ice cream at Bi-Rite.  I could do without the Bergamot Olive Oil on the Sam's sundae. My first experience with Bi-Rite Creamery was through a pint size of salted caramel ice cream from the Bi-Rite market.  It was love at first taste.  The salted caramel ice cream was absolutely amazing.  Just the right amount of salt mixed in with the most rich caramel ice cream you'll ever have.  It was real caramel flavor; the kind where you boil sugar in a pot before it burns, not your cubes of caramel wrapped in plastic.   My second experience with Bi-Rite Creamery was through Sam's Sundae.  I saw this sundae on the food network's "The best thing I ever ate" and they gave such great reviews that I just had to try it.  Sam's sundae consists of 2 scoops of their chocolate ice cream, topped with Maldon sea salt, organic Bergamot olive oil and fresh whipped cream.  First bite, i was like "oh my god this is amazing!" The whipped cream was nice and fluffy and perfectly sweet.  The chocolate ice cream was rich, probably one of the best chocolate ice creams I've ever eaten.  The salt added a nice contrast to the chocolate flavor.  The olive oil was nice and fruity.  Then I had my second bite and all of a sudden the olive was too strong and was over powering everything else.  I ate a little more with the olive oil and finally just had to eat the sundae without the olive oil.  Don't get me wrong, the chocolate ice cream with the Maldon sea salt and fresh whipped cream were still super amazing - I'll just ask them to hold the olive oil.  Next time I'll have to try the Spicy Mexican Chocolate.  I hear that ones really good and I like the heat.

If you're in line before closing, you're all good!  An employee is sent out to stand in line and designate the last patron.  I don't recall his name, but the guy at the soft serve window was really helpful.  Go there if you want to buy pints or ice cream sandwiches.  The balsamic strawberry with sugar cookies was delectable, and I wish I bought two so I wouldn't have had to share with HKB and his friend.  I'm selfish when it comes to my desserts!  The salted caramel cupcake was dry, so I'll stick to the ice cream.

This place is awesome! 3000 reviews and 4.5 stars?! Not over-hyped! They make everything by hand using natural ingredients, offer some more interesting flavors, and generously let you try anything even if the line's crawling around the block. The people who work there are so friendly and unaffected that they'll pop each others' pimples while they serve customers! My favorite combo: banana + chocolate ice cream with candied pecan topping, skipping the pimple puss.

I'm not big on sweets but I do like ice cream.  Everyone likes the Salted Caramel because it's on the 7x7 list; however, my favorites include: Balsamic Strawberry, Brown Sugar with Ginger Caramel Swirl, and Honey Lavender.  The only negative about this spot is that you could be waiting quit a bit for ice cream.  Hopefully, you'll be waiting with good company!  :)

Best god damned ice cream on earth.  Don't be scared by the line and grab some.  Then while you are people watching in Dolores Park you will have the secret knowledge that life is indeed wonderful.  My favorite is the Banana Split.  So simple but so divine. Truly VANILLA ice cream, house made whipped cream(not that nasty spray stuff), and crunchy caramelized banana slices drizzled lightly with chocolate.

I had heard so many great things about this place we had to head to the mission to try it. I'm so glad we did. The salted caramel ice cream is my favorite. So rich and creamy with just enough salt to balance it out.  Their honey lavender was lovely as well. I require them now from time to time. I'm hooked!

I was having dinner at Anchor Oyster Bar on Castro Street@19th, and other dinners recommended BiRite. It's on the 18th, so about 10mins walk distance. The special now is pumpkin, and candy cane ice cream, so I picked pumpkin and asked the guy behind counter what would be good with pumpkin. He suggested cinnamon and turned out the cinnamon was so good that I just LOVE it. It's Dec but I was happy with the dinner, the ice-cream, so just sit outside and looked at who bunch of Santas walk by. :-)

I absolutely love their salted caramel ice cream. This is my battle plan: I make sure this is the last stop I make if I'm in San Francisco, and I buy two pints of ice cream:  salted caramel and roasted banana.  Then I drive home as fast as I can, keep my fingers crossed that I don't get a speeding ticket, and try not to trip over my dog as I'm running to the freezer.   This allows me to spread out my bliss over a longer period of time until my next trip to the city.  :)

Omg, melt in your mouth heaven! We came here wanting to try Sam's Sundae on "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" with the olive oil and accidentally went  into the market across the street (which by the way has really fresh produce and great cheeses), but instead the Afternoon Snack Sundae caught our eye when we read "roasted banana" ice cream. The flavors blended well together with the roasted banana ice cream and home-made graham crackers which had a caramelized taste. Topped with fresh caramel sauce yum wise choice! I'm not a big fan of chocolate ice cream anyways so this was an interesting flavor to try. They don't have too many flavors here as they do change them throughout the season and many of their flavors are unique. This is the first time I've ever heard or tried a roasted banana ice cream. Lucky for us we went on a winter's weekday so there was barely a line. One time we drove by in the summer and the line was around the corner! Crossing my fingers I can come back soon.

bi-rite is still mighty good. apparently fat asses like me have caused bi-rite to stop offering more than 3 scoops on a cone.  however, they will hook it up with up to four scoops in a cup and then top it off with a cone. lols. i got: - ricanela: awesome!! i am biased because snickerdoodle is my favorite cookie. - brown butter pecan: so rich and delicious! - coffee toffee: nice hit of coffee but minimal toffee taste. btw, the homemade almond toffee topping is like sugary crack. omg!

It's good ice cream but not worth the long lines and impossible parking.  I've had the vaunted salted caramel, and while good, it's not all they say it is.  Overall, I like the texture of their ice cream, but the flavors could be a bit stronger/brighter.  I'd still give them a 3.5 - rounded up to a 4, though.

oh how i love thee, let me count the ways... 1. salted caramel icecream:  the best flavor ice cream with the perfect flavor, texture and consistency.  it melts fast so if you live far away good luck trying to get a tub home to your loved one.  i've actually roasted some bananas and cut them into the ice cream, it enhanced it a little (not that it needed any help at all) 2.  Ricanelas snickerdoodle icecream: i just love snickerdoodle, but man, when you put it in good icecream, it is divine. 3.  malted vanilla with peanut brittle and chocolate pieces 4.  balsamic strawberry, roasted banana and pretty much the entire menu. parking sucks, but i like this place a little better than humphry because they have more kid friendly icecreams and dolores park across the street.

There's more than 3000 reviews for this place so it doesn't really matter if I say that this place is good or bad. I'll just say that I really believe this place is worth it. There are long lines and limited seating but the ice cream here is awesome. Also, I think this place is a big part of San Francisco culture and you should definitely come here if you are visiting from out of town.

I've noticed in San Francisco when there is a line outside a food establishment it is usually gonna be damn good and worth the wait. Bi-Rite Creamery is no exception.  Run by the neat little market down the street, this little Ice Cream Parlor is something special.  They are the purveyer's of the greatest ice cream of all time... Honey Lavender.  You might not think that sounds too good, but trust me.  Get a couple spoonfulls in you and you will quickly see what I'm getting at.

I never thought I'd be raving over flavors of ice cream that involved salt (their salted caramel is incredible!), or roasted banana, or anything with ginger!

Definitely a place you want to check out if you've never been! Tried a bunch of the flavors but the only one that REALLY shined through and was memorable was the Salted Caramel! The establishment is really environmentally friendly, which I liked. Little tight on the seating, though. So be prepared to eat outside - perfect if it's a hot day!

The warm day in San Francisco turned into a windy cold.  I didn't care, having heard that this play had great Yelp reviews and I am an ice cream fanatic!  So I made sure I got to Bi Rite after dinner. The line was a little long, it was cold outside while waiting, and I didn't bring the best attire for such weather.  But!  It was all worth it.  The service was friendly, and most importantly the ice cream was incredibly great.  I had Salted Caramel, Coffee Toffee, and Ricanelas [a snickerdoodle ice cream].  In my opinion, Salted Caramel and Ricanelas are some of the best ice cream flavors I've ever had.

Bi-rite is the best ever! I love their ice cream even if it comes out to like 16$ per pint (vs like 3$ for one at your local grocery store). Everyone of course is raving about salted caramel and for good reason - its simply the best flavor i have ever had in my entire life. I also had Earl grey with this, amazing stuff really. I have been here 3 times really and I always get salted caramel + one other flavor. I have never been dissapointed. I will go and stand in that ridiculous line any day of the week, rain or shine, sleet or snow, I must go. Well too bad I dont live in the area anymore, but when I visit this is always on my list. I want some right now, i need to know a similar place in TX, please tell me anyone who can.

Hello lover... Yes, there is a huge and intimidating line in front of the store.  And yes, it is worth the wait.  This place has personality.  It's not your average vanilla (pardon the pun) ice cream store.  They are famous for their salted caramel ice cream, but it was a little too sweet for my tasting.  I had the brown sugar with ginger swirl ice cream, and it was to die for!  Make sure to taste a few samples before you make your decision.  If it were up to me, I would want to sample every one of them because they all look great!

i never write reviews. Matter of fact, this is my first. But this creamery deserves it.   After all my friends ordered a scoop of honey lavender ice cream (in addition to the unmissable salted caramel) one of the employees gave us a complimentary scoop of honey lavender + soaked in blood orange olive oil + drizzled with chocolate fudge + sprinkled with a hint of salt. which = heaven.

SOOO GOOD! even though my personal taste does not like salted caramel i finally see what the hype is about.. really good ice cream!!

While impressed, I am not floored by the experience.  I've had Hans, Scoops, and now Bi-Rite, but if you put them together in a blind taste test, I'd have some difficulty distinguishing them because they are all so darn delicious.  I figure if an ice cream creamery deserves a 5, I should be able to recognize it immediately. That said, it was small, the line wasn't too bad, and the ice cream was good.  If I'm up there, I would definitely go back -- but only if the line isn't long.  If it was, I would then go to Thrifty's.

I waited in line for 45 minutes until they advised us  that they had no vanilla ice cream... I understand, it happens; however, the employees were giving some customers free pints... the customers before and after me were given free pints of the good stuff, and I was charged for a chocolate cone and not even given an apology? What? This place left such a bad taste in my mouth, and its not the ice cream... but the customer service is horrible. IMO, no ice cream is worth $8 a pint, 45 minutes in line and horrible service. None.

I used to think that Mitchell's had the best ice cream in town, but I was proven pleasantly wrong.  The coffee flavor uses beans from Ritual Roasters for an end product so good that it almost feels wrong.  The price is ridiculous and the line moves way too slow, but when you are the best you get to dictate your terms.  Only 4 stars? no more ice cream for me!

My friend and I were having a SF adventure yesterday and at some point he lost his phone and was bummed about it.  We happened to be on our way to the Mission-Dolores park and he wanted to stop here to get some ice cream to cheer himself up.  The service was awesome and very quick, despite a line out the door (even in the cold weather they were still super busy...a good sign).  I had the honey-lavender which was so yummy!  Only about three dollars for a huge cup of deliciousness....yes!  We walked to the park and ate and while his phone is still gone, the ice cream definetely helped.  Also, their cups and spoons (the wooden stick kind!) are compostable.

Currently, my favorite place for ice cream, besides my own kitchen. If we needed an excuse to visit our best friends, who reside in the Mission (and no, we don't), stopping for a late night cone at Bi-Rite would be it. Nothing better than getting a sugar high while sitting on the benches in front of Bi-Rite  - my favorite might be banana, but the salted caramel is also worth two sticky thumbs up. I also appreciate that you can get two flavors per scoop - so you never have to totally decide (the long line gives you time to make up your mind about what to order at least 3 times).

...meh personally i think it's overrated. it was good, but not that great. i think it was too sweet and a little too creamy. maybe it's just because i like lighter things. but i would have liked if they had a selection that was lighter. it was so crowded i didn't even have time to think, just randomly chose some, and of course tried some of the famed salted caramel. it was good. but still. overrated.

This is definitely a destination spot, and worth the trip from wherever you're coming from. Or...you can deliberately find a job close by so you can come during lunch hour on a weekday afternoon, skip the lines, and try all 8 flavors that they happily hand out on silver spoons,and leave with salted caramel and brown sugar ginger deliciousness and a smile.

I was skeptical and I'm not a huge ice cream fan, but everyone was raving about this place.  I went after dinner at Farina to grab some of this stuff with 4 friends.  There was a line on a Friday night at 10pm (which I found odd).  However, once I had the ice cream, I knew the reason.  It's the best ice cream I've ever tasted.  I had a medium cone of some sort of Vanilla and wow.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.

The ice cream is ok.  I think it may be a little overhyped, but it was pretty good.  There was a line out the door but the service was quick.  The prices may be a little higher than I expected, but still not too bad.  I am a sucker for ice cream and frozen yogurt so I am sure I will be back to try more.

Went here today on a Saturday around 6pm and there was no line.  The place was clean and small with only 3 stools for sitting.  Each flavor we got (Salted Caramel, Mint Chip and Coffee Toffee) was straight to the point.  Full flavor, creamy and buttery.  I'd go back if I were in the area.

The reviews are right. It's really that good. I was skeptical that it wouldn't live up to the hype...but it did. I love that with the single you can get two flavors. I am very indecisive, so that was a nice surprise. I got the salted caramel (how could I not) and the ricoletto (sp?). Mmmm, I loved them both. The salted caramel was different than I imagined, it tasted like this great sea-foam candy that my grandmother always gets. The ricoletto is cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodles (my favorite cookie) mixed in. I can't stop telling people to go here. I'm glad I don't live closer to it, because I'm sure I would be going way too often.

The best thing about Bi-Rite Creamery is it's not too close to my house.  I would be a massive lump of fat!  I love the salted caramel ice cream.  Actually, I love everything I've tried.  This stuff must be at least 30% butter fat.  That being said, it's great for a treat but, be warned... it's going to get you with the bait and set the hook.  You will be a helpless slave to this stuff.

I "popped my bi-rite cherry" last week, so to speak, and learned what the hype has been about. It's the nontraditional ice cream flavors like Salted Caramel and Honey Lavender, which REALLY taste like their descriptions! I'm talking about intense flavoring that doesn't lead to second-guessing "oh this could be raspberry instead of strawberry." And I tried a few spoons of my date's brownie sundae. Wow, that was heaven in my mouth. Plus you have lovely Dolores Park across the street, so this is a perfect place to go on a sunny day. I'd go back to try the other flavors, and remember next time to offer my companion some of my cone... (sorry!).

Ordered the vegan chocolate coconut and the balsamic strawberry. It was definitely worth the half and hour wait. The flavors aren't as intense as Ici's (I still think their chocolate ice cream is the best I've had to date). But the ice cream tastes lighter and fluffier, which I tend to prefer. I was surprised by the chocolate coconut, the texture looks icy but looks can be deceiving! The ice cream melts in your mouth upon contact. I think the balsamic enhanced the strawberry flavor, but my friend thought it was weird. The staff is very friendly and patient. Despite the long line, there weren't any irritable customers. In fact, you almost develop commradery as you wait together admist the air of excitement and anticipation (and indecisiveness because they have so many flavors!) Definitely coming back again!

This ice cream is as good as it gets.  In the three years I have lived in San Francisco and always avoided the long lines at Bi-Rite, I finally decided to give in one hot sunny day at Dolores Park and see what it was all about.  I figured one scoop wouldn't hurt the no-ice-cream diet I'm on, but when I finally got through the line and saw all of the interesting and exotic flavors, i ended up with three flavors on my cone!  They're all all interesting and make the looooong lines worth it.

The brownie sundae with caramel seasalt ice cream was fantastic.  The candied pecans were so much better than the brownie that I almost wished they hadn't given us such a big piece of brownie. The only thing that kept them from getting the fifth star was water - they need to have a pitcher of water.  The sundae was a little on the salty side and left me pretty thirsty.

There's a reason why you'll often find a long line outside this spot waiting for even just a taste of their ice-cream.  IT's that good.  I've gone here only 2 times, but maybe upon future and (repeatedly pleasant experiences I'll give it 5 stars).  The service is really good, they'll let you sample whatever you want and don't get annoyed if you want to try more than one flavor (customers waiting behind you, might haha).  I like anything caramel/toffee so that's what I've gotten each time (of course not without sampling the other flavors and all were just as good).

This place is rather amazing. I would say, that when it comes to texture their ice cream is high quality, but nothing earth shattering. What is earth shattering are the flavor combinations. They are subtle, but well balanced with the dairy. I got cherry almond which was amazing, because I love those two flavors since they are botanical brothers, but I digress. I also got the creme fraiche, which has an amazing tartness to it, kind of like full-fat yogurt, or sour cream. The strawberry balsamic was definitely good, and I would recommend it. I also tried the vanilla soft serve which was good, but had an interesting taste  in my opinion. They also have cupcakes, but I wouldn't bother - stick with the ice cream! Cash only FYI, and typically, there is a line out the door.

Absolutely fantastic! I tried the Lavender Honey, and the Roasted Banana. Both of them are incredibly wonderful as ice creams. Store bought ice cream, or even coldstone doesn't hold a candle to Birite. I think the difference is that birite's ice cream seems to have a lot of subtlety to it, the roasted banana for sure tasted like a ripe banana instead of a sugary bananaish thing that most ones are. Fantastic!

I always have to try and stop here if I'm in the area. Best flavors are honey lavender, salted caramel, and roasted banana. I also love the "Sam's Sundae" with chocolate ice cream, handmade whip cream, bergamot infused olive oil, and a pinch of sea salt. I usually hate chocolate ice cream since it's too heavy, but this one is lighter tasting and refreshing. Expensive compared to other ice cream shops, but so worth it if you think of the effort and money that goes into making small batches every day.

I've tried the salted caramel, honey lavender, malted vanilla, and ricanelas. The ones I tried were really creamy and light, and the texture lacked the undesirable grainy sugary feel that some ice creams have.   Each were very tasty and unique in flavor in comparison to other ice cream parlors, but for me, nothing beats the ricanelas!  Its flavor resembles that of cinnamon toast crunch with milk.  Sounds ridiculous that cinnamon toast crunch in the form of ice cream could be that amazing, but don't knock it until you try it.  I went back several times in one weekend for scoops in that flavor, and wanted to kick myself in the face for not having simply purchased a bucket of the ricanelas.  Try it out, and enjoy!

Ice cream, sex and sunshine are among my favorite things in the world. But since we are on the topic of ice cream i will have you know i am an ice cream conoseur and absolutely am always on a quest for the best. My personal favorite ice cream in the city is Birite Creamery. There is a reason there is a line around the block on any given  sunny day. Their flavors are rich and real, no artificial or preservative crap. I love banana ice cream when its done right and their roasted banana is an orgasmic and creamy blend of real banana and brown sugar. Other flavors are just as decadent like salted caramel, balsamic strawberry, among others that make you salivate.  The price is really reasonable too for the quality you are getting. And their home made fudge and toppings are made fresh daily. While they may be a really small business they are very efficient and the line moves fast. I also admire that they don't use plastic testing spoons for the environments sake, they use real metal spoons and compostable spoons and bowls.  And to put the cherry on top the staff's not too bad looking either... So next time you are near Dolores Park, wait in line (its so worth it) and go sit and the park and enjoy the genius

One star off for the 30 minute wait, but other than that it was a party in my mouth!  After reading all the reviews I had the salted caramel, and also tried the honey lavender, nom nom nom!  My bf's brown butter pecan was okay, but not as good as the other flavors.  I should've gotten a cone, though, because I have a weird dislike of wooden spoons!

Tasty tasty stuff.  There is always a line here but if it goes to the corner, know that it's only about a 15 minute wait.  The line moves quite efficiently.  Good service and good flavors.  Especially on a sunny day in D-park.  Only 4 stars because I personally reserve 5 stars for something that blows my mind away and while I've had mind blowing ice cream, Bi-Rite doesn't quite get to that level but they definitely have some tasty flavors.

Amazing ice cream.  Every flavor is creamy and smooth.  Try the salted carmel--i think it's the best.  There was a line to the corner when I went (Saturday afternoon), but it moves quickly.  Also, try the flavors as you're deciding what to get.  Everything there is great.

I went here last weekend after reading a lot of positive reviews. I've NEVER been so disappointed with anything after being referred to a product or service. I tried four flavors and was, at best, unimpressed with any of them. First, the salted caramel, which seemed to be the most popular choice: Though I'm not sodium dependent as so many other people (I don't even cook with it), this ice cream was far too salty, with no balance of flavor, not particularly rich. The aftertaste was bitter, leaving me to anticipate my next flavor... The brown sugar/ginger: The ginger overwhelmed and didn't complement the sweetness. I'm not sure if this was equally bitter to the salted caramel, but it was time for another palate cleansing, then on to the next flavor. Balsamic Strawberry: This was probably the least offensive flavor. While the balsamic vinegar balanced the otherwise sweetness of most strawberry ice creams, it also did very little to complement the flavor. It was the richest, creamiest of those I tried, but still fell far short of my expectations. Finally, the Ricanellas (cinnamon w/snickerdoodles): This flavor was the closest to any other quality ice creams that I've eaten. The cookie pieces did very little but to provide cheap filler ingredients. While it was most easily palatable, it's relative inferior quality left me wanting for NO MORE. I have been travelling 40 miles to the city since 2005, sometimes just to get Mitchell's ice cream, as I have found none better. I'll be writing a review in a couple days after my return from my next venture. There is no way to compare the two, as their products have few similarities. For Bi Rite, I'd add one star for their customer service, as their employees are very friendly and will allow you to sample several flavors. But, because of their helpfulness, I'd subtract 1/2 star for the long lines and another 1/2 for the small portions and inflated prices. If you are a true aficianado, you might agree with my review. Try Mitchell's or Humphry Slocombe's. If you are a common ice cream eater that is easy to please, you might also agree. Try Fenton's or Loard's Ice Cream in Oakland. If you are pretentious and want to provide a socially acceptable opinion for fear that your peers will otherwise think less of you (thus bruise your ego), then you might disagree with my review. Keep coming here and be happy in your narrow-sightedness. I'm not sugar-coating anything here. Thoughts of favorite things don't wet my pants like they do for some other people. My opinions are partly subjective, of course, but I take into account the fact that people's tastes vary. I don't dispute the quality of the ingredients, but the finished product does not merit a better rating; (using the McDonald's analogy again) If I ordered a soft serve, I would rate it three stars, as I would expect no more for the price. I expect to "get what I pay for" (in quotations, as I would never end a sentence with a preposition). My expectations were not met.

HOLD YOUR HORSES, WAKE THE CHILDREN, SMACK YOUR BOSS IN THE FACE, HEAVEN IS HERE!!!!! I was graced by the hand of God to forgo this wonderous treasure just the other night. I was having dinner with some friends and we all had a craving for some ice cream. I had had frozen yogurt for about a month now, so I knew it was time to visit my old love ice cream. Much to my surprise there was a place just a few blocks away from the restaurant and we went on our search. This quaint little corner shop was anything but a secret hideout. A line formed out the door with a few individuals already enjoying a few scoops of this scrumptious delight. I was quite excited as I waited in line, even though it was a bit of a wait, everyone knows that when there's a line its going to be worth it. And it certainly was! The store was brightly lit, scents of ice cream and waffles eminated out the door. The menu was handwritten, which I found quite adorable. The flavors were all written in various colors on a chalk board, all with common names and also some that were quite intriguing. I had a sample of the Earl Gray Tea and the Honey Lavender. Aside from the flavor, there was the debacle of size, cup or cone, toppings or no toppings. So many decisions for just one woman. I decided upon the single cone with Honey Lavender and Balsamic Strawberry also adding the cookie of the day as my topping. Sadly cones couldn't receive a topping buddy, so the server graciously suggested putting my ice cream in a cup and sticking the cone on top. I was thrilled at the idea and at the moment I took my first bite, I was not disappointed. The flavors hit you like lightning, they shocked the system, electrifying every single taste bud. It was, and I will gently say this, the most orgasmic sensation you will ever feel in your entire life! The two flavors, mixed with a waffle cone and powder sugar covered cookie was indeed a heavenly experience. I have found euphoria and its name is BiRite :).

Went here for dessert after Ike's (don't judge the degree of fattiness) and was immediately daunted by the writing on the freezer case holding the freshly made ice cream; it kinda looked like a science class lecture which made my brain shut down since I have been repeatedly traumatized by those classes. But I took a deep breath, ignored it, and asked for samples of flavors that piqued my interest. In the end I got a single of the salted caramel and malted vanilla with peanut brittle. The staff will ask if you want them to pair samples for you too, which follows my ice cream eating philosophy of having more than one flavor in the same bowl (again, don't judge). The honey lavender surprised me but I knew it would end up being too sweet after a couple of bites. Salted caramel was my favorite although the malted vanilla was good too, except I didn't get a strong malt flavor/sensation. Ideally I wanted to try all the flavors but I didn't want to be THAT person. The boyfriend got ricanelas (snickerdoodle with cinnamon swirl) and brown sugar. Even though it was cold, I really liked the flavors of my picks and the smooth creamy consistency that made me feel like the gourmet hipster ice cream is on point with the hype.

I went with some buddies and got a double consisting of the salted caramel as well as the coconut. The salted caramel tasted a bit like burnt caramel and wasn't quite right for me, but the coconut was awesome. It was delicious on it's own, but they even added some bits of coconut in the ice cream, which was a nice touch.  I also tasted a little of some cinnamon ice cream and banana, which made me wish I had gotten either of those instead of the salted caramel. Maybe a bit pricey, but this place is delicious and so close to Dolores Park!

Not much more needs to be said. The Salted Caramel is a MUST GET. If you're like me and love creamy vanilla ice cream, but like additional texture you should get Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces. It's delicious and goes well with Salted Caramel. I just wish they had hazelnut chocolate ice cream and pistachio. :)

I have a deep love affair with lavender ice cream, and Bi-Rite's Honey Lavender flavor sends me to could nine.  The line is usually out the door, so if you want to skip it, grab a pint or quart from the freezer next to the cash register.  If you're not in a hurry, stay in line and try all the yummy flavors first!

First I would like to say that my friends and I are icecream FANATICS! Needles to say we have tried many many types of icecream. We all found this place to be great. I disagree with the other reviewers saying that the icecream was nothing special. The icecream is very flavorful, creamy etc etc. I do however agree that it is very overpriced. I go here one in a while because if I went as much as I wanted to - I would be broke! I also agree that the service is one of the wost. It is a total crap shoot, some of the workers are super nice and others seem like they need prozac administered intravenously. I also agree that there are too many yuppies from out of the area. While I do not mind that others come in from outside the neighborhood - I do care when they are absolutely obnoxious, snobby, pretentious etc etc.

This place is so perfect it makes Ritual seem like starbucks.  I'm sorry, but it's true.  You step in, the system is flawless.  They heap silver teaspoons with loadsa cream.  The flavors are varied by high-class.  The staff is super friendly and patient.  The size of the small shoppe feels cozy and there are enough chairs inside and out.  The menu gives you enough to work with depending on your appetite and it's all priced point-perfect.  Even in 40 degree weather on a windy SF-day, I never miss my weekly dose of bi-rite creamery.  (PS.  I accept that Mitchell's is a SF staple.  However, the comparison between the two is like comparing Bill's Hamburgers to Burger Joint--crude and dated.)

On a late Sunday evening, with a line out the door and the surly counter staff trying to close the place (I'm not deducting any stars for that, by the way), I managed to score some Bi-Rite salted caramel ice cream.  It was my first taste of Bi-Rite ice cream and I've been fantasizing about it ever since.  I actually feel guilty that I went there without my significant other and then had to sheepishly explain to him how orgasmically good that salted caramel ice cream scoop was.  FYI, as another reviewer wrote, the single scoop was actually quite plentiful for a single.

I LOOOOOVE Bi-Rite!  I've been to Tara's Organic Ice Cream in the Berkeley/Oakland area, and I've been to Ici as well.  They're both really good, and have similarities like small batches and unique flavors, but Bi-Rite just kicks it up a notch and they're really the best.  Bi-Rite also gives bigger scoops than Ici and Tara's, so that makes me happy.  Bigger scoops of anything that good is just automatic bonus points.  My favorite flavors are Honey Lavendar, Malted Vanilla, Balsamic Strawberry and Salted Caramel.  I always get those and I haven't branched out to other flavors yet because those ones are so fantastic!   To compare Bi-Rite to another San Francisco (ice cream) landmark, Mitchells:  Mitchell's has bigger scoops and Filipino flavors and is close to my heart because my family has been going there for years, but Bi-Rite is so fresh and the ingredients are just excellent.   There is also a place in Fairfax (Marin County) that also has excellent ice cream, called the Fairfax Scoop.  They also use the Straus Family Creamery which is a small organic farm.  I would go there more often if it wasn't so far away.  It's so worth it if you're in Marin--it's just like Bi-Rite, including the long line!  :)

Been here several times, and have several different flavors. I think you can tell good quality ice cream from tasting the vanilla flavor, and I must say... this ice cream place was yummm didily. However, you must know that I have not only tried the vanilla. I've tried other flavors such as coffee-toffee, butter pecan, cookies & cream, (tres leches?? i think) and they have all been very flavorful. I'll be back for more! BTW, I like this place better then Mitchell's because the flavors are great and you can by-pass the ridiculous lines at Mitchell's.

We came here after a fantabulous meal at L'Ardoise on Noe Street.  Typically, we eat lower cal ice cream and froyo so it was an adjustment for us to have the real thing.  It was an adjustment that i would happily make time and time again.  My friend told us about this place and I thought it was one of those drug stores with ice cream.  I had some kind of cinnamon ice cream that was tremendous.  My friend had something with the word tuxedo in it that was even better.  My non-dairy wife and coconut chocolate which was even better.  Bi-rite is just up the block from one of the great bakeries in SF (Tartine)so you can really get fat AND happy on this block.

My husband and I have been living in San Francisco for about 6 months and just about everyone we meet highly recommends BiRite Creamery when ice cream is on the mind!  We got there just before close (around 9:50pm) and we ordered the Salted Caramel and it was just as delicious as all the fans describe.  My husband, however, felt it was too salty and probably will not order that flavor again. But we both agreed the texture was amazing, light, fluffy, creamy, perfect.  I ordered the kids cone, which I thought was plenty for an after dinner dessert.  My friends ordered the Strawberry Balsamic and thought it was good but have actually tried that flavor at Beachy Cream (http://beachycream.com) and think BC makes a better version.  Overall, I have to admit it is as good as everyone says, thank goodness it's not in our neighborhood so I won't be tempted to visit every evening!

Bi-Rite Creamery is the best ice cream I've had in San Francisco!  My favorite so far is the vegan chocolate coconut....I've had quite a few vegan ice creams and never liked any of them until I found this one!  YUM!

Expect a line!  This place is very popular, even at 10pm on a Friday.   The daily flavors are posted on the door and on the board. I tried the salted caramel and didn't care for it.  But I really liked the balsamic strawberry and the white chocolate with a blackberry swirl.  The vanilla is the best I've ever tasted.  The cookies n cream was average.   If you want the soft serve, go to the doorway on the right. If you want a pre-packed quart, go to the door on the left.  The freezer will be on the right.  You pick a quart and step up to the right side of the counter to pay. Only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because there isn't much seating and parking is a real pain. Next time I will have a sundae, I've heard good things about their fudge sauce!  And they use real whipped cream, too.

I'm definitely an ice cream person, but my favorite flavor is Mint Chip and I am fine with having it every time I have ice cream. After waiting in line, I tried some of the flavors this place is known for, including Salted Caramel and Honey Lavender, but neither flavor appealed to me so I decided just to go with my Mint Chip. I was very disappointed with the Mint Chip - the taste was kind of flavorless and there are better places for it in San Francisco. However, I do love Bi-Rite's location, the neighborhood and the fact that it's right across from Dolores Park, All in all, I don't it's worth the wait and hype. Maybe it's just because  I'm not really attracted to the unique flavors this place known for, but I probably won't go back.

i would rate this place 10 stars if i could. favorite flavor is coffee toffee. i get it every time i go there.  I have tried other flavors such as balsamic strawberry, ricanelas, salted caramel, and the lavender.  All of them were good! the line is well worth it.  it should take up to 15-20 minutes to get your order but if you don't want to wait, there is a freezer in there too that has ice cream pints, ice cream sandwiches, and cakes i think that can be purchased then and there.   they offer stamp cards, every 10 stamps, get a free scoop.  It is in a reasonable price range, and if I'm not mistaken, they take cash and cards. The only thing i would say is that their location could be better.  It is right near a park on dolores and i think that is partly to blame for lines, and the place itself is small.   but other than that, this is my favorite ice cream place in San Francisco!

I am on a quest to find the best places for food when I visit a city, and damnit I mean it!  We were trekking around SF seeing sights, people, places and most of it via trolley cars or bus and to try and get to Bi-Rite was about an hour venture from only 5 miles away.  But so worth it.   I've had some bad ice creams, and some amazing ones, and this is near the top of my list.  The way they push the boundaries of flavor here is not only delicious, but thoughtful as well.  Lavender is very hard to make perfectly palatable, without imparting either too much flavor (soapy) or too little (nothing).  The Honey Lavender was PERFECT.  the BF and I tried 6 different flavors, all were decadent, I wanted more!  THe only one I didn't care for was the Brown Sugar-ginger.. a bit too strong of a flavor for me, but my BF loved it.  The burnt caramel taste is a love/hate thing.  OMG.. Roasted banana is amazing.

I tried this place on my birthday this year and was surprised to find one of the best ice cream spots yet. I tried the strawberry balsamic, but settled on the honey-lavender (it was a tough choice), which tasted as fresh as it's name, and all the cakes and pastries looked delicious (too bad I was full from lunch). The staff was all very friendly and they all had great personalities and talked about what they recommend and seemed happy to be working there. The line is well worth it. Anyone in the area at least needs to TRY their stuff.

I will drive to sf every weekend for this icecream. we got there late on a saturday nifgt and the line was around the corner. This did not bother me because the line went fast and the icecream was the best. I had a two scoop sunday with brown butter pecan and salted caramel, topped with hot caramel, almond toffee and whipped cream. Everything here is homemade and you can can tell in the taste. Next time ill try the fruity flavors, im sure i will not be disapointed.

Excellent and exotic ice cream flavors. All are good, if some are over the top. The Salted Caramel is da bomb! Others are more of a novelty rather than a staple: Orange Cardamom, Malted Vanilla, Lavender, etc. Parking is impossible. GO with a buddy and drive around in circles as they wait in line.

I'm sure anything I could say about Bi-Rite has already been mentioned by other yelpers, but the ice cream is definitely worth a modest wait. And, as I found out tonight, the frozen yogurt (pumpkin + vanilla swirl) is worth it too (and probably won't even have a line)! I really want to try the cupcakes one day too, but it's so hard to go and NOT get something ice creamy.

A Creamery can only truly stand out, in my opinion, by two respects. Innovation, a difficulty task in a time ages after the invention of ice cream, and quality, a given. Bi-Rite Creamery is exceptional in both categories. Creativity? I don't know anywhere that can boast the claim to be greater. Quality? May I answer with a dare? I DARE you to find a place better. Salted Caramel with olive oil is such a culinarily stimulating idea and an absolute delight.

As if Bi-rite Creamery needs another raving review, but really, I just can't help myself...I LOVE their ice cream! They carry very unique flavors that taste amazing. You have to try their salted caramel (it really is as amazing as you've heard it to be), honey lavender, and coffee toffee. I'm sad I've never had the chance to try their Earl Grey flavor as I've heard so many good things about it.

Coming from the East Bay, there are two ice cream shops that pop out in my mind, Ici and Fentons.  Ici had many unique flavors, but was not creamy whereas Fentons had thick and rich ice cream, but not the gourmet edge.  I feel that Bi-Rite is a merging of the two.  I split four scoops: salted caramel, ricanelas (snickerdoodle), toasted banana, and cookies and cream.  All were tasty, but the best flavor was the caramel.  I definitely look forward to trying many of their other flavors.

The ice cream here is yummy, as can be seen from the long line out the door.  The flavors are unique and rich.  They have so many quirky flavor combinations, but they let you sample as many as you like before you decide on what you want.  I got the brown butter pecan and the brown sugar and my friend got the vanilla and honey lavender.  Everyone seems to love the salty caramel, but i've tried it before and I think it's a little too salty for me.  I can't wait to try to blood orange sorbet next time!

Just wanted to add another 5 star rating with the rest. My favorite ice cream in SF is still Mitchell's but Bi-rite is pretty darn close. Yes, there is always a line but it's worth it. Bi-rite has such delicious, unique flavors made of local and organic ingredients. Their salted caramel, is creamy and tasty. My other faves is the coffee toffee, with large bits of almond toffee and ricanelas, cinnamon-y with chunks of snickerdoodle. My sister loves their honey lavender and the kiddies loves their cookies & cream. Definitely one of my stops whenever I'm in SF.

We came here on a random rainy night so there wasn't too long of wait.  Arguably the best ice cream I've ever had.  Maybe it was because I had the snickerdoodle flavor and that's my favorite cookie....or maybe it was the lack of a lingering artificial taste that accompanies most ice creams.  No matter the reason, I wake up dreaming about this ice cream on random mornings.  I Love Bi-Rite.

I've ALWAYS wanted to go here since my cousins love their ice cream. What impresses me is that for an ice cream shop, they have over 3,000 yelp reviews. So I finally get the chance to go here last night w/Jan. Parking sucks here. We had to drive around a few times to find parking and eventually found a spot a few blocks away. What's funny though is that when we saw Bi-Rite, we saw that it was a crowded grocery. So we go inside thinking maybe the ice cream shop is in the back of the store...? We go back outside and I check the navigation on my phone about if we were at the right place or not and apparently Bi-Rite Creamery is down the street on the right. We felt pretty moded, but thought it was funny we got confused since they had the same name. Lol! Anyway, when we go inside we see it's a small shop and I wanted to try their Sam's Sundae since it sounds so odd I had to try it (btw, who is Sam and how did he create this odd combination?) I order that while Jan orders the banana split and I grab a pint of their famous salted caramel ice cream to take home. It's cool how w/their banana split, they pour a little sugar on the banana and then used a blow torch to caramelize it like creme brule. Never seen that done to a banana split before. We decide to eat our sundaes in the car since all the tables were taken. Jan's banana split was pretty good. He liked it as well. My Sam's Sundae on the other hand was very interesting tasting, but the salt they sprinkle on top was HELLA SUPER salty. I thought the chocolate ice cream, whip cream and the bergamot olive oil was interesting by itselt, but the salt hella threw it off for me. Jan didn't like the Sam's Sundae at all. He thought it was just weird. The salted caramel ice cream's really unique. You can really taste the buttery caramel flavor in it. Not too sweet yet not overwhelming w/caramel flavor. Really good! Reminds me of caramel corn, but in ice cream form. I'd definitely like to go back to try their other flavors. (4/5/11-Dammit Bi-Rite! Why is your salted caramel ice cream SOOO good?! I'm officially addicted that my fat ass has been going there every week to get some AND I'm about to head over there right now to get more quarts of it. Lol!)

Bi-rite has some of the best ice cream I've ever had.  Their selection of flavors is incredible, and they're always generous with the samples.  I usually get the salted caramel and the ricanelas (cinnamon ice cream with chunks of snickerdoodle cookies), with lots of samples in between.  The roasted banana is awesome, and so is the earl grey.  Both of them actually taste like the description, with no gross colorings or artificial flavors.  The fact that they use a lot of fresh, local ingredients makes this place even better.  There's often a line and parking can be hard to find, but it's totally worth it.

Love this place! There's always a line wrapped around the corner, but what can you expect when the shop has standing room for five people. It's so worth the wait. The staff is always friendly and they have no problem giving out samples of flavors. I loved the Balsamic Strawberry and Salted Caramel. The scoops were little and kind of expensive, but it's definitely worth the splurge. Plus, Bi-Rite is located right next to gorgeous Dolores Park. There's nothing better than enjoying your ice cream with that kind of view :)

Just moved onto 18th street on 3/1/11. It's now 6 wees later. Fuck. I am screwed.   Always intrigued by people standing in the rain waiting for ice cream, but simultaneously thinking that they are just really stupid and that this place is like Serendipity in NY, which is just way overrated. Last night I gave in. I have AT&T and don't have service in weird spots, like, my house. So I took a walk outside to chat with my mom. I walked by Bi-Rite about 4 times in that one hour, and then as I walked past the final time I stopped. I was the second person in line at the side bakery/togo window (the regular line was about 15 deep, no thanks). Got a pint of Salted Caramel for $7.99 (now at this point I am thinking I am just stupid). I get home, open it up, and share half of it with the beau. So delicious. I mean, freaking amazing. Like really effing good, creamy ice cream.  I now feel good about $7.99 that I paid. Just now, I had a couple bites from the half full pint. The bf will be home in about an hour. At that time I will ask him if he wants to split the rest of it. Maybe I will have one more bite before he gets home. Stop reading the reviews, just go get some. please.

While other "favorite" ice creams are all about the flavors, Bi-Rite is all about the foundation--super creamy, delicate, melt in your mouth goodness. After a couple bites I realized the sensation was similar to eating cotton candy, how it just melts away easily in your mouth. Lovely. I tried a standard flavor (I was kind of chicken and thought it would be a better test) and it was great.

If you need to squander some of your artery points, do them here.  Rich, creamy, subtle ice cream in a panoply of interesting flavors.   I've tried a few of the flavors but nothing beats the Salted Caramel which is not sickly sweet.    Orange Cardamom, Snickerdoodle were  was ho-hum.  The Lavender Honey is good but I have to be in the mood.   The only Con:  the line, especially on a nice day, likely will reach the end of the block but take a friend or two, music, book or just people watch and the time will pass more quickly.

I'm not a huge ice cream freak....99 our of 100 times, I'm more likely to seek out gelatos or sorbets. Last week, I was able to try ice cream from Bi-Rite Creamery and let me just say, it is about the best ice cream I've ever had (I say almost...because it's on par with Berthillon in Paris...not quite sure yet which one is better, but I'll let you know after I try both places a couple more times).  ;) I eventually settled on ginger...yummy deliciousness, and tasted the salted caramel, which is to die for. So worth any parking issues, additional efforts, and wait times.

I think the only flaw is how popular they are. The lines are ridiculously long, and often times wrap around the building to Dolores. I guess it's good business for ya! Stick one of their popsicle's in your mouth, trust me, it's worth the wait. Thanks so much Bi-Rite Creamery!!

Like wow. REALLY good ice cream. Sometimes I walk all the way to the Mission just to have it. Sure, sometimes there's a long line, but there's a reason why. The ice cream is amazing. You can't eat inside, but why would you want to when you can walk across the street and hang out in the best park in the city, Mission Dolores?

Good, good, good. Organic ice cream, excellent flavors (Riconelas, Roasted Banana). There is one sundae called, I believe, the Sam's Special and it has Organic Bergamot Olive Oil and Salt on it. This is a must-try, it is a very odd flavor combination, but very good. My favorite ice cream in the city, even over Mitchell's.

Overpriced, long wait, and while good enough, the ice cream isn't much better than other creameries, if at all. The hype is probably generated by the "innovative" flavors. Not impressed. And I can make better salted caramels.

Easily one of the best ice creams I've ever had. I got a triple-size. Crème fraîche, salted caramel, malted vanilla and mint chip. Awesome.  Just awesome.  Flavours weren't overpowering.  Ice cream wasn't too creamy.  Just right. And the line didn't take too long.  Plus $6 for all that ice cream seemed pretty good to me (only $8 for a pint).

You must try their ice cream! It's different. They serve you samples using real silver metal spoons, and the people who work here are friendly. I was surprised that they weren't getting annoyed of people asking them constantly to try a flavor since most of their flavors aren't common. I had the Salted Caramel and it was scrumptious!

Bi-Rite is good ice cream. Based on the two scoop single serving I got, one scoop was good and the other not so good. The bottom scoop was coffee toffee. It had good flavor and good toffee texture, but the ice cream texture was off. It was really soft and gritty and several times I crunched some ice. The top scoop was their famous Salted Caramel. It was very tasty and had much better texture. The wait was a bit of a scene but the three women working the counter made it move fast. Their service was great and they discounted my order because the Salted Caramel was scraped from the last bits of the pan. If the Coffee Toffee was spot on, I would totally give up four stars and I will be back.

Holy snaps! Ice cream is off the machine. It is the most perfect place to go when the sun is rarely out. It's nice to get a scoop or if you're big like me SCOOPS of ice cream and take a stroll around the area. I am a huge RICANELAS fan. Cinnamon snickerdoodles flavored ice cream? Genius. It's like Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs came and made my wish come true. Salty Caramel! Totally flavor town in your mouth. Get both of those together and you seriously might just die. Take a bite and knock out. Might as well bring a blanket. Prices are fair. Bomb ice cream deserves its money. Parking is tough since its the streets! If it is a really hot day, like REALLY hot and it's around a vacation time say the summer, then there is bound to be a loooooong line. That's why if you go bring your money so the wait is worth it. If you can't decide on what to get, ask for free samples! They do do that there. So take advantage of free tasting!

This place is amazing! The ice cream is pretty much the best you will ever have (ask anyone that's been there) and the forzen yogurt tastes perfect (as froyo should). The best part? It's organic, so it's infinity times better and more healthful! The ice cream is amazing, just try it. It tastes so much better than regular ice cream and there are all kinds of  flavors, one for every person. For the safe, there is vanilla. For the daring, there is salted caramel and honey lavender. The froyo is amazing as well, but it tastes more pure. Am I turning into a health freak?

Delicious! This is a sweet spot to go to after eating dinner in the area.  The only problem is the longgggggg lines and the lack of parking.  Otherwise, this place rocks. I tried the salted caramel ice cream, which everybody talks about on here.  It's really a unique flavor.  I love ice cream and dessert probably as much as anyone you'd know, but two scoops of salted caramel made me feel like I was going to get diabetes!  Not to say that it wasn't good, because it was.  The flavor was just really strong.  Given that I'm a masochist, the next time I go back there I'm definitely getting salted caramel again. I paired my salted caramel with this vanilla toffee crunch...I forget what it was called exactly, but that was delicious as well.  Not as strong of a flavor as salted caramel, but they went well together. I nibbled on my friend's earl grey and honey lavender.  The earl grey was good.  Obviously it reminded me of earl grey tea, but it was a unique flavor that I wouldn't mind having again.   The honey lavender, to me, tasted like massage oil.  Not that I've ever consumed massage oil, but that's the feeling I got after I had a bite of that. Despite my dislike for honey lavender, this place deserves 5 stars alone for the salted caramel.  I wish they had more than one bi-rite around the city!

I've got deep, deep love for Bi-Rite.  Man alive, that's some good stuff.  I usually opt for a classic sugar cone, but I've been known to splurge and go for the sundaes, getting the housemade graham crackers with roasted banana ice cream with caramel sauce and whipped cream.  It'll make your knees buckle.  It's that good.  I am not kidding.  The mint chip employs the freshest mint and tastes like no other mint chip you've ever tasted and the salted caramel is divine.  It's usually crazybusy, with a long line, but service is sweet and swift.  I enjoy grabbing a snack and strolling up to the top of Dolores Park, my most favorite spot in the City and sitting on one of those benches or lying on the grass and staring up at the sky.  THAT, my friends, is a little slice of heaven.  It doesn't get any better than that.

Whenever we go to San Francisco we generally stop by here on our way home. In my opinion Bi-Rite has the best ice cream in the Bay area. You get good portions for the price and the ice cream is so creamy and rich.  My favorite flavors are malted vanilla and salted caramel.  They have about 10-15 flavors that are unique and there is usually a line out the door with a 10-15 minute wait so be patient.  Trust me it's worth it.

This place is great, and I gotta give it props even though it does not have a lot of the more fruity flavors of ice cream that I normally go for.  The line out the door and around the corner pretty much speaks for itself, although it usually moves quickly.  It's hard to find a richer chocolate ice cream than this place.  There's the sundae option as well, but me, two scoops on a cone is just right.  Man, just writing this review makes me hungry for some Bi-Rite rite now...

The salted caramel blew my mind. Yes, it is a bit sweet, but there is no way I can criticize it for being too sweet. It is perfect the way it is!!! Flavors hit you in the face (or mouth) as soon as you take that first bite: creamy, slight burnt caramel, yummm. Seriously, after the first time I had the salted caramel, I thought and dreamed about it for the following weeks. Honey lavender tasted like a June wedding. Fragrant, creamy, and overall amazing. I love ice cream from this place so much, invested $40 bucks in pre-packed ice cream to bring home. Somewhat melting from the drive home from SF to Fremont, but I know it will be perfect again when I let it sit in the freezer for a couple of hours. Warning: Bi-Rite ice cream is extremely rich and creamy.  Consider this your splurge for the day. Unfortunately ice cream is my weakness, and Bi-Rite ice cream may just do me in someday.

The first time I went there I had Salted Caramel and Honey Lavender. And the second time was this past weekend.. I ordered the exact same thing..! Can't get enough of it! Ice cream is nice on a sunny day, but there's something about cold rainy day that makes ice cream sooo good!! (maybe because of shorter line) The line for Bi-Rite can be super long.. So have patience.. Tables inside are tiny.. Best to go sit in the park across the street or go for a stroll around the neighborhood.

I walked in the shop and he began handing me actual silverware teaspoons with tads of different flavors he scooped out for me...I chose two:  Ginger and Mega whatever coffee flavor.  Yummy.  Creamy.  Not quite as good as gelato but getting there.  I think it's even better than Mitchell's.

Came here on a weekday afternoon. No lines. Got the salted caramel, and the honey lavender. No need to review, since the thousand below me are all point. Insanely good. The guy behind the  counter was so cool. Almost wanted to ask him if he wanted to go have a drink somewhere. The only con is I don't think they have any sugar free ice cream, which sucks for all you insulin dependants. But I'll enjoy it for ya. I know, I suck.

Ice cream here is so wonderful!.  They have many unusual flavor yet so delicious.  We went there on a beautiful Saturday afternoon.   Not too crowded, the staff able to spend a lot of time us, letting us sampled multiple flavors: lavender, chai spice, balsamic strawbery, chocolate malt, ginger and...on....and...on.  We enjoyed them with glee. It was difficult to make the decision at the end, but we chose ginger  (since yelp raves about it) and my friend chose.......darn he forgot what he had, but it was damn good.  Our taste buds were happy for the rest of the day.

The Bi-Rite Creamery has sophisticated, unique, delicious ice cream. I especially love the salted caramel (rich, densely flavored, and not too sweet-- this is ice cream for grown ups). the crunchy coffee toffee, and the roasted banana. If anything, Bi Rite may be a little too creative, and there are occasional misses-- the honey lavender tasted kind of like eating a potpourri, and the strawberry balsamic was too oddball for me. But it's a special place. Between Tartine and Bi Rite, this is a dangerous block of the Mission for sweet tooths.

I can only add to the hype. Everything is yummy. The people who work there are friendly and encourage lots of sampling. Last time I was given a sample of lavender ice cream with olive oil and sea salt. Surprisingly delicious... but I ended up going with my old standby of one scoop cookies n' cream, one scoop banana.

I had the mint chip and the toasted coconut..I must tell you I suck at matching flavors..so of course the mint was overwelming refreshing! it took over the flavor the coconut.. but hey, that was great, too.. it  cute place..the workers nice..outside the store, they have benches that wrap around the trees..very cool.. definitely going back!

The long line here is worth the wait.  The salted caramel and Mexican chocolate with peanuts are my favorite flavors-smooth, dense, delicious ice cream.  The banana split has tender caramelized bananas that are roasted right before your very own eyes.  If you are in a rush go to Bi-Rite Market (other side of 18th heading towards Guerrero) and grab some ice cream goodies from the freezer case.  The popsicles and ice cream sandwiches are wicked awesome.

On those occasions I've managed to get in there, the ice cream has been generally quite good; I'm a particular fan of the vanilla malt. However, I have to ask: WTF, Mission dwellers? You're waiting in a line going all the way down the block for an ice cream cone - at 9:30 PM on a Wednesday? The line at this place has been completely insane for the past few months. I'd give it 4 stars if getting a cone here didn't invariably require waiting through approximately the entire duration of a midlife crisis. But hey, they're clearly getting by quite well (and will continue to) without a more favorable rating from me anyway.

Small ice cream shop with excellent American style ice cream, high in butterfat. This is not gelato. They have interesting flavors like salt caramel and honey lavender. Sam's Special is chocolate ice cream, whipped cream, bergamot-infused olive oil, and salt. While it sounds awful, it's great. There are only a few seats inside: be prepared to sit outside on one of several benches or walk across the street to Dolores Park. If you are in SF, well worth a trip

I freely admit I'm a member of the "this is the best ice cream you can get in san francisco" club.  I evangelize the joys of the bi-rite to my friends and visitors.  It is easily accessible after getting off the J-Church, you can hit up Bi-Rite and Tartine in one afternoon :)  I find that the staff are very understanding when children drop their ice cream samples and are patient when you want to try a few flavors or more before making a decision.  My most recent favorite is the coffee toffee.  It sounds basic but the coffee flavor is clear and the toffee is both crunchy and gooey!  The small lets you have 2 flavors.  Even the popsicles are really good if you are lactose intolerant. They taste very fresh! I've skipped dessert at restaurants during winter to run over to Bi-Rite before it closes and I've enjoyed it during the summer after watching the SF Mime Troupe on Delores Park.  This place is great year round!

Oh and if you're buying a pint or a ice cream sandwich, you can bypass the line!  Just go grab it and go to pay!

Hello salted-caramel ice cream!  I am actually a little lactose intolerant, but I will eat salted-caramel ice cream thousand times.  Sweet and rich caramel flavor mixed with a hint of salt in a creamy ice cream form is a combination that will make your taste buds go wild.  For those of you who don't want to wait in line forever, there is a shorter line couple feet down the street where you can order from this window (Beware: the selections are limited).

Bi-Rite Creamery reminds me of Molly Moon's in Seattle. Both trumpet the fact that they use quality local organic ingredients. Both are also very good. I got the salted caramel and roasted banana at Bi-Rite and it tasted exceptional. I still prefer gelato but if I had a craving for ice cream and I was in the area, I would head straight for Bi-Rite Creamery. Next time I want to try their soft serve.

I love this place, and apparently so does everyone else in San Francisco because every time I come here there is a line out the door and around the corner. The first few times I got the roasted banana ice cream.. sooo good (I have some obsession with bananas in desserts). They have specials that have infused olive oil drizzled over vanilla ice cream, sounded intriguing so I gave it a try. Mine had blood-orange infused olive oil, and it was so great. Point is.. I have never been disappointed by Bi-rite, and neither has anyone I've brought here.

Their ice cream is really good. Possibly some of the best ice cream I've ever had. But, it's also the type of ice cream where it's good only once or twice a week. Over do it, and you'll get sick of it. But, have it in moderation and you'll keep coming back for more. Lastly, I like the ginger flavor ice cream and their cantaloupe popsicle is too icy.

When I go to Bi-Rite. I love the unique pairings of savory and sweet flavored ice creams with little chopped pieces of whatever they are. Top flavors:   Toasted Coconut   Coffee Toffee   Salted Caramel, a really nice savory butterscotchy flavor.   Roasted Banana It's right by Dolores Park, so on a hot sunny day it's great to enjoy your ice cream after your wait in the line, even though it may wrap around the corner sometimes. After dinner dessert, even on a cold-ish night the line shows that the wait is deserved. Haven't tried yet, but I hear good things:   Ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles)

bad day at work today. gonna take it out on the hapless BiRite Creamery. I remember when I first heard of a gift registry for weddings, and I almost couldn't believe such a thing existed. Or the first time I saw someone eat sushi with a knife and fork, I simply could not continue my meal and politely excused myself. Or perhaps my first encounter with classic nouveau American Suburbanism, replete with the white carpets and the electric fountains and the too-large houses on too-small lots. Here we have the ice-cream equivalent of the offenses enumerated above. Its bad enough this place so wantonly flaunts its association with Bi-Rite Grocery, one of the most ridiculously over-priced bouzhie Mission grocery stores that has ever existed. ($5/ pound tomatoes?!) But the real crime here is how SWEET the ice cream here is. That's right, sweet.  Saccharine, cloying, catches-in-your-throat, mawkish sentimentality that has to be tasted to be believed. Sure, the names of the flavors are interesting. Honey-Lavender, or perhaps the Salted Caramel may catch your eye.  (BTW, sugar and salt do not affect the taste of food in opposite ways! Sugar is an organic molecule, brutish and monochromatic with flavor. Salt, applied well, is far more subtle, enhancing some flavors, adumbrating others) I imagined the salted caramel to taste outer-worldly, subterranean. I thought maybe it would be akin to eating pure mineral matter. Perhaps I would know again and again the rare joy of the taste of mistaken expectations---like when you reach for your water glass and get the wine instead, and for that magical moment you taste, truly taste with no preconceptions whatsoever. The problem is that this moment only occurs when it is unexpected, so its a little hard to experience it consistently. (Now that I think about it, I guess you could blind-fold yourself and have your sig-fig feed you mystery foods a la 9.5 Weeks, but that might not be for everyone. Anyway). The honey-lavender was a joke, so sugary the delicate lavender oil barely registered. Don't get me started on the chai spice milk or the balsamic strawberry. Am I being too picky? I notice this place is always packed with a line outside the door. The reviews are almost uniformly positive. Maybe I am the one who is wrong, and don't understand this folksy, good-natured approach to desert. Doesn't matter. I'll stand with my bad taste in ice-cream..

yes, the ice cream at bi-rite creamery is pretty good, but it's not that great. it's just ice cream. taste-tested the chai-spiced milk chocolate, but passed on it since it the flavor was too over-the-top. salted caramel was good. classics like mint chip, chocolate and banana would be good choices as well. what stood out to me the most though, was the adult-to-child ratio at this ice cream shop: 15:1.

Although we were not hungry at all, we went to split a couple of scoops of ice cream down the street at Bi-Rite Creamery. Again, another line down the street. We waited and got a scoop of their salted caramel, and a scoop of their toffee coffee. Both were super yummy. The salted caramel was a little too sweet for me, but the salt was delicious in it, and the toffee coffee was two of my favorite things put together in an ice cream. Even though I was super full, I definitely stuffed that whole thing in my tummy and it was very very very very good. They allow you to get a cone with 2 scoops in it. You can choose both of the same type of ice cream, or 2 different flavors, but be careful because they are very prone to falling off the top. We witnessed an entire scoop falling off the top inside the store, before the guy even paid. Luckily for him they are very kind and replaced the scoop no problem :)

The ice cream was okay. Not as good as nearby Bombay Ice Creamery. But the reason I give this place one star is because of all the yuppies who frequent it. We're in the Mission right? For some reason Marina people think they can take over this street: with Delfina, Bi-Rite and Tartine. I say no thanks mofos. When I was at Bi-Rite last time there was some dude with his two little kids. I swear what a bunch of spoiled a-holes. Just be happy that your dad is buying you over-priced ice cream. Just go back to your mommy waiting in the Mercedes double parked outside. Yeah, if I wanted West LA I'd live in LA assholes. Stay outta the Mission please. Stick to Bombay....

why is it that people who maintain a vegan diet assume that just because something is vegan that it tastes good? bi-rite, unfortunately, falls into this category. if i were someone who consumed dairy products, i'm certain i would rant and rave about the awesomeness of this joint. i mean the design of the place is sweet, the flavor selection looks nice and even the sundaes look cool, but the real proof is in the pudding...er... ice cream. unfortunately the first lick did not send me into vegan frozen treat heaven but rather returned me to the dark days of the early 90s eating moca mix or rice dream--complete with nasty aftertaste. they get two stars, mostly for effort. back to the drawing board bi-rite folx. i'm sticking with maggie mudds.

with places like fenton's and ici under my belt, it was time for bi-rite. lucky for me, it was close to where i was staying. i tried pretty much all the flavors but only malted vanilla w/ peanut brittle and chocolate truly stood out to me. salted caramel, earl gray, brown sugar were good but i didn't crave it. the ice cream here is much more intricate and sophisticated than fenton's but i still love ici's waffle cones. definitely a must stop for ice cream fans but it just lacked that extra oomph for me. must try humphrey slowcombe for more comparison as well.

it's ice cream season!!  time for my second chin to make a comeback, with the assistance of bi-rite creamery. on cold WINTER nights, the lines for bi-rite don't fail to spill out the door. on warm sunny SPRING days, the line goes up the street and around the block..... ahh who am i kidding?  it's always ice cream season!!! bi-rite's ice cream is incredibly CREAMY and RICH.  their flavors are unique but not too crazy.  you can have 2 flavors in a the single scoop, which i would SELL MY SOUL for.... but bi-rite only charges 3.25. the CINNAMON/SNICKERDOODLE has chunks of real snickerdoodles it it and is excellent!  it replaced the BROWN SUGAR GINGER W/ CARAMEL SWIRL, which i also loved (the name is self-explanatory.)  the ORANGE CARDAMON was very refreshingly fruity yet spicy... it was interesting and the flavor grew on me with each lick.  the VANILLA MALT was quite malty... a bit too malty for me, but enjoyable nonetheless.  the COFFEE BEER was also overly beery for my taste.... but the COFFEE TOFFEE is to die for!! chunks of toffee in strong coffee ice cream.....mmmmmmmm!  the GINGER ice cream was spicy, i would like it more if it were sweeter.  my friends all loved ROASTED BANANA, however i don't go near the stuff cause i don't like bananas... cutting to the chase... my ALL-TIME FAVORITE is still SALTED CARAMEL.  its sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo delicious i want to marry it and eat it forever. the end.

I was hoping to find some vegan ice cream in San Francisco and Bi-Rite did not disappoint! I got a brownie sundae made with their vegan chocolate coconut ice cream (the whole sundae wasn't vegan, though). The ice cream itself was awesome. It doesn't taste too much like coconut but it's very creamy like dairy ice cream. The brownie was homemade and they put spiced toasted pecans on that are amazing. The sundae was $7 but it was worth it for a sundae made with vegan ice cream! It also seems like they have good values in terms of using whole/natural ingredients and that's worth supporting, too. The staff were awesome as well.

Sunday afternoon with no plans called for a impromptu day around SF for myself and a couple of buds. The line was small and moved at a good pace, so we were inside in only a few minutes. Salted Caramel and Roasted Banana were my  choices, although I asked to sample the Balsamic Strawberry before placing my order. I plowed through the cone and two scoops of ice cream in no time flat, which left me extremely tempted to fall back in the still surprisingly short line and grab another one. Salted Caramel had a good balance of sweet and savory. My friend thought it was nasty. Are you serious, woman?! I suppose it's an acquired taste for some, but most will agree that it's pretty damn good. That with Roasted Banana made for probably the best ice cream combo I ever had. No joke. Now that I think about it, the two flavors remind me of Bananas Foster, sans the need for a stove. This place is legit, so I'm putting 5 (stars) on it.

A gorgeous day in San Francisco is pretty hard to come by so it makes a great day for ice cream!  Yesterday we waited in the long line for some bi-rite.  Note to self - next visit just go straight to soft serve to get salted caramel because there are only 4 people in line at the most.  Luckily this line didn't wrap around the block when we arrived but there was zero parking because everyone and their mama was at the Dolores Park! I tried the cookies n cream (I've had better), honey lavender (my favorite - really strong lavender flavor I felt like I was eating my lavender oil at home), and roasted banana (Mmmm so damn good).  I got a little sample of salted caramel, the depth of that flavor for a tiny little sample was crazy.   You can also purchase cookies, cakes, and their prepackaged ice cream if you don't want to wait in line.  At the time they had Mexican Chocolate prepackaged.  The best part about this place is that they have frequent buyer cards. Gotta love that!

You'd think savory ice cream is weird, but this place makes it work.  Flavors like salted caramel, honey lavender, olive oil, balsamic strawberry, roasted banana--all strange, but Bi-Rite has got it down.  Usually we were told the line is insane and out the door, but because we came on a rainy Monday night, we thankfully only waited 5 min.  Per a request from our friend, we knew we'd be getting the salted caramel pint to go.  We sampled the balsamic strawberry which was a burst of tart berries in our mouths but opted for the stranger honey lavender which was mildly sweet and just tasted clean and girly, if an ice cream can taste girly.  Amazing.  The texture of the honey lavender was dense and creamy while the salted caramel was fluffier.  I prefer the denser ice cream.  Also liked the other flavors more than salted caramel--I'm just not a fan of caramel (too sweet).  At $7 a pint, it's no cheap treat, but still a cheaper option than buying it by the scoop.  I just wish we were here and had more time to try every single flavor.

Overpriced and so mediocre. We wouldn't have an issue spending the money, but it just wasn't that good. The pint was so light---read not much butterfat and mostly air--and tasted as such. The flavor was good of the salted caramel but still it was not particularly creamy. The toffee was icy and tasted more like a snow cone than ice cream. Hands down I prefer Mitchell's. I left very disappointed. Sorry to all you 4 and 5 star folks.

We suggested going somewhere else to her but we could tell in her tone of voice that she was really set on Bi-Rite...I was thinking....no ice cream is worth a 30 minute wait in the cold! She said hey...let me go down and see if I can buy a few pints....luckily there wasnt a wait to buy pints and she came back with three pints one for each of us LOL..we parked right there in someone drive way and  dug in. Rocky Road, Mint Chip, and Salted Carmel!

Let me just say this, hands down the best ice cream I've had in quite some time. The reason for only four stars? The hoops you have to jump through to get a scoop. You know, sometimes the hoops aren't worth the scoops. Point being, I'm the type of person who generally knows what he wants and if I don't, I usually deal with what I get. It seems that a lot of people out there want to sample every flavor of ice cream in the case before they settle on their old stand-by. This can take up a vast portion of an hour, when you are the last in line and the brats in front of you want to lick every !@#$% spoon in the joint. Sorry, I just had to get that out of my system. Anyway, if you have the patience or great timing, then by all means go for it. The concoctions are fantastically avant-guarde and I have not had a flavor that I did not enjoy. I especially like the Sam's Sundae. This creation has bergamot infused olive oil, drizzled over dark chocolate ice cream, with a sprinkling of flaked sea salt and of course topped with homemade whipped creme. I'm salivating just thinking about it...I gotta go jump throug a hoop...I guess I'll be standing in line for some ice cream.

When i first saw Sam's Sundae from Bi Rite featured on Best Thing I Ever Ate, i was literally drooling. I was expecting to wait in line, i literally walked in and ordered my ice cream, done.   I knew i was only going to have one opportunity to visit Bi Rite, so Sam's Sundae was too risky, what if i didnt like chocolate and olive oil and salt, so i opted for the safe choice.  I ordered a small for $3.25 which allows you to try two flavours.  I know the salted caramel thing is pretty mainstream, but it had that slightly burnt taste i love, but i dint get any saltiness.  I also had the Malted vanilla with peanut brittle and chocolate pieces, this one didnt do much for me, it was just ok.  my sis had the cookies and cream, paired with the vanilla.  She loved both of them.  I have to give the scoopers at bi rite  major props, because they scoop the ice cream perfectly, it is in a tight, clean ball.  Also there was a celebrity sighting, Jay one of the finale contestants in last season of Project Runway.

In all seriousness their ice cream is by far the best I ever had. All the flavors taste exactly like what they are! I love this place, but finding parking sucks, try going in the afternoon to avoid long lines! But it is worth the wait and the line moves fast anyways. Oh!

I went here with some friends and the serving size was incredibly small, so after the first serving we went back to get more. Well the staff is just incredibly delusional! My two friends and I all tried this ice cream that they called "salted caramel" which it clearly wasn't. Each of us ordered the salted caramel on our first time in the store so we knew they'd gotten either all our orders wrong the first time or this time. This flavor was so disgusting I literally threw up in the park across the street. We went back to tell them their mistake, oh and after I'd given them a $5 tip the first time, and the lady at the counter was like "oh no I know all the flavors and what they look like and that is salted caramel. You're wrong." After her trying to convince me that I'm wrong for 5 minutes I simply turn my back to her and walk out. I figured the best I could do was give this place an awful review to the best of my abilities and give the FDA a call to about their clearly disastrous organizational abilities. I'm allergic to chocolate and easily I could have had a horrible reaction if they'd screwed up my order any worse. Well the FDA hasn't gotten back to me about what their exact results were, but they did notice something awfully screwy that they've decided to investigate further.

I've heard about this place for a long time as it vies with Humphry Slocombe to become to top ice creamery in San Francisco. I declare a winner! It was quite strange waiting in line for ice cream on a hot sunny Saturday afternoon in late November in the city, but I was excited to try the delicious handcrafted flavors. I tried several different flavors before settling on toffee coffee and toasted coconut. I felt the salted caramel was too sweet and the honey lavender was too fragrant. Toffee coffee and toasted coconut was the perfect combination. It's probably some of the best coffee ice cream I've ever had. The ice cream flavors were bold where they needed to be and subtle in other instances. Needless to say, the ice cream disappeared pretty quickly. I guess going along with the sustainability movement, they now have sustainable ice cream. I suppose that's a good thing. As long as they keep churning out delicious dessert!

4 words.. Salted Carmel Ice Cream!!!! it's one of those ice creams you can't stop eating! my co worker brought a tub back in the office and we all had our first taste..and from that point on, none of us wanted to share it and we made it a monthly habit to make sure our fridge was stock up with it.  it wasn't too sweet nor was it too salty i don't know how to describe the taste... you need to try it if you haven't! i wished they sold it in the supermarkets!

The ice cream is interesting, for lack of a better word. I got the salted caramel. Maybe two scoops of that was too much. It was extremely salty, in a good way. :) The service was great. My friend and I sampled pretty much everything they had. The line is really long and parking can be a challenge, but its a cool experience. Must try!

haha, i see my friend vera d. shares my sentiments exactly! i had the caramel swirl, which was delicious, but ici in the east bay elicited a greater emotional response from me. i was surprised upon visiting bi-rite that it was less charming, more churn & burn, than ici. i guess because they're super busy, but ici always has a line out the door & down the block, too. in the city, i guess i still prefer joe's (even over mitchell's) or will get fro-yo (healthy!).

(yes i've TRIED them - they don't wow me.) if you just want a unique flavor, go here. otherwise, i'd rather go to swensen's or mitchell's. it's not worth it to come down here for a flavor you don't have dirty fantasies about. cuz even though parking sucks at swensen's and mitchell's at least the black mtn raspberry/mango WILL wow you.

I haven't actually been here but my friend brought me a carton of the salty caramel flavor ice cream. I gotta say, it's definitely among the more unique ice creams I've ever had. The texture is incredibly smooth, almost like butter. The flavor is pretty good, although a bit subdued and with a bit too strong aftertaste. Too bad I don't live in San Francisco otherwise I'd like to come here myself one time.

Despite many visits to SFO, I had never heard of Bi-Rite Creamery before a friend brought it to my attention. My daughter and I loved it so much that we made a point of visiting twice during our brief vacation. We both loved the salted caramel. She also got brown sugar both times, and I got Ginger and Malted Vanilla. If only we could have brought some of it home with us... {sigh}

I've been here a couple of times but I always chose the original flavors like chocolate or mint ship. However, I finally decided to try their salty caramel flavor and Sam's sundae. Usually, when I go there, there isn't a line so when my friend and I walked toward the creamery, I literally shat my pants to see a line reach to the corner of the street. The wait wasn't that long though and when I finally got a chance to place my order, I ordered a single sized cup with balsamic  strawberry and salted caramel. After the worker gave me single sized cup, I asked for a Sam's sundae as well which surprised her because I'm guessing people usually don't order a sundae as well as two flavors of ice cream. First up, I ate the salted caramel which I really enjoyed. It was pretty sweet which can be a turn-off for some people, but it was a total turn-on for me. I also loved the balsamic strawberry with small chunks of strawberry and a subtle presence of balsamic vinegar. Sam's sundae was...interesting. I saw this treat on the food network channel so I decided to give it a go. The first thing I tasted was the salt, which was off-putting. Then the olive oil hit my taste buds like a sucker punch and the chocolate brought the sweetness that I was craving for. This mixture of salty and sweet wasn't the best thing that I've ever eaten but I ate the majority of it. Even though I didn't really care for the sundae, I really enjoyed the balsamic strawberry and salted caramel flavors. This is my favorite ice cream place and every time I come here, I leave happy.

Tasty ice cream and a really cute store with an eco-friendly vibe. After reading yelp reviews, I had to taste the salted caramel and roasted banana. The former's caramel flavor was really in-your-face strong and concentrated sweetness. It's amazing how they infuse such specific flavors into their ice cream. The coffee toffee tastes like you're drinking coffee! Furthermore, the different textures of the different flavors suggest that they aren't just products of various combos of artificial flavorings--they actually contain the foods that they are based on. For example, the roasted banana was much denser than the other flavors I tried; plus, the bananas hanging in the kitchen area verified that they really make their ice cream authentically. The really friendly saleslady suggested a combo of roasted banana and brown sugar, to which I happily agreed. A "single" serving, which can be two flavors/scoops, amounts to ~$3. We came at around noon on Saturday and surprisingly there was no line, although more people started coming in as we sat inside and ate so we probably beat the rush. I'm lactose intolerant, but did not feel sick after eating their ice cream. Minus one star for being expensive, but I would stop by again if I ever find myself in the area.

Been eating way more ice cream than I usually do and the reason for that is Bi-Rite Creamery. I just started going to this place about a month ago and I'm addicted. This place has the best ice cream I have ever had in my life and I've tried a lot. I love the texture of the ice cream its almost like a gelato soft melt in your mouth texture. There are so many flavors that are good it all depends on what your in the mood for. My personal favorite is the coffee toffey, salted caramel, and mint chip. Sometimes if I feel like a fruity taste I would get the concord grape popsicle. This place actually reminds me of Milk Creamery in So Cal, but this place out perfects them. The service here is very friendly and the location is great (right across from Dolores Park). Price is very reasonable and the scoops they give you are generous. I give this place 5 stars because I don't know if ice cream can taste any better than this, by far the best ice cream I have ever tried. No wonder I'm addicted.

It's probably hyperbolic to call ice cream "life changing," but that's how I describe Bi-Rite to other tourists. I don't look at ice cream the same after coming here because I didn't know it could be this good. If there is better ice cream on the planet, someone will have to prove it to me. So many people recommended it to me on my last trip to San Francisco that I didn't believe it could live up to the hype, but it far exceeded all my expectations. I don't think you can go wrong with any flavor. The salted caramel is the one people talk about, and it's great, but the rest are just as good. I think the apple pie has entire, baked, apple pies crumbled into it. Some day I hope to come back to try one of the sundaes (chocolate with olive oil and sea salt is first on my list). The worst I can say about it is that there can be an absurdly long line, even on a cold night, but that seems to be par for the course in this hipster gourmet part of SF, and it's worth the wait at Bi-Rite.

I finally decided to fall into the line after convincing myself that the line would never be shorter. It wasn't too chilly outside, so I didn't mind very much. Anyway, I'm so thankful for the handheld menu that floats around the beginning of the line because as a very indecisive individual, I do not want to be responsible for holding up the line. I tried the Salted Caramel and the Malted Vanilla with Peanut Brittle and Milk Chocolate Pieces. Surprisingly, I did not like the Salted Caramel, at all. I am a HUGE caramel lover but this flavor was way too strong for me because of the weird aftertaste. I'm not sure what it was but it was nasty. On the flip side, I enjoyed the other flavor a lot. I like to have texture in my ice cream to keep it exciting. haha But really, this flavor was super delicious. The prices aren't bad at all because I got two scoops on a cone for $3.25 (I think) and I was happy. All was well.

My friends hyped this place up a lot for me, so when I stood in the long line and finally got to have a bite, it was alright. Not as amazing as I was told it was. They have unique flavors. I had the salted caramel(?) which was very interesting - something I would get sick of after eating half of it though. Malted Vanilla was pretty good though.

there isnt a lot i can say about this place that hasn't been said before.  there are i think about 600 reviews.  yelp did not disapoint once again.  the thing that separates bi rite creamery from other places is that 1 they make their own ice cream and 2 the flavors are unique and phenomenal. If you like caramel then you have to try the salted caramel.  the mint chip was really good but my scoop had too many chocolate pieces in it  i 'm sure the whole batch was not like that;  i also loved the bold coffee flavor of the coffee toffee ice cream while the vanilla ice cream could have had a little stronger vanilla flavor but it was very tasty as it was.  the next time i go i'll buy a couple pints to go,   Viva La Ice Cream!

i can't deny that the decor is absolutely adorable, but in my opinion the ice cream lacked a certain creamy quality and the pricing in somewhat prohibitive. that being said,  the flavors were incredible (try the salted caramel). the stand out item was the blood orange granita. though if it hadn't been 40 degrees outside i would have enjoyed it a bit more.

Without exaggeration, this is The Best Ice Cream In The World.  I'm frugal, and I think it costs about $8 pint, and let me tell you, it's worth every penny.  It's difficult to describe why it's so good... creamy without being heavy, unusual flavors (ginger, creme fraiche), and homemade toppings.  I recommend the butter pecan ice cream with toffee topping.  Miraculously, eating their ice cream does not result in a sugar crash later on.

I am drooling just thinking about "Sam's Sundae" and the "Afternoon Snack". I will wait in line for days if I had to!! Okay, maybe an hour or two at the most, but really, Bi Rite has got the best sundaes and best ice cream in town! The lines are longer than the most popular club in the city, but who cares because you leave here with the most mouth watering, delicious ice cream creation and big goofy smile on your face! Despite the long line, the laid back staff will STILL ask if you want to sample a flavor...don't be shy!!! Sam's Sundae is my favorite of all time (chocolate ice cream with bergamot olive oil, whip cream and a sprinkle of maldon sea salt) but the roasted banana, plain chocolate, and toasted coconut are among my favorites!)...God I wish I lived closer so I could have dessert here every single day of the week.

Don't know what was wrong with my GPS, but I had the hardest time finding this place.  For a while, I became convinced that Bi-Rite Creamery was located inside of the Bi-Rite market since they share the same street.  Then I looked for a "Creamery" inside and only found a freezer full of Bi-Rite ice cream.  I was a little disappointed but assumed this was what everyone was raving about.  Disappointed, but I was gonna try this ice cream of theirs.  I went to the counter with my little canister of Bi-Rite ice cream.  I even asked the lady checking me out, if the freezer was all that they had of the ice cream (which I actually meant to mean "Is this all the flavors your Creamery served?").  She said yeah.  So I was disappointed again.  Hesitantly, I walked away with my canister in a paper bag.  5 steps outside, I just thought something was not right.  Gathered up the guts, walked back in, and asked "Is this Bi-Rite Creamery?"  The cashier finally let me in on the secret that it was down the street.  And he was even nice enough to refund me the money for my pre-packaged Bi-Rite ice cream so that I can walk down the street to get the fresh Bi-Rite ice cream.  Which I did.  And it made my day!

My favorite ice cream in the city. Mitchells is a close second, but Bi-rite is closer to my neighborhood and I walk by it weekly. Yes it is pricey, so I only go in once every couple of months. My desire for their wonderful ice cream goes up and up, until my resolve breaks and I go in. I usually wait until I'm passing when there is no line. And really there are many times through the week when there isn't the long line out the door. I always find that the staff is friendly and helpful. Usually they talk and joke with us. I like the compostable plastic spoons, I abhor the flat wooden spoons--they give me that fingernail on chalkboard feeling, so I have to remember to ask for the special spoons and not call them plastic or I get the compostable lecture. My current favorite flavors are Earl Grey , Lavender Honey, and Ginger. I've never been a fan of the salted caramel, but come and try the flavors out, there's bound to be something for you.

I finally got to try Bi-Rite Creamery after hearing about it from multiple people. I love ice cream and wondered what the hype was all about.  The line was out the door but went quickly.  I decided to try the salted caramel and it was to die for.  It wasn't too overwhelming or too sweet but definitely rich with caramel flavor.  My bf decided to get coffee with toffee (i forget what they call it exactly) and he loved it as well.  Will definitely go back. Parking can get quite bad which is why I gave it 4 stars. Luckily we went on a week night and it wasn't too bad.  They are also pretty generous with the amount. They give you two scoops for the single and if you want you can get 1-2 flavors with the single.

I LOVE their salted caramel ice cream! I came here with a co-worker after work on a hot day in San Francisco.  The weather was rare because San Francisco generally does not get very hot.  However, the temperature was in the 80s.  When we came here, there was a long time. We expected it because this place was highly rated and it was so hot.  My co-worker came here before and recommended that I get the salted caramel because she says it's not your usual ice cream from Safeway or other drug stores.  I heeded to her advice and got it. Boy was I surprised!!! The salted caramel was salty, sweet, and creamy. It absolutely melted in my mouth like butter.  It's soooo delicious that I wished I bought a tub home for my fiancee to try.  I got my ice-cream in a cone and I gobbled it up in less than 5 minutes.  If you ever come here, you need to try their salted caramel flavor.  I will definitely come back for their ice-cream!

creme fraiche ice cream?!  only at bi-rite.  a "single" is actually 2 scoops of ice cream, so get some different combos.  try some of these on for size:  chocolate + coffee toffee (bittersweet chocolate contrasts nicely with the sweet and crunchy toffee), lemon + honey lavender (tart and floral), and  creme fraiche + balsamic strawberry (decadent and refreshing...it's like summertime splooged in my mouth).

I'm glad I never heard any of the hype because I definitely would've been disappointed. This place has unique flavors, but none of them were too appealing to me. I love that you can ask for samples of any flavor and the workers never give you a look like "are you gunna buy something or are you just going to sample every damn flavor?" Went here yesterday and had the balsamic strawberry and honey lavender. Balsamic strawberry wasn't bad. Just a less sweet version of strawberry ice cream. The honey lavender though....TASTED LIKE SOAP! My husband loved it..but he likes weird things like snake and alligator sooooo yeah. His breath definitely smelled like soap the rest of the day. Our friends had other flavors, which I sampled, but none WOWed me. Good job Bi-Rite for having unconventional flavors, but sorry, you fail in making them yummy and worth driving out to the city and taking 30 minutes to find parking for.

Yummy ice cream, but overhyped to the point of being disappointing. I was expecting a dense ice cream, and this is very fluffy and air-filled. I got salted caramel and it was soft and melting. I ended up drinking the last quarter of it. I also tried my friend's sundae. I loved the heavy cream and the homemade graham cracker and caramel topping. So yummy, but quickly became sickeningly sweet. I think this place is good, but not great, and a bit pricey for what you get.

Jeez folks, how come it took my whole life to find people who love ice cream as much as I do?  God created ice cream to be loved, to be created, conceived of, dreamed about in the same manner he invented angels and heaven, absolute joy.  When I first started hearing about Bi-Rite, I thought, just what we need, another run of the mill http://dot.com refugee with too much money and time on his/her hands and a shallow faculty of delivering more than expensive, organic ingredients.  I then read reviews that talked about flavors that sounded atrocious so I had to go check them out, and I was delivered where to the promised land.  My first lick of balsamic strawberry confused my taste buds, but I wanted more, the way a crack whore wants more, and then there were other mystical, adventurous flavors I'll leave for you to explore and fall in love, hate or indifference with.  Sundaes, cones, scoops, brownies, cookies, toppings and long lines make Bi-Rite the newest San Francisco treat and tradition, DO NOT DEPRIVE YOURSELF.

Everyone loves ice cream.  And everyone loves Bi-Rite.  I went with a few friends after reading all of the reviews.  I sampled the salted caramel after all of the rave reviews and liked it but didn't love it.  As some have said, it tasted a bit burnt.  The chocolate coconut was ok but not outstanding, and the ricanelas was good but didn't blow me away.  I had the toasted coconut, which was tasty.  The real winner of the day though was the roasted banana.  The Mexican chocolate soft serve that we sampled on the way back was also deeeeelicious.  Bonus points to the staff for being courteous and fun.  They helped me goad a friend into buying ice cream when she said she was "stuffed from dinner" (who needs to be goaded into eating ice cream, really?) and gave me a frequent buyer card after the fact when I realized that we hadn't gotten one when we bought our ice cream.

although not quite as imaginative or diverse with their flavors as humphrey slocombe, this place holds it's own with some savory creations of their own.  the honey lavender tasted like the smell of soap, or like a spa.  the ricanelas was ok...it could have used more cinammon.  the creme fraiche doesn't really taste like anything.  the brown sugar with ginger caramel swirl could have used more of both.  i finally settled on the salted caramel and roasted banana.  it was a great combo, like a foster's banana!  the salted caramel had just enough of a hint of salt to bring out the lusciousness of the caramel, and the roasted banana tasted like, well, roasted banana!  yum :D

4 words: salted caramel/honey lavender. these are my flavors of choice, and when i go back to san francisco for a visit home, i got to revel in those flavors not one, BUT two nights! on both nights the line was ridiculous, curving around the corner into dolores street. and if i didn't have my girlfriends there to chat with i would've felt pathetic for waiting in such long a line for ice cream... but it was WORTH IT! i try different flavors but i keep going back for the honey lavender/salted caramel combo! it's TOO GOOD!

i don't know why, but i first thought bi-rite was suppose to be some kind of hole in the wall ice cream shoppe. like swensen's or something. but surprise surprise! it was kind of pretty looking. kind of fancy for an ice cream shop. so many crazy flavors i've never seen in my life! ok, maybe it's not crazy, but definitely unique. balsamic strawberry? roasted banana. i got the salted caramel with the honey lavender. honey lavender was pretty good and the salted caramel was delicious, but then it started getting too salty in the end. kind of expensive for the tiny two scoops they give you but i guess they have the right since you can't get these flavors anywhere else. would i come back? yes! must try the other cool flavors!

Reasonably priced for such unique ice cream. At first I thought it wasn't going to be anything too special because ice cream doesn't excite me. There were a lot of flavors to chose from and the two people working there were pretty friendly.  I opted for 2 scoops on a sugar cone - had the toffee coffee and the salted Carmel. I loved the sweet and savory of the salted Carmel!  I have to admit that this is not my first encounter with this combination but it worked very well as an ice cream. At first you may think the sweet would be weird with the salt but it is totally perfect.   I enjoyed this flavor over the coffee toffee that was good but the salted Carmel outshines it. Someone with us got the strawberry vinaigrette, which was good too but not too special. It kind of just reminded me of salad dressing.  I'm not sure I'm in love with the consistency and the level of creaminess but the flavors were worth the visit. I would stop in herd to check out new flavors or get the salted Carmel again.

Came here for some dessert after dinner. Saw a long line at the door..and it was almost 10pm. So I thought "This place has to be good!!" Line went pretty quick. Tried the salty caramel and roasted banana with some roasted almonds, it was delicious!! Love love love the roasted banana... the roasted caramel was good, definitely has a salty touch to it...and you can really taste the caramel flavor. The roasted almonds were actually warm which was a nice touch to the cold ice cream. Liked that the almonds came in nice chunks! Cause I love chewing stuff with my ice cream...=)! Would like to come back and try more flavors if I was around the area or at Dolores park cause it's right across the street. Menu looks like it had a few funky flavors I would like to try. And these are home made, will need to come back and try more flavors to see if it deserves more stars...too bad this is in SF, parking sucks so accessibility for me is not that great.

on a rainy, gloomy day, us east coasters braved the freezing cold weather to get the famous bi-rite ice cream.  initially we walked into the bi-rite grocery store (which is gorgeous but NOT the creamery) and then finally found our way down the street to get soft serve of the day and a rich hot chocolate.  the salted caramel soft serve was exquisite and affordable and the hot chocolate machine didn't have enough so they charged me less. ice cream to grab and go, skip a long line, and walk around SF with on a fall day? ill take it.  it appears that soft serve flavors change daily. super fun.

When I lived in the Mission, I used to go to Bi-Rite Market on a regular basis and would see signs about the Creamery opening soon, and I would wait and dream. Of course, as soon as I moved away, this placed opened up. Typical. Now I live in Southern California and have nothing comparable down here!! Since it opened, I have been probably 10 times to this place and it has yet to disappoint me. Sure, there's always a long line, and like this past Saturday night, parking was a bitch and it was freezing outside; it is still worth all of this. This place may not have all of the flavors that Mitchell's has, but they are brilliant at the classics, vanilla and chocolate. This past time, I got the build your own sundae with one scoop of vanilla and one scoop of roasted banana (the most incredible flavor ever!), brownie bite, hot fudge, and whipped cream. This was the best sundae I have ever had in my life, hands down. I love you Bi-Rite Creamery!!!

They have some interesting flavors one has to try at least once, such as "salted caramel!   Who thinks of such concoctions!  The staff is super nice and will let you try a lot of flavors, because making up your mind can be harder than a test question that makes you bitterly ask "who wrote this damn question!"  Oh, so many choices and  they all look so good.  I would give it five stars, if the ice cream and packed pints were not so pricey, but you get what you pay for.

i REALLY REALLY L-O-V-E brownie sundaes and when i walked into this place i was super excited to see it on their menu! maybe it was the time of night or maybe that's just the way it always is, but that was one stale and nasty brownie at the bottom of my sundae :[ the spiced pecans and caramel and fudge toppings were the best part. the sundae came with two scoops of my favourite flavor: vanilla! and i gotta say that their vanilla is only OK plus it was kinda inconsistent in the taste - some spoonfuls were bland and others were verging on overwhelming. my partner had a cone with mint and cookies and cream - i thought the mint was refreshing and she dug it too. the cookies and cream was blah. we'll be back to try some of the crazier and oft recommended flavours, but this place is only average for the basics and damn it, sometimes you just want a fine scoop of vanila.

there is a delicious selection of ice cream. i would recommend the ricanelas, toasted coconut, and ginger. there is so much to choose from that it's easy to stand in awe with a line of people waiting impatiently behind you.  on a warm sunny day in the mission, it is the kind of place that gets packed. it is small and located in an area with lots of people passing through. there are a few benches outside for patrons to sit outside. i like that the ice cream is served with a wooden spoon, it just seems to add to the whole ice-cream-eating experience without taking away from the flavor.

You can't buy wrong at Bi-Rite...ok corny pun intended. but seriously.  Some friends and I ate at Vietnamese place where the topic of best ice cream places in San Fran came up.  Our friends were raving about this place so we decided to skip dessert at the restaurant and head over to Bi-rite.  The said to expect a line, so when we got there, we werent too surprised about the line around the corner. Standing in line on a chilly "summer" San Fran night yearned for the succulent taste of ice cream dribbling onto the warm tongue makes waiting not fun.  Ana, who hands down has the be the best ice cream server IN THE WORLD.  Not only is she a tall beauty with a stunning smile...no matter how pissed off you want to be because you waiting in this line, her smile and warm charm puts to ease any unhappy feelings.  Interacting with her was almost as good as the ice cream.  Amazing experience...I got a card which means I'm headed back!

Yummmmm! I was on a Southwest flight to Las Vegas when I first heard about this place. They were listed in one of the SkyMall magazines you find on the airplanes and I remember reading all about their organic concept and unique flavor combinations. I salivated all the way to touchdown in LV and vowed I would go to SF to find this place. It took me a year to finally come here but I am glad I finally did! This place is amazing! The flavor combinations are to die for. I was able to try the Salted Caramel which is by far their most popular well known flavor and it is good! The salt really brings out the sweetness of the ice cream. I also tried the White Truffle lemon aioli salted ice cream which was amazing too!The honey lavender was good but tasted too much of lavender in my opinion. It needed something with it like crushed nuts to cut the sweetness. I ended up with a cup of their Ricanelas which is cinnamon ice cream with snickerdoodles crushed into it. So good! I woofed it down walking across the street to the Bi Rite Market. :) Overall so cheap for the price too. My cup of ice cream was the perfect size for me and only costed $2.95. I am so glad I finally came and I love that every carton and container and cup they serve is biodegradable and recycled materials. What a way to send a positive message!

The Salted Carmel Ice Cream is something that wakes me up at night and makes me crave it's creamy goodness. This is BI far my favorite dessert in SF. Call it fate, but there was no line when I went. We sampled a few flavors and decided to go with the Salted Carmel. My best suggestion for those people who just started seeing someone who is totally sexy but talks too much (and ok, let's be honest, you're really just dealing with the chattiness to get them into bed), take them here, buy him/her some Salted Carmel Ice Cream, shove a spoonful immediately into their mouth,  drive like hell to your apartment before the delirious ice cream coma wears off, BAM! Mission accomplished. They won't even know what hit them. All they will know is they want more of where that came from. (Ok, that's totally evil, but will SO work. For added effect, take the Salted Carmel to go and pop in the Notebook. Sealed deal guaranteed.)

Best. Ice. Cream. Ever.  Went here today with my roomie and my biggest regret is I've lived in San Francisco for over a year now and this is the first time I have been here.  I got two scoops for $3.25 - Honey Lavendar and Salted Carmel.  So good I ended up marching right back in and buying a pint of each to take home!  Pints are $7.99 which I thought was a little pricey.  Line wasn't too long, but either way it's well worth the wait!

i'm not much of an ice cream person so it's a crazy thing for me to give an ice cream shop 5 stars. but i give bi-rite 5 stars for allowing me to indulge on 2 flavors of ice cream for the price of a single scoop. my heart belongs to coffee toffee, salted caramel and balsamic strawberry flavors of creamy goodness. it's not often that i can actually consume an entire serving of ice cream without feeling ice cream overload but it's almost always guaranteed that that won't happen when i get it from bi-rite. heck, i'd even go there on a cold wintry night! doesn't that tell you something?

If you've ever had strauss creamery products, you know why this ice cream is fabulous. I personally liked the orange cardamom and ritual coffee toffee flavors, but I know, we all differ. I personally enjoyed how they used silver spoons for the tasting of ice cream instead of wasting plastic. Yay, BI-RITE!

My new favorite ice cream place!  Very creamy and rich.  I sampled the lavendar honey -- tastes just like it sounds...but I prefer more traditional-ish flavors.  I like how the samples are giving out w/ real spoons, a nice mom'n'pop shop touch.  I got a single brown sugar w/ ginger caramel, a seasonal flavor.   I went during the day, no line.  I went again at night, very long line :), so I opted to go to Bi-Rite market down the street and buy a small to-go pack for home.

One night, after having a lovely time at Tokyo Go Go, one of my fabulous friends and I decided we had to have ice cream no matter how freezing cold it was outside.  For people who love ice cream, you know what I mean.  And for people who really love ice cream, there is only one place in the city I would recommend: Bi-Rite Creamery. There is a reason you will wait in line.  Simply put, it doesn't get any better than this.  I swore off all other ice cream when the first spoonful melted in my mouth.  There are no words to describe their incredible salted caramel ice cream.  It nearly sent me into a state of comatose bliss--it's just that amazing. Here's a tip: get a larger container of this ice cream than you think you want at the time.  You will want to stash this in your freezer for later.  You will want more later.  You will keep wanting more later.  You will think about this ice cream during random moments in time when you are supposed to be working. You might even dream about this ice cream. You really will. There's only one thing I can think of that is better than this ice cream, and I will leave that to your imagination. Bi-Rite Creamery: yes, yes, yes!

maybe i'm just not in love with ice cream as the other people here are cuz i didn't think their ice cream was THAT great.  i had the coffee toffee, pumpkin, and the malted vanilla with peanut brittle and milk chocolate pieces.  almost $5 for two to three flavors.  i actually liked the malted vanilla because of the brittle pieces that were swirled into it.  i also got a taste of the salted caramel but wasn't exactly blown away.  all in all, my experience is just all right.  but since so many people love this place, maybe i'll give it another try next time and taste some other flavors before i lay down my final verdict.

i love bi-rite, even though i often find myself waiting in line - once i waited in line for half an hour and it was 10:30 at night. the wait comes from people sampling everything. however, the ice cream is so yummy and the flavors are great! my favorites are balsamic strawberry, coffee toffee, and salted caramel. it's also fun to get a sundae with your choice of toppings, too. just be aware, bi-rite ice cream melts fast! but i always like ice cream soup...

Minus one star because the pint that i brought home was labeled brown butter pecan. It wasn't - -it was ginger and nobody in the house except my son would eat it. I have to go back and return it.

I have to honestly say this is the best ice creamery in San Francisco. The flavors are limited to 10, but they are so delicious, you won't mind that they don't have a "bubblegum flavor"  ice cream or the sherbet variety at other places. Kidding. They do cover my favorites and that includes honey lavender, salted caramel and the double ginger. The only complaint I have is I still am shocked at myself for handing over $30 cash for 2 pints of ice cream. The cones and single servings are reasonably priced, but there's no discount for buying bulk.

I've been Bi-Rite ONCE, so I am basing this rating purely on taste.  The line was out the door and down the street much like a popular night club.  My boyfriend and I drove around looking for parking while our two friends went to wait in line.  Parking is terrible!  I think we must have parked a good 3/4 mile to a mile away.  On the plus side, by the time we got to Bi-Rite, our ice cream was waiting for us.  I had the salted caramel which was actually chosen for me.  I don't even know how to describe the power this ice cream had over me.  The flavor was so intense and so incredibly yummy.  Sometimes you get ice cream that has just a hint of flavor, but this was not one of those times.  I can't wait to go back and try more.  I might even boost the rating to 5 stars.

OK, based on all the raves, I was expecting this place to be phenomenal. It was not. Seeing the crazy lines, I swung by one day in the mid-afternoon on a weekday, no line. The workers were all really friendly, knowledgeable and not holier-than-thou, which I fretted. Anyway, the flavors are pretty cool (do I really need lavender in my ice cream?). I asked an off-duty worker what her favorite was, and she actually said Snickers. That turned me off right there. She told me they used organic ingredients, so that re-piqued my interest. I went with what I thought would be classy, pure flavors - coconut and, shit, i can't remember the second one, that's how non-amazing it was. Anyway, at least you can get two flavors in a "single" cup. They give you this flat double-ended wooden spoon (remind you of ice cream in a pull-top?). C'mon, can you at least gimme a spoon I can scoop with? The flavors were fresh, the dish creamy. But it wasn't outta-this-world amazing. Those of you from New England - - remember the original Steve's in Somerville (before they franchised?). It's not as good as that (no smoosh-ins!). So, yeah, in short, it's good, but not Berthillon-Glacier-Paris amazing or Giolitti-Rome-gelato amazing. And, in fact, I think Mitchell's gets the nod for the original but unpretentious (c'mon, did you say "lavender?!") flavors: buko, halo halo, langka, lychee, macapuno, and ube. When you go to Mitchell's, you'll also notice that the clientele seems more "real people" too (more clients of different ethnic backgrounds, ages, and income levels).

I never had a bad experience at Birite.  I'm from the east coast and have not run into a ice cream shop that has such amazing flavors and great sundae creations.  I miss this ice cream place so much.  Love the salted caramel.  I ended up trying lots of ice cream places in the Bay area, this was my favorite.

i fancy myself to have a diverse palate and for that reason i passed by the famous salted caramel and ordered the honey lavender. at first it tasted like potpourri, but i really started to like it after the initial four bites or so. it had a sweet honey flavor, but with the lavender my breath smelled like an old lady's underwear drawer/living room for a while.

when i crave ice cream. i crave salted caramel ice cream from bi-rite. it's literally addictive.  the more i eat, the more i want.  i also really like the balsamic strawberry and the toasted banana. there has always been a line when i go there, but it always moves fast. it's expensive for ice cream, but worth every penny.

One of my usual haunts - their ice cream is creamy and they have great flavors. I love their mint chip ice cream sandwiches and today i indulged in my hubby's brownie sundae...mmmmm! Ooey gooey warm fudge and caramel over whipped cream and spiced pecans....All of their flavors are good, even though I prefer fruit (strawberry balsamic, roasted banana, coconut), I like their coffee toffee and chocolate. Be ready to hit a wall when the sugar kicks in! :)

this place has some of the most unique and delicious ice cream flavors ever! i had the roasted banana, highly recommended! the earl grey one is also very good, really surprised me since you dont really find a lot of tea flavors in ice cream. cinnamon with snicker doodle bits are uh awesome as well highly recommended! :D -1 star only because it was such a long wait 10pm on a friday night. but that's pretty much expected right?

some flavors are out of this world, some are ok...i loved the ricanelas, the salted caramel and the roasted banana. i am a huge fan of lavender and honey and ginger, but theirs wasn't that great. the unenthusiastic scooper kind of make my experience a little drab and the cashier was kinda snippy with me because i didn't find the pints that i wanted in the freezer. i looked 3 times and didn't see my flavors, so i asked her to get them and she gave me attitude! i'll go back for ice cream in a mid week day night because i am sure that there are lots of people gathered on nice sunny days. they have a prime spot, especially being next to dolores park!

Cute small place with unique flavors. They're known for Ginger flavor but I think the local favorite is sea salt caramel. Personally I think their honey lavender is the best. Not too pricey with a good proportion size equals a great taste of creamy heaven. The only thing is the seating size. It probably only fits 10 people at most. Overall really great ice cream.

Some of the flavors are not quite you'd expect in an ice cream, but there's no doubt that they all push the envelope.  My favorite is the malted vanilla with peanut brittle and chocolate.  The roasted banana is has an unusually strong banana-y flavor, very much like overripe bananas, but it makes the best base for milkshakes that you can imagine.  Try blending roasted banana ice cream with fresh strawberries, a little orange juice and watch it quickly disappear!

The ice cream here is as great as you'll find.  Salty toffee is amazing, though it melts a bit quickly due to the salt.  They have great diversity of flavors, orange blossom, malted vanilla with toffee chunks, etc...  They're also happy to let people taste.  Buying take-home is really expensive, but it is great stuff.

The folks at Bi-Rite creamery know how to make ice cream.  Each flavorful scoop is served at the perfect temperature and with the perfect creamy texture.  Their unique flavor combinations (like honey-lavender, salted caramel, and balsamic strawberry) sound off the wall but always make my taste buds say "WOW"! Of course staple flavors such as chocolate and cookies and cream are available and made to perfection.  Bi-Rite Creamery is simply the best ice cream I have ever tasted.

My husband loves ice cream almost as much as he loves donuts.  When he first heard about this place from his friend, he was so excited to check it out.  He went a couple of times with friends, but finally I was able to make the trek with him to see what the buzz was all about.  I've been to Mitchells and Swensons, but in all honesty, weren't very memorable experiences.  Bi-Rite definitely delivered on texture and flavor.  I tried their Salted Caramel and Toffee Coffee and both were yummy to the tummy.  The Salted Caramel is a fan favorite, but my hat goes off to the "Ritual" Toffee Coffee (yes, you read that right, the use Ritual Roaster beans!).  It was a perfect combination of coffee flavor and crunchy toffee texture.  It was definitely multi-dimensional versus the Salted Caramel, which was good, but somewhat of a 'one note.'  I definitely want to go back and try some more flavors!  Now, just gotta try Humphry Slocombe....

However, my new favorite thing to get here is the "Afternoon Snack." which is roasted banana ice cream, home made graham crackers, whipped cream, and burnt caramel sauce. OMG this is the best! They will even do a small size for you if you don't feel like indulging yourself. Just be prepared to wait on hot days and occasionally on colder days. Well worth the wait though.

I went to my first picnic in Dolores Park yesterday and a friend disappeared, then returned with three pints from Bi-Rite--salted caramel, peanut butter fudge swirl, and mint chip--and ten wooden spoons. Suffice it to say that all three pints quickly vanished. The PB fudge swirl was extraordinary, the salted caramel was fantastic and original, and the mint chip was simply delicious. I don't know how much any of them cost, but they're surely worth it.

It is very difficult to park because there is only street parking and this is a very busy part of the city. If you have to drive to come here make sure you look up the menu on line and decide what you want, bring a friend and send them in to order while you wait in the car. I recommend studying the menu at home either way because they have some much great stuff.

Got the 3 scoop in a bowl: Salted Caramel, Toasted banana, Balsalmic Strawberry.  I was iffy about the balsalmic strawberry but I love me my strawberries and thankfully it didnt have that balsalmic (vinegar) taste to it that I expected.  It just tasted like regular strawberry ice cream to me.  Toasted banana tasted really good....tasted like the freshest banana ice cream u could ever have.  I was VERY impressed by the Salted caramel.  It didnt sound good to me when I heard about this flavor but judging by everyones reviews I had to try it.  I was not disappointed at all.  The salt enhanced the flavor of the caramel.  mmmmm mmmmm good.  I took off a star because I kinda wish the sizes were a little bigger.  But thats just me, when I think ice cream I like to have a huge bowl of it.  The scoops were small (to me at least).  But the flavors are delish!

I like going with others because I can snag a taste of theirs without having to stray from my normal order! I must try the soft serve one of these days though.

I tried the Roasted Banana, Creme Fraiche, and Balsamic Strawberry flavor ice creams on my first trip to Bi-rite a coupe of days ago.  They were all sooo good.  I had to go back today to try some other flavors.  This time I tried the Brown Butter Pecan, Coffee Toffee, and Salted Caramel.  I can't decide which is my favorite so far.  They are all good!  I'm going back next week to try 3 more flavors.  The staff are very nice and helpful.  They have seats around the trees outside which is nice.  A visit to Bi-Rite is a must if you love ice cream.

Always a huge line, but the trick is to get the prepacked ice cream if they have the flavor you want. Luckily ricanelas is one of my favorites and available in the pre-packed size. Would always go back,just wish lines would get shorter.

Love their roasted banana ice cream! Cannot get enough of this awesome ice cream. My friends that live in LA cannot wait to come back and have some of this great homemade ice cream. It's worth driving into the city to get this ice cream. I do not Iike caramel and salt but they made this into one of the best ice cream I ever tasted. Genius!

so amazing i wish i didn't leave you in san francisco. salted caramel blew my mind. also had a taste of mint chip which was good (not a fan of chips in my icecream) and cookies & cream or the more traditional flavors. next time, i'm trying the sundae with orange flavored olive oil. so crazy good even though there was a line down the block on a monday afternoon.

WOW.  Possibly one of the best things I ate on my food tour of SF!  The salted caramel was DELICIOUS, as was the brown butter pecan!  My friend said the roasted banana ice cream was by far the best she's ever had b/c of the roasted flavor (vs. normal banana ice cream).  I don't like banana-flavored things, but even I admit it was good.  The lavender honey was good... it made me feel like I was getting aroma therapy!  :)

oh how I dearly miss u Bi-Rite!! After moving back home to so cal, i have never quite found a good fix for my ice cream  craving since you have set the bar soooo high. I have constant craving for coffee toffee and honey lavender. I dont care what peope say about honey lavender, it does NOT taste like soap. It tastes like a little piece of heaven in my mouth. I have battled the crowds far too many times and stood in line on way too many freezing sf nights for some ice cream. But its all worth it for my cup of coffee toffee and honey lavender. Also, i initially was a skeptic when it came to the soft serve, but after one bite, i was converted. There have been times when I make my friends wait in the regular ice cream line  and i go get soft serve and eat it just in time for me to be in the front of the line with my friends for the regular ice cream. Yea im obsessed with bi-rite, yea if i had the chance i would make  a trip to sf solely for bi rite, yea i miss the ke$ha look a like serving ice cream with a smiele,  and yea i wish you guys opened up shop here in so cal!!

Believe every good review you have read on this place.  Best ice cream of my life, so far.  I had toasted coconut and roasted banana and it was nothing short of fantastic.  The line is a bummer but it is worth it.  My husband had the banana split and they carmelize the bananas... nothing short of amazing.  And for the quality you get, the prices are very reasonable.  I can't wait to go back.

I have been longing to visit this place for the longest time! I came here on a Friday night, the line was not too long ( I expected longer ). I got a medium cup with honey lavender, roasted banana and salted caramel. I must say the roasted banana and salted caramel are both very unique and is nothing I have ever tried before. However, I can live without the honey lavender, I felt like I was eating a Glade air freshener.

I'm not usually an "ice cream" fan, but I can eat this everyday. The salted caramel ice cream is wonderfully perfect. Not too sweet, not too salty. It gives you JUST enough "taste" so you can take another lick. Very smooth, light, and creamy! Maybe it's because they use organic ingredients!

Yes, Bi-Rite Creamery really is THAT good. This is a must-try in SF- I tried the famous salted caramel and Earl grey. No words to describe the amazing flavor and creamy texture. Seriously, this makes other ice cream taste icy! My only complaint is the lack of seating, especially when it's a chilly night. But i would still go, and just devour it all in my car! They also have soft serve next door, and only offer one flavor a day (along with vanilla). The night I went, the flavor was Mexican hot chocolate, which i wasn't too interested to try. And plus, I was already stuffed. The next day was salted caramel (!!!), but I didnt get a chance to swing by. Next time, I will have make it a point to try it!

it's really hard to form into words how i felt about the ice cream. i just kinda want to make noises and i'm pretty sure you'd understand, but yelp doesn't have an mp3 feature.  the line is down the block just like everyone says and you feel a little nuts for waiting in it, especially on a chilly day but everyone in the line is so happy to be in it that it just feels like you're hangin out on the block with the neighbors.  the staff does rush you a bit which is hard if you're a newbie like i was. there's just no possible way to compute all the creative flavors in such a small amount of time.  but they do let you try any of them, and with a real spoon which definitely enhanced the experience for me (don't ask i have a weird aversion to plastic utensils and such). you'd think that such cool and interesting flavors could only be served with a heaping side of pretension and snobbery, but this place is more like hippy utopia in only the best way possible. i ended up choosing the toasted coconut (noise: gggrllllmmsslmlmgr) and the balsamic strawberry (noise: aalalrflllnuuuuh) and now am totured by longing dreams of fresh tasty ice creamy special goodness on a regular basis.

After ordering a cake for my son birthday on Thursday. I , my BFF and oldest son decided to go and try Bi-Rite Creamery. We are die hard Mitchell's customers, but thought we would try it . First of all, parking is very hard to find on 18th St. When we got there, a meter man was waiting for a tow truck to tow a car on the "NO PARKING AFTER 4 PM" lane right in front of the store. We went in and we looked around and saw all the flavors they had to offer. BFF sampled the BROWN BUTTER W/ PECANS. I sampled TOFFEE COFFEE and ROASTED BANANA both very good. This place almost(not all the way)but almost converted me from Mitchell's. This is my number #2 place for ice cream from now on. Another great thing about this place is you can order ice cream cakes and pies, or just Oder regular cake w/out ice cream and they can do it for you. They also have a catering menu for ice cream party kits. Next time I plan to sample the other flavors of their ice cream.

i'm sure all the cool kids...or since it's the Bay..koo kids.. know this but Bi-Rite is down the street from tartine and as most popular places in SF go there is always a line. but dear God, if i have to stand in line let it be for ice cream as good as this. now i'm a fan of all things coffee and ice cream when done properly is awesome. so when i saw that Bi-Rite had combined the awesomeness of coffee with toffee pieces a tear ran down my cheek and i parked it. luckily the friendly servers move the line quickly and before i knew it i had a cone in my hand. one bite and i was sold. i hate coffee ice cream that doesn't taste like coffee and this one was perfect, just enough coffee for me to know what flavor i had but not overwhelming and the toffee pieces so inconspicuously hidden and just making an appearance to give a nice surprise to my every bite. love at first bite indeed. definitely visited on my 2nd trip to SF like two weeks later.

i wanted to go to the other ice cream place but my friends were too lazy to walk there.  we were coming from the park so this was close. plus i'd heard of it before. we waited in line and i was thirsty and really just wanted a drink. water or a milkshake. they dont have milkshakes but they do have water, so i got that. i had also been thinking if i were to have ice cream right now, i'd want black raspberry. nope, no black raspberry. flavors with oil, salt, vinegar, but no black raspberry. no shake. i guess im more of an ice cream traditionalist. i dont like ice cream all that well in the first place, so maybe thats why i want something simple. not as simple as vanilla (which they do have) but still. i tried my friend's strawberry soy ice cream... he liked it but no one else did. i tried my other friend's sundae it was ok not special. also bad that you cant get a kids cone unless you're a kid. or that's what the sign said. maybe if i asked they would have changed their minds. i just cant eat more than a kids cone of ice cream.

rituals coffee toffee is absolutely divine, especially if you get a scoop from a fresh full tub and get all the toffee sprinkled on top.  if you buy a pint, make sure you get a fresh hand packed pint, not one from the freezer.  the popsicles are great too, but overpriced.

adding to the raving reviews...yes.  i went to bi-rite for the first time years ago.  that one street just has great places...b/t tartine bakery and pizzeria delfina, bi-rite is the superb added bonus.  after moving up to norcal recently, i had to go back.  i have been back 3 times in the last 3 weeks.  one week i went twice!  i know...its all about the salted caramel although i have to say that too much of one thing makes it not so good.  we bought a pint and shared it last weekend with 3 friends...it was a little too much of the flavor.  a small scoop is perfect.  i've had the banana (highly recommend), coffee toffee (i still prefer baskin robbins jamoca more), and the toasted coconut (i still prefer the rite aid pinneapple coconut more).  toasted coconut has real coco flakes but i wanted more flavor...it was not as flavorful as i wanted it.  if you have never been to bi-rite, go!  lines are usually 15 - 20 minutes regardless of day/night it seems.  if you are up to purchasing pints (7.99 each), you can do that thru the soft serve window...i didn't know this until last time.  this way, no wait.
