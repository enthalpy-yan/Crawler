There are few things that win me over... and Bottega Louie macarons................. I give my heart to you! The cute packaging adds on to the excitement of receiving surprises from Bottega, but the content of these packages is what I fall in complete love with! Grand cru, earl grey, salted caramel... perfuckingfection.

Lots of small plates to share with friends or large plates for each other.  Great place to people watch and eating in the bar area is lots of fun as well if the place is booked up. You must purchase the macaroons and take some home with you from the bakery.  They compare to the best in the world.

My boyfriend and I came here to have a pre-Valentine's day dinner. We parked in a near by lot for $5 since we couldn't find street parking. We waited to be seated for a table for about 20 minutes, not too bad. We looked at the baked goods in the mean time. We were seated at a nice table next to the window. What impressed us was the service. We were probably the youngest people in there but the the staff were super friendly and helpful. The bread brought to the table was awesome! Idk if we were just hungry, but we asked for a second loaf. We also ordered Portabello Fries to split. We wish we got our own! The reviews on Yelp do not hype up these delicious fries!! I ordered the Prawns dish and my bf ordered the Clam Linguini. I thought they both tasted good, we left nothing on the plate! We had the Chocolate Souffle for dessert and it was sooooo chocolately and delicious!! I think it is worth the $15. Can't wait to go back again and try a new dish!

Pizza was the best I've had here, love the bread and butter. Server forgot to put an order in, we waited forever, but they comped the dish. Classy. . . .I don't care if you fuck up, but if you fuck up and don't give me some shit for free, there is a problem. So kudos there. The portion for the pasta was kinda whack . . .I mean for the money I spent on the dish it was more like an appetizer. The garlic made me very gassy and my poor girlfriend suffered the consequences when we got home. She was acting up a bit that day so I didn't mind making her uncomfortable in the wake of my flatus. I'll be back here, the lines kinda suck too, place is always slammed. It's a good restaurant. You should go love it.

We came on a Sunday afternoon to grab some desserts. It was St. Paddy's day so just across the street was the BIGGEST FESTIVAL in LA! Just by association around a great celebration, this place deserves exxxtra stars! Anyway, today, we got 5 macarons and a grand macaron for $20 - Nice walk from Visconti. Lol. 1mi away. - I remember coming here to celebrate a few of my friends birthdays and from a thug's perspective, cuz imma thug, lol, it's way too cute and girly! Food was tiny and presentation was at its peak! haha. You know... curly q status..xD - Anyway, Today we got some yummy macarons. I don't think they're better than lette macarons or patisserie manon. It's a bit too crispy and airy for my liking. But I heard that is how they are truly made. Eh..oh well, needs to be more chewy coming from an amateur. - Had to get the Grand macaron which is basically a macaron sandwich! Loved it! nom nom! so much g'nosh! - Great novelty here. Come here to impress small Asian girls. haha! :P

Bottega Louie is lovely place for brunch and dinner.  Yes, there tends to be a long wait, but if you charm the hostess, you somehow move up the list (works for me at least).   I usually avoid brunch that is heavily carb-based, but my curiosity was settled on the waffles.  My first instinct was that $15 for waffles is ridiculously priced, but since I have had good experience with their pastries, I decided to give it a try.  I was blown away with the texture and taste of the waffle.  It was perfectly toasted and lightly sweet.  I smothered butter, chantilly cream, berries and maple syrup and it was pure heaven at every bite.  Would definitely be back again for waffles. For dinner, I enjoyed the portobello fries, salmon crudo and Brussels sprouts.  All the small dishes are perfectly executed and have great flavor.  The quality has been consistent for me all the times I have visited.  The chocolate souffle is highly recommended.

This place is gorgeous! We arrived around 3ish so there was no wait and we got seated and served immediately. Per fellow Yelpers we got the portabello fries ($10) and tried the Mushroom pizza ($20). SOO GOOD! Our waiter, Peter, suggested the Butterscotch Busino ($9) which we ended up eating in seconds! Because everyone has reviewed their food, I want to shine a light on the fantastic service here (from our waiter, Peter). Peter and our other waiter were attentive, funny, and nice. I'm not one to really care about service if the food tastes great, but it was a nice reminder how friendly staff can really enhance your mood/dining experience!

Bottega Louie's macaroons are the perfect complements to my morning coffee. I've tried the earl grey, lavender, vanilla, and raspberry flavors; the earl grey and vanilla being my favorite two. And everything is packed in a really cute lavender box. Quite disappointed that they discontinued the matcha green tea flavoured ones before I even had a chance to try them. Hopefully, they will bring them back soon. Had a late brunch here as well on a Sunday morning and ordered kobe burger with some coffee and macaroons, of course. I would say that service here deserves a 5 star. The waiters here are very pleasant and quick to take your order. The kobe burger was quite substantial compared to the size of their pastries. I guess it's good that the macaroons are smaller in size so you can try more flavours before filling up your palate. Besides the delicacy of their macaroons, there is nothing substantially incredible about their food. But the small details such as serving your water in a chilled glass bottle, the servers, ambience and the packaging of your desserts really makes this a great spot for a good dining experience.

Welcome to another Re-Review... because saying how many times you'd return is just as important as how good a place is. For a full explanation of my rating system, please visit my profile. Re-Rating: "A" I award this place a Re-Rating of "A" because I will always come back for more. I have been here a few times, and it never disappoints. I highly recommend it. This place easily gets a 5-star rating because their food and desserts are of the highest quality and look just as great. This is a high end place so get ready to pay the max for everything. You will be surprised how big the place is when you first step inside. This place is a destination spot to show off to anyone. First time? Order like me! Box of macarons Tips: Bring your camera because I'm sure you'll want to Instagram or share your visit with everyone you know. Don't be shy about it either, everyone does it... and all the time too. Parking is bad so you'll have to use the street parking meters. Hopefully, there won't be any lingering bums asking you for change as you park. It is smack in the middle of downtown LA after all.

After the 4 stars and over 5000 reviews that this place had, I knew I had to try it. My gf and I were looking for a place for our last carbo-loading session before the LA marathon so we decided to give this place a shot. Reading the reviews about this place beforehand definitely upped my expectations, which is probably why I was a bit disappointed of this place. LOCATION: Excellent. Right on the heart of downtown. ATMOSPHERE: It is a very hip place and it looks like it's the place to be seen on a Saturday night. Which makes it VERY BUSY and VERY LOUD. We had to wait about 20 min to get a table (which wasn't too bad), but you could barely walk to the crowd to make it to the hostesses table to get put on the list. The place itself is very nice and minimalist, with high ceilings and plan white walls. FOOD: Food was ok, nothing fancy. I had the pasta Pomodoro and while it looked very plain at the beginning it was very rich and it was a total feast for my taste buds. My gf ordered the Fettuccine and it was really plain and simple. Per fellow yelper's suggestions, we tried the mushroom fries, which I have to say were pretty dissapointing. DESSERTS: Again, every review I read recommeded the macaroons so we tried the Rose and Earl Grey and they were OK, nothing fancy, but then again I'm not a big dessert fan. PRICING: OK for a fancy LA restaurant, expect to pay about $25/person for dinner/drinks. I'm glad we went to this place just to be able to say I've been there, looks like its a must go in downtown LA but I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon.

I went here for sunday lunch and it was super busy. I had to wait about 30 min - which wasn't too bad Service was great and food was great. I read the yelp reviews beforehand so I ordered mushroom fries! It was so~ good! MUST TRY! We also ordered pizza and raspberry beignets - yum yum!

The food was mediocre, but the pastries/desserts were sublime. It's trendy and noisy, so for those of you that hate crowds this isn't the place to eat. I would recommend the portabello fries and other appetizers as they are better than the entres. Since it's in DTLA you'll have to park at the pay parking.

As I'm sitting here stuffing my face with the macarons I picked up on my recent trip to LA, I thought I would write my review. This review is just for their french macarons. Okay, is it just me? Or do the pictures on Yelp make the macarons look deceiving bigger than they really are? LOL. Zoom out people! I might have to do one of those classic soda can comparison pictures for all of you so you can gauge the size of these macarons. I bought a box of 13 macarons - $26. The box is small at about 6" x 6" in so. The macarons are fluffy, yes, but some were just overly too sweet for me. The flavors are definitely interesting though. The Earl Grey, Rose, and Salted Caramel were probably my favorite. They're also really small for $2/piece. I think the deciding factor of why I probably wouldn't come back just for the macarons is because parking is horrible! You have to pay to park in a lot. But if you're like me and just want to grab a few macarons, good luck looking for street parking! I circled those streets a few times (one-way streets may I remind you) before I finally found a "loading zone" spot to quickly park and run inside. The building and Bottega Louie itself is beautiful though, inside and out! I would love to come back and have lunch here with a few girlfriends. :)

The interior of the place is fantastic with high ceiling and lots of tile; it was very clean and provided a really great atmosphere for dining. It felt spacious and intimate at the same time with a minimalist decor that opens the room up and then lets you forget about it. The service was fantastic; our waitress was incredibly knowledgable about what went into the food and was able to make suggestions for both of us, who have food allergies.  We were both very happy with our food, which boasted big flavors that are often lacking when you ask for things sans something or other. Holy macarons! The earl grey was amazing, as was the rose. I'd have to say that I'd go back again just for the desert!

With all the reviews on here already, I'll  TRY to make this short and sweet. TO-GO LUNCH: The to-go sandwiches here are to die for. You can pick one up for ~$8, which is normal for DTLA pricing and a steal for Bottega Louie.  My favorite was the Smoked Turkey and Gouda. The demi-baguette it comes on is phenomenal. DINING IN: For a Big Party - Get your monies worth getting a salad, pizza and PORTOBELLO FRIES! The best thing about the pizza is you can split up flavors on it. I'm a fan of the Bianco. For a Date Night - Have fun and try out their small plates! My favorites are PORTOBELLO FRIES, bruschetta and crostini! They used to have a goat cheese and beet salad, which I loved, but I don't see it on the menu anymore. Staple Dishes - The Trenne is always a hit! Dessert- Try out Chocolate Souffle and pour on the delicious cream it comes with!  You will have to order this at the beginning or midway through your meal to allow for the 20 min cooking time. DESSERT: Macarons are what they are know for so be sure to try all of them! Also make sure to try their other desserts, which they have on display at the front. The staff is super friendly and will help you out!   OVERALL: Yes, it's loud, hyped and crowded. But it's a DTLA staple and worth the experience at least once, but you'll find yourself coming back for more.

You can tell there is something special about Bottega Louie from 1/2 block away.  The restaurant and bakery shines out in the dark downtown scenery.   The line to request seating (no reservation here ) was long as we hit the restaurant during prime dinning hours.  The hostesses were very pleasant, friendly, cute and accurate with their estimates for when tables would be available; this was impressive as the restaurant was packed to the gills.  They were also very good about hunting down guest in the crowded bar/waiting area/bakery when their seat became available (taking a mobile number from willing guests could reduce the hunt...). The atmosphere is impressive (and loud) with the bakery, bar, restaurant, and food preparation areas all blending in the center of the facility.  The well-managed staff is on point to make everyone enjoy their dinner. The management team was working with the wait staff and this is a key to their great operation at Bottega.  Service, Service, Service!!!  I love it when my glass never empties and an empty dish is an affront to the staff. Our waiter was great and offered great recommendations and steering with menu items.  Friendly advise but no pressure; he offered honest opinions of what he liked. One of the dining area Managers (well-dressed, polished, and the consummate host) came to our table to see that we were having a good time and enjoying our evening.  This man lead his staff and they definitely respected his lead. Our drinks, appetizers, and food were delivered promptly which was impressive with the throngs of patron. Brochette and Caprese salad were the best we have had.  The neighboring table liked the look of my salad and ordered one themselves.  Fantastic mozzarella! Entrees were well-portioned and tasted great.  Hanger steak....YUM! We are new fans!  We had a great evening and will definitely return.  Great Job Bottega Louie!

*Review for dessert area of the restaurant OMG. THE TIFFANY'S OF DESSERTS!! Probably a little big exaggerated but when you and your BF share 3 desserts on a street bench outside the store, and immediately go back inside to get a few more, I think that it deserves an increase in stars. I was literally like a kid in a candy store here. Coming inside to fancy desserts and staff dressed in bow ties, the people behind the counter greeted us with warm smiles despite our casual San Diego uniform of shorts and flip flops. The dessert selection? Box them ALL up for me please!! Fortunately, I was able to grasp a hold of self control and limited myself to 1 1/2. The other 1/2 unfortunately went to my BF. We started with a Tiramisu Eclair, a shiny raspberry chocolate cake thing. and a small blackberry tart thing (excuse my lack of memory on what the name of the desserts. Who can pay attention when you just point to the one that looks good? And even that was hard... they all looked good!!) Tiramisu Eclair: A good dessert if you're not a fan of sweets although you do get a hint of it. Good flavors and a perfectly fluffy consistency. Raspberry Chocolate Cake thing: I'm not normally a big fan of fruit and chocolate (this was the BF"s pick) but damn, this sure changed my mind. A huge bite of semi sweet coco with a soft fudge like consistency and a hint of raspberry covering the chocolate. It tasted rich, but it was definitely not in a one bite and I'm satisfied kind of way. Blackberry Tart: the crust was really good, the blackberry was nice and plump and the cream was AMAZINGGGG. Light, airy, perfectly sweet. I regretted not buying the bigger one! Put it all together and you have 2 bites of perfection! Sooo we went back in and got a bigger berry tart thing and also another dessert with berries in it. I'll make this long story short by saying that we definitely should have brought more to bring back to SD. Also, they wrap everything up in a nice cute box. Even if you get only one dessert. Not like the plastic bags that every other bakery throws them in (jk - I don't want to be mean. I just really like the boxes). And their utensils? Possibly one of the thickest, softest, fanciest napkin that I've ever felt and the thickest, sturdiest plastic fork and knive I've ever felt! Anyways... You will definitely see me back here!!

It's hard to grade this place because there's so many types of experiences you can have here- from the bakery, to the bar, to the market, to the restaurant.   The bakery is maybe the best in DTLA- rightfully famous for its always-ready rainbow assortment of macaroons (which is the first thing you see when you walk in).  The beignets have the richest, most balanced hazelnut filling I can possibly imagine tasting.   Every dish I've had in the restaurant is well prepared with quality ingredients- but I've never been amazed, either.   The space is remarkable for its bustle- a large, bright, high-ceilinged room that invites you to linger and soak up its energy, while you peruse the deserts or occupy a cafe table and people-watch.  But the scale and acoustics of the room also thwart any efforts at genuine conservation or intimate dining with friends.

I've been to Bottega Louie a few times and the food is pretty good (although to be honest, its somewhat forgettable because I can't even remember what I ordered at my last visit).  Their dessert selection looks unbelievable but somehow I have always managed to restrain myself.   So why am I not singing their praises and typing in all caps as some other yelpers? I dunno, I don't dislike this place but I also felt it was a little generic.  Wait, what do you mean by generic...this is a huge unique space with the most amazing macarons?  I mean generic in this sense that this place feels like a...wait for it...tourist trap.  Its one of the LA eateries that you "have" to go to.  The food meets a certain standard and the interior is incredibly trendy, but it just felt like one of many trendy LA eateries that turn me off in the same way that I dislike shopping at the Americana.   Don't let my ho hum review keep you away.  If you are in DTLA and looking for a good restaurant, I would certainly list Bottega Louie among one of several recommendations.  And I'm also interested to go back and make a few selections from their dessert case.  I think Bottega Louie just caters to a certain crowd that I'm not a part of, one that wants to wear riding boots and fake lashes to breakfast (or tennis shoes and a sport coat if you are a dude).

There are way too many reviews on this place, so I'm going to make it short and sweet. Must trys:  bianco pizza, trenne pasta, portobello fries, french macarons (earl gray tea, rose, and salted caramel) and of course their chocolate souffle (worth the 20 min wait) This place is a bit overrated...and I say this only because there is an absurd amount of people that come here all dressed up and I don't see them eating.  They take up space and create the hour plus wait that it has become. The 4 stars is because I think the food I have tried in my handful of visits have been good.  It helps that I absolutely love their Earl Gray Tea macarons too!  :) Parking is a bitch, but it is DTLA so accept the fact that you have to pay the $8 for valet when you dine here!!!

Ah yes, the one restaurant that everyone in LA knows about. I was astounded by the opulence of this space: the bakery in the front, the open kitchen, and the high ceilings.  It felt very faux-Parisian, almost Vegas-like in quality. While perusing the patisserie offerings, we were quickly seated after a short wait. The menu has something for everyone ranging from chicken and steak, to pasta, sandwiches, and their more well-known offering of pizzas. I settled on the burrata pizza, which I've never had on pizza before. Aside from the burrata, the pizza was typical of what one might expect from an average Italian restaurant. According to my sister, the portobello fries are the bee's knees. As a fan of mushrooms, I can confirm this. The trenne pasta dish was also pretty good. You can never go wrong with braised prime rib eye with pasta. For dessert, we had already picked out a grand macaron, which was a giant macaron with a vanilla filling and raspberries. It did not disappoint. I can see why everyone brings visitors to this iconic restaurant in DTLA. The food is just okay, but the feel of the restaurant is something everyone should experience at least once.

Overhyped, overrated, overcrowded, overpriced. Though I've been here a few times because this place has won my mother and my friends over their love for me. Tip #1 - park at Macy's plaza and walk over. They'll usually give you validation if you ask. Tip #2 - ask for bread and butter. Tip #3 - try their macarons. Little pieces of heaven. But don't get greedy, they're super sweet and will clog your throat like an allergic reaction after a few. Pace yourself. Tip #4 - expect to shout across the table. This place has high ceilings and it is LOUD. On another note, it's a good place to take your mother whom you're obligated to have weekly luncheons with but don't particularly want to hear her constant criticisms. Typical Asian mom. Just kiddin' mom I love you. Tip #5 - come early, check-in and expect to wait. They do not take reservations and are actually quite snobby if you call and ask about current wait time. "I cannot tell you the wait time you have to be here." Other notes: -  Portobello fries: I'm an avid mushroom lover and somehow, this didn't impress me. It becomes "too much" after a while. - Pizza: not impressed at $20. Maybe because I'm a chewy crust kind of gal. - Pasta: Trenne with braised prime rib eye is a hit or miss depending on the days. Some days the prime ribs are dry and the pasta are past crunchy. - Short Ribs: also a hit or miss depending on days. Sometimes the beef melts in your mouth, and sometimes it's dry like wood. Their pastries section sings out to me though.  I adore European patisserie. The colors, the berries - such a difference from your overly-frosted chocolate cake from neighborhood Ralphs (nothing wrong with frosting though). My bucket list shall be that I try every single cake in this place.

Amazing macarons!! And this is coming from a former macaron-hater! Yup, that's right I have officially converted, hopped on the macaron band wagon--whatever you want to call it! I sampled their earl grey, lavendar, salted caramel, and vanilla flavors--all extremely delicious! The filling was flavorful and aromatic, and the outer layers were so chewy and tasty! The only complaint I have is that their rose macaron had so much rose flavor that it reminded me of my loccitaine lotion, not the most pleasant association. I also had a chance to sample their smoked salmon benedict ($18--quite pricey for so little on the plate!). The smoked salmon was delicious, meaty, and had a great smokey flavor to it! It added a great complement to the eggs, hash, and onions! If you don't mind paying a little more money for a fancy brunch, I definitely recommend bottega! To avoid huge crowds, i suggest going to bottega when it's not during mealtimes or early morning before 11 AM. A saturday night will require a 2 hour wait while a saturday morning at 10 has no wait! So take into consideration of the time you go to bottega as this is a extremely popular restaurant!

I was walking the streets of downtown LA, and came in to break from the summer heat.  My friend and I knew that the macaroons were super famous here, so decided to order a couple.  They are color-coded in a giant glass display case right as you walk into the cafe, which immediately sets a whimsical and playful tone. I ordered the salted caramel macaroon.  It was dainty, delicious, and lived up to the media frenzy surrounding the place.  The architecture of the building is also spectacular, and the reason I rated it so highly.  Regardless of how the food is (did not taste it myself) Bottega Louie was the perfect place to sit, relax, people watch and have a macaroon and iced coffee on a hot summer Los Angeles afternoon. Really a breath-taking landmark.

Had lunch in the cafe area with my friend on a Saturday. Decently crowded, but we were able to snag a table quickly. Portabella mushroom fries - $10, so delicious. Definitely the highlight of the meal. BLT - $12, good, but really, really rich. The bread was really, really buttery, and in conjunction with the bacon and the avocado, possibly a bit too rich. Panzanella salad - $10, was alright, but I wasn't happy with the size, which was like a generous side salad. Also the croutons were kind of hard and soggy at the same time. However, I think most people come here for the bakery - the only thing I've had from the bakery was the panna cotta, which is super delicious, but I hear the macarons are good as well.

This place is decent - fresh ingredients, great ambiance, semi-warm customer service (expected since this place is so bougie). I just think this place is a tad overrated. I would definitely come back again and recommend, but its macarons aren't to my liking. They're on the dry/sand papery side. Unique flavors like rose, passion fruit, etc, but there was so much hype around the macarons that I was sorely disappointed. Dinner-wise, Portions are a bit too small for the prices. My friend and I got a caprese salad which was really good.  The mozzarella was super fresh. Would definitely recommend. We also got some kind of seafood pasta (sorry it's been a while and I can't exactly remember all the details). I remember it being pretty good and flavorful but it came out lukewarm. Also got a lobster soup.  It was good, but had 4 little chunks of lobster in a bowl that was half full.  Was this for presentation? I'm not sure. Overeall, Good food, just a bit overpriced.  Hard to talk there because everything echoes with the high ceilings. Next time ill skip the macarons and try their other desserts.

Rolled up this weekend with three lady friends and we decided to split a couple of dishes - none of us were crazy starving.  I've been to the restaurant a half-dozen times - mainly for brunch which is always solid... Caesar salad - great - a place like this isn't gonna mess up a Caesar salad, knowwhatImean? Burrata Pizza - REALLY nice. Prosciutto was sliced a'nice and a'thin on top. Good stuff. Tagliatelle Bolognese - DISAPPOINTING. The pasta, while fresh, was too thin for what I'm used to. I'm an Italian guy (ya think?) so I'm picky as hell about my pasta. And the bolognese sauce - Madonna Mia - it tasted like it was out of a Chef Boy-ar-dee can! NO GOOD! Kind of a bummer. Don't get me wrong - I'll come back to Bottega Louie - most of the stuff I've eaten here has been great. But that bolognese - ooof. Don't do it.

While I prefer Colori Kitchen Bottega Louie is all Ambiance. Very New York City Style dining ( also very handsome waiters he he) Drinks! The Champs-Élysées was very strong! almost too strong but that is not a negative I love that they offer sparking water! I've had the Lasagna with Bechamel while it was very tasty there was only a thin layer of Bechamel on top I was hoping it drizzled would be all over... maybe they just skimped on mine? Anywho still delicious.. The Chicken Parmeasn is good but not great  ( also not fried) Portobello Fries are awesome! a must have The pizza was EH honestly way too dry The capuccinos are divine and the Creme Brulee was honestly the best I have ever had. Oh and the Macaroons! Love the earl grey and rose.. although sometimes they can be a bit dry...

I am the 5th thousands something fan to write about Bottega Louie. Needless to say this restaurant has the best customer service and its food are pretty unique and tasty. The price is definitely overpriced but their quality of food, presentations of the food and servers themselves are worth of paying. Pleasant experience!

I like the feel of this place;  bringing the outdoors in as the place is spacious and pretty massive; high ceiling and huge floor plan.   Food is great and the desserts to die for.  I also like the mixed crowd of young and old.  Not for business discussion or transaction deals as it is quite noisy and does not make it ideal for serious conversation.     Overall, considering everything, a fun place to be while having a good meal..

What could I possibly say about Bottega Louie that hasn't already been said? I came here for the first time, for my birthday earlier last month and I had a fabulous experience. It was on a Monday night, and they do not take reservations so we came around 6:30pm and only had to wait 5 minutes. So if you happen to come on a weekend I'd say come a little earlier before you're starving. First let me start off with when you first walk in you're slapped on the face with all the beautiful macarons! Ugh.... Deadly. There's also a beautiful display of their other pastries and desserts. Hard to resist while you're waiting to be seated or on your way out. Bottega Loiue is simply stunning. It's classy and tastfully decorated. With high ceilings and white walls and gold trim. I just loved everything. Our server for the night was Ben, and all I have to say is he gave us the best customer service and experience this night. We started off the night with a couple of cocktails. We ordered the "Moulin Rouge" ($12) which was a grapefruit cocktail and it was delicious! Ben had them take the simple syrup out of mine because I don't care for my drinks too sweet, and it was just right. I loved how tart and refershing it was! So of course we got another round! They give you some freshly baked bread while you wait for your food, and it was so warm and soft. To start off we ordered their French onion soup ($8) and their portobello fries ($10). I don't think I can fully express how delicious these two items were. SO GOOD!!! My GOD! I was at first iffy to order the portobello fries, because they were either going to be really good or really bad. and DAMN were they REALLY GOOD! I seriously wanted to order more but didn't since we still had more food coming... The French onion soup was bowl licking delicious! I really didn't want to share this soup... I wanted it all for my self! Haha I could honestly come here and just order those two items, and I think I will on my next visist which needs to be ASAP. For our maint entrees we ordered the Burrata pizza ($20) and the Chicken Carciofi ($20). The Burrata pizza was good, but I wouldn't order it again. Next time I think I will order their Napoli or Sausage pizza. The Chicken Carciofi was very very good! I loved the saltyness the capers gave the dish! A+! For dessert I was surprised with a Chocolate Souffle ($15) and they decorated it with a chocolate happy birthday message and a raspberry holding a lit candle! Aww so sweet! It was very delicious! I feel like I've over used that word by now, but I must tell the truth! HA! Also before we left we bought some Macarons.. We had to.. No choice. We bought the box of 5 ($10) and the box of 13 ($26). My favorite ones were the lemon, strawberry and passion fruit! Thank you Bottega Louie for making my birthday a delicious and special one! I can't wait to come back! And also I'd like to thank Ben, because although the food was fantastic, you are also a reason I will come back! Best customer service!

Great restaurant with affordable prices. Do you like mushrooms? If the answer is yes, you'll need to try the portobello fries. The fries portobello fries are so addicting and it's probably because of the flavorful dipping sauce it comes with. I think the dipping sauce is aioli. I tried the trenne pasta and I'll have to say that it's the best pasta I've ever had at a restaurant. The pasta comes with braised prime rib eye that's very tender, Tuscan black kale, and shaved grana parmesan. My favorite part of the restaurant is the kitchen which is open so you can view the chefs preparing the meals.

This place is hyped up, I gave it a few tries but honestly now I will only go if my friends pressure me into it. People aren't wrong about the Portobello mushroom fries, they are delicious but that is where it stops, my friend and I ordered pasta both tasted like frozen ones you get at the supermarket. I swung by for breakfast/brunch early one morning because I heard great things about their brunch I ordered the salmon benedict which was very bland and $5 bacon because I thought... how can $5 bacon be bad?? The bacon was chewy not crispy and delightful. The place is terribly loud, not a good place to take a date for conversation, its super crowded, celebrities sometimes stop by the interior is modern and very eye appealing. Overall, I think I can get better food at a local mom and pop shop at a cheaper price.

I was visiting downtown LA this past weekend, and thankfully I walked by Louie on my walk home. This place is really amazing! I was not able to sit down to dine, but I did visit multiple times for treats. I basically tried every macaroon flavor they had, and all I can say is SALTED CARMEL. These things were to die for! The vanilla, strawberry, pistachio, and lemon were all delicious. I brought some macaroons home for friends, and I am getting nothing but great responses from them. My next trip into town I will make sure to have brunch!

Albeit a bit crowded, the quality of the food is amazing. I've been here once for brunch and multiple times for the macarons, with the salted caramel being my favorite. I don't think I have to say much about this place since it's already popular. Just give it a try - it lives up to the hype.

Hit and miss. I would try this place again though because the menu is so extensive and give it another shot. We came here for weekend brunch, and had no problem getting a table, which was nice.  Sometimes the line here is RIDICULOUS! The baked good I had was awesome - the apple danish.  Nom nom nom. The NY breakfast sammy was meh.   Portabello fries - awesome! Eggs benedict - pretty good Farmers market breakfast - total disappointment.  My boyfriend ordered this and was actually mad afterwards.  It was so watery that the whole dish was just swimming in water and turned into a weird soup mixture that he didn't like.

I've brought several people here just to walk through!  It's like being on the set of an Audrey Hepburn technicolor movie.  The visuals are just lavish. Good thing the food here backs up the atmosphere.  Bottega Louie is a smart after theater choice in downtown.  Sure it's a bit of a walk (or short drive rather...) but it's the retro-hip early 1960's atmosphere and look of the bakery and bar area that make you feel like a star in your own swinging 60's film. One smart thing they've done is sell wine by smaller tasting amounts so you don't have to commit to a whole glass if you don't want to.  Their portabello fries are worth coming for alone. After a visit to Bottega Louie all is right with the world...

SUUUUUCH a cute place! It's a restaurant + cafe + bakery! If I could depict the essence of LA in a restaurant, it'd be something like this. The best part about it is it's very affordable. Prices range from $12-$20 for food. The only drawback is that the food isn't THAT delicious. Even the most basic of things like French Toast was soggy on the inside :-/. The green juice was amateur, etc etc. There is a great variety of macarons, however, and they are made just right! ($2 each) Parking = yeah right. Cab it or walk it. Overall, I can't wait until I move to LA so I can bring people that come visit me here. Oo wee imma be all cute and edgy!

We decided to take a peek inside this place while waiting for Seven Grand to open. Its a beautiful restaurant with really nice pastry/sandwich area and bar/restaurant area. We planned to eat somewhere else so we decided to try some macarons. They are a little pricey at two dollars a piece but we really wanted to try them. We asked the gentleman at the counter to recommend their highly selected macsrons and he selected five on our behalf. We ate each one trying to figure out what the flavor was for each one. We enjoyed every bit of those macarons and can't wait to get them again. I have had macarons once before at another place and they were awful. I was really surprised how good these were. Yum!

The pizza is definitely great. You can see the pizza masters flipping the pizzas in the back while you are eating in the dining area.   Portobello fries were amazing, very crispy and tender.   The caprese salad was too salty.  I didn't like it. The chocolate souffle was good, very warm and moist.

Went here around 2pm on a Sunday and there was only a 30 minute wait.  According to my aunt & uncle, that is not typical. But hey, guess we had a stroke of luck! And I didn't mind waiting at all--we got coffee from the bar, sat in the open bistro seating, watched the chefs cook up the food in the open kitchen, and admired the sweet treats (super awesome instragram opportunity hah). The hostesses were friendly and polite, and instead of screaming out "MARIA PARTY OF 3", they remembered us as they came to seat us (although I think that may be typical). The service was excellent--our waitress was very sweet, attentive, and made great suggestions on the menu. I ended up ordering the following from the Brunch menu (http://www.bottegalouie.…): 1) Portobello Fries: AMAZING. Perfect seasoning, not oily at all, and the dipping sauce was delicious.  We ended up taking them home because there were more than enough for 3 people. 2) Smoked Salmon Benedict (got Avocado on it): PERFECT. This is my favorite thing to order for brunch, and they didn't fail to impress me. Every bite was light and flavorful, and it was very filling :) 3) Roasted Potatoes: NOMNOM!! Perfect balance to my main dish.  Great serving size (shared between 3 people). If I ever make my way back to LA, I will be sure to go back here. OH, do not forget to bring some Macarons home :) $10 for 5. Amazing way to savor the experience, even after you leave.

My fiance and I came here on a double date with my friend and her husband. I was impressed by the ambience and by their bakery/"macarons" display. However, I thought the food wasn't all that great. I had done a little bit of research with their menu before-hand  and opted for the fettucine. Fiance got the Clam Linguine. The food was not that good. We ended up paying about $30 pp (for each in our party). All I ordered was the pasta, and a glass of wine. Fiance ordered his pasta and a drink as well. We also got the "Grand-Macaron" for dessert which was a HUGE macaron with fruits in it. Pretty yummy. Unfortunately, the Fettucine was not super off-the-wall good, and it didn't fill me up at all! There was no meat in it at all, and it just tasted okay. Fiance and I had to make food at home after because we weren't full! Thankfully we did pick up a box of Macarons though - they were delicious and the box was super cute. Thus the solid three stars - 4 stars for the Macarons and atmosphere and 2 for the food. Maybe will come back here for their bakery goods but not to dine in.

Just dined at Bottega Louie and was disappointed.  The food was good, but poor experience and it wasn't mitigated.  We got salmon benedict ($18) and meatball sliders ($12).   To preface, we came in just before 9 am, so we were the first people in the place.  We ordered and then waited around 45 minutes and the waiter let us know it was because the meatballs hadn't been sufficiently prepped.  When they arrived, the meatballs were very good but, predictably, the salmon benedict and the side of fries that came with the sliders were cold (like us, they'd been sitting there waiting for the meatballs).  I was starving so I ate the meatballs with the cold fries. We never send things back, but when you pay $18 for an egg dish, you expect it to at least be warm.  They brought us another one after I had already finished the meatballs and they were cleared.  The benedict tasted very good, but not being able to eat with my partner made for an awkward and unpleasant dining experience.   You'd expect that given this obvious shortfall, they'd have comped it, but instead they chose to comp the meatballs, presumably just because they were cheaper, though it was the benedict that had to be sent back.  This was our first experience here, and though the food was good, we won't be back.

Our group of 6 showed up at 10 without a reservation and the lady took our name down. I found it a bit odd because although the restaurant wasn't too full at that time and there was an empty table that could fit us, we had to wait 20 minutes and they sat us down at that same empty table. The food was delicious--the girls ordered sweeter dishes, the waffles and french toast, and the boys ordered savory; we all seemed to prefer the savory dishes, though the sweet ones were still very good. We had the mushroom fries for the table that were delicious--I 100% hate mushrooms and never eat them but I actually ate a couple here and enjoyed it! (I'm sure it didn't hurt that they were very heavily battered and fried). When we left by maybe 11 or 11:30 it was really packed. We stopped by the bakery side and I ordered a couple of cookies and the passion fruit tart to go. Both were delicious! Overall, this brunch was really nice and special. The food is not the best in LA by any means, but its still very good and it's in such a beautiful place and everything is made so pretty.

Yayyyyy!! I told my bf to bring me back a souvenir from his LA business trip and he surprised me with macaroons. I received a set of 5 and although I don't remember all of the flavors he got me, at least I remember my 2 absolute favorites - passion fruit and earl grey. passionfruit - sour at first taste, but it really grows on you and I loved it! earl grey - the prettiest of them all! flavor was nice and settle and it was very delectable. Can't wait till babe goes back down to LA again, hehe. Oh yea, my 200th review!! :D

5 stars just because of those damn delicious macarons! Parking is on the street and can see it being hard but for these delicious bites its worth it. The Macarons are 2 bucks per piece but i dont care ill pay! My mom said there must be something in them that make them so delicious. The violet, matcha green, vanilla and earl grey are my favorite. Salted Caramel is great too.  Eat them right away and you'll experience pure bliss. The box they come in make them look so Neiman Marcus and Tiffany's like but instead of expensive jewelry its expensive pastries. One day i will try the creme brulee.  OH MACARONS! LOVE IT.

I finally got my Bottega Louie fix. It only took me like 3 years to check this place off my list, but hey I was in the area, and I needed my Macarons fix so it was perfect timing. I came in on a random late Friday afternoon, and I was surprised that it was still packed from the late lunch eaters. But the wait was only 20 minutes for a table so it was reasonable. I got my macarons fix while I was waiting for my table and at 5 for $10, that's at par with the other macaron joints I've visited, but at least you get a nice fancy schmansy box to hold the macarons. They had a dozen or so different types of macarons available The portabello fries was decent. It's a popular item here, but I wasn't really feeling it. Still it's good to snack on something while my pizza was being baked. And I have to admit that pizza was pretty darn good. At $20, the pizza was a decent size, maybe 2 people can share and have it all down whole, but it was just me dining in today, and I definitely had to bring some back home to finish it. Nicely baked, the thin crust was enough, baked in their special oven for baking pizzas only. I love this type of pizza style and I would definitely come back for more. And as for my macarons, I got to try them for the first time when I got home, and they were nice, moist and delicious as well. That box does hold up the macarons to keep it in its proper shape. Service was decent. I have to give to these guys for doing it all day, especially if it's busy all day. It's probably not a place for a romantic and intimate setting. It does get pretty loud with the random kids, loud conversations and everything else that is going on. And there are a lot of random tourists loitering around by the bakery side just taking pictures.

I came here for lunch for a friends birthday and none of us could decide what to order, so we ordered a bunch of things and shared them all.   We got: Minestrone soup Caesar salad Fettucine Belmondo Artichoke Pizza. The soup was very good, nothing to really say about it since I like pretty much every minestrone soup I try. The salad was good as well but I hate when restaurants serve salads with romaine hearts.  Can you please just chop the damn lettuce?? I didn't pay $10 to eat a salad to have to sit here to cut up lettuce.  THOUGH it is my fault for not reading that there were romaine hearts in the salad and asking them to cut it up for me. The fettucine was a hit with my friends but I wasn't really a fan.  with fettucine, cherry tomatoes, roasted garlic, argula, olive oil, cracked pepper and parmesan, I thought it was a little bland in my opinion, but then again I like my pastas super saucy.  Definitely a lighter pasta choice for sure.   My favorite item was by far the artichoke pizza. The artichokes and the cherry tomatoes tasted fantastic together.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE goat cheese so I was in heaven eating this, it was such a good touch to what might have been a semi boring pizza.   As for their famous desserts, I don't really like macaroons, but theirs are fantastic.  BEWARE not all flavors are equally good.  I'd stick to safe ones like strawberry or raspberry. Service was good and prompt.  I love the ambiance here, so open and spacious yet so chic and elegant.  Prices weren't bad, perhaps a tad overpriced, but then again you're paying for ambiance and the location so it's all good.

My review will strictly be on what I ordered: Vanilla Macaron - Specifically, the flavor profile is vanilla BEAN.  Very neutral in flavor for those non-adventurous eaters.  Texturally, this is how a macaron should be. Earl Grey Macaron - I'm not a a huge fan of earl grey, however this was pleasant.  It had citrus/orange undertones with a sort of leafy/piney flavor profile.  Texture was consistent throughout. Cassis Macaron - For those that don't know what cassis is, you will be confused at this flavor.  It is sort of like a berry jam/jelly flavor. I enjoy this one. Matcha Green Tea Macaron - This one tasted like a traditional Japanese green tea.. somewhere along the lines of fresh seaweed. Not a huge fan of green tea pastries, only drinks.   Salted Caramel Macaron - Probably my favorite.  Most place mess up salted caramel anything, but this place got it down. OVERALL:  All the shells were consistent in texture.  I've been to places where each macaron had it's own texture, which is a sign of poor production.   Like I always say, YOU WON'T KNOW UNLESS YOU TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!

I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars. Stopped by for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and was surprised to be seated within 10 minutes. Ordered the salmon millefeuille and sausage pizza. The salmon millefeuille was good, definitely different since it looked like a pastry but had a layer of salmon over it. The sausage pizza was disappointing. I guess I expected it to taste better for $20. I should have ordered belgian waffles or something.... The utensils are a bit dirty. I looked at my fork and saw some dried eggs stuck in between the prongs of the forks. We also ordered the Le Grand Macaron was not disappointed .Very tasty and sweet, and I ended up purchasing more macarons to go. Service was good, but I expected more from their food. I would still come back though,..can't get enough of their macarons.

Call me crazy, but every time I walk into Bottega Louie, I like to pretend I'm starring in a previous episode of one of my favorite shows growing up, Gossip Girl (okay, except for the fact that I'm not living in Upper East Manhattan nor do I know anyone by the name of Chuck Bass). High school girl fantasies aside, I love Bottega Louie. It's one of my favorite places to eat in downtown and has some of the best macarons I've ever tasted in my life (and I'd like to consider myself a macaron expert). The restaurant is HUGE, very easy to find, and the food here is delicious. I've been here for both brunch and dinner and I'd recommend the portobello fries, margarita pizza, chocolate soufflé, and tiramisu. The one item I wouldn't recommend is the BLT (which was my fault for once ordering it anyways). If you're coming here for dinner, be prepared to wait. Luckily there's a bar that you can indulge in pre-dinner. As for brunch, I've come at around 10-10:30 and never really had a wait. The most recent time I can here a few weeks ago, valet parking was under construction so you can self park across the street in the garage. I've never had a problem here with service. If you're looking for a hip, trendy spot to have some dinner and catch up with friends, I'd definitely consider Bottega Louie.

Came here for Valentine's Day. I hate the fact that it's in the heart of downtown LA.  FYI:  Finding parking sucks so you most likely will have to pay at a parking structure or one of those parking lots.  I paid $12 for being there for only 1.5HRS.  Lame.  Our waiter told us he usually parks at a parking structure for $8 a day but I'm not exactly sure where it's at so gluck with finding it. We came here around lunch time and it was super packed but we only waited about 10MIN to get seated.  After finally getting seated, I got to admire the wonderful atmosphere.  I loved the high ceilings and the decor.  So lovely.  Anyway, I really didn't know what to order but we both ended up getting different pasta dishes.  I got the one with shrimp and veggies and my bf got the one with mussels.  Both were ok.  I think the star was the macarons, of course.  I'm a fan of the salted caramel.  So delish!!  Again, fast service and the customer service was impeccable. My first experience here was alright but if I ever come back here, it wil be for the macarons and not the food.

I LOVE IT SOOOO MUCH! First of all it is beautiful in Bottega Louie. Since easter is almost here all the colors are pretty pastels and I guess the color scheme changes with the holidays and seasons. Before dinner we could not help but stop at the bakery and fill up on pastries before dinner. Cherry éclair= Delicious! Beignet (plain)= Delicious also.. Vanilla cupcake= Not as sweet as I thought it would have been and it was really nice and creamy and delicious.. Then we sat at our table and for some reason the chef came out and introduced himself and shook our hands. he also sent out for appetizers that were really good. Some sort of meat and potato thing= DELICIOUS!! Mozz and pesto I think=really good Mushroom fries??=Nice Brushetta and pancetta I think= So good I wasn't paying attention when they told us what they were, SORRY. Also tried the Mac and cheese and lasagna and pepperoni pizza, all really good. The overall experience is what makes it 5 stars for me. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the atmosphere!! I went back the next day for MORE pastries and was helped by a sweet kid named Billy. I love it!!!

I wish we went here sooner coz I want to go back and try everything. We only got to try a few items on the menu but everywhere around us, folks were ordering beautiful food. The pizza dough was different from others I've tried, I usually like mine thin crust, but the one we got was soft, chewy and tasty. I'd love to try the pepperoni and napoli next time. The portobello fries are deep fried portobello mushrooms which was a nice surprise, don't know why I never thought of that before. I can understand why this would be a great vegetarian destination, so many great choices for those boycotting meat. I think the best part of Bottega though is dessert. The macarons are perfect. We got the pie sized raspberry macaron and it was perfect. It wasn't sweet, it wasn't dry, it was tangy and absolute perfection. I was hoping for a chocolate surprise inside, but instead it had tiny flower petals and cream. We tried a dark chocolate raspberry cake too and I had to stop myself from devouring the whole thing. It looks gorgeous and tasted heavenly.  Will definitely go back and try more.

Why why why do you not take reservations? The wait is endless. Luckily, you can line up for a shorter wait for some A-MAZING macarons of every color of the rainbow and more. Earl grey was my favorite, which is surprising since I don't normally enjoy fragrant foods - but this one was magical. After enviously watching the cooks put together magnificent salads and sandwiches, you finally get seated, screaming for joy - but no one hears you because it is that frickin' loud - and anxiously, you wait to order. Our waitress was super nice, which helped ease the hunger.  I went for the lemon ricotta pancakes and our table shared an order of the portobello fries. Were they worth the wait? Not sure if it was the hunger taking over, but YES...they were. Pancakes were sweet but not too sweet with that zesty tang of lemon and the creaminess of the ricotta. I ate each and every pancake without the normal "waaay too sweet" nausea that I usually get whenever I order pancakes. And those fries - let's just say we should've ordered another round. We were scrounging for every last crumb of fried fungus goodness. So...4 stars because of the incredibly yummy macarons, pancakes and portobello fries. I would take 1.5 stars away for the ridiculous wait and the headache-inducing volume of screaming patrons...but I give 'em the half star because I'm salivating just writing this review.

I've heard about this place for ages and finally got a chance to check it out. I thought it was pretty good. I enjoyed my eggs benedict but I have to say I'm excited to try their pizza for lunch and dinner. Is it worth standing in line for a long time? I think very few restaurants are but if you can get in quickly I recommend brunch an picking up some macarons on the way out. There is $8 parking across the street. The $5 parking got demolished. I concur that the servers/staff look like models (male/female) but then again it is Los Angeles. Our server looked like a guy from an Armani cologne ad and the other guy looked like a taller Joseph Gordon Levitt.

Came here for brunch with a friend.  Although online, the menu states that the entire menu is available at 3p, it was actually available since opening!   Ordered beignets, americano, smoked salmon eggs benedict. Everything was delicious and service was great! Complimentary sparking water was a huge plus. Bought macarons at the counter on the way out.  It's a must-try if you come here.  At least get a box of 5!  Cooked to perfection with amazing flavors to choose from. No wonder this place is so busy!

I am sure BL doesn't need my review as they have over 5k reviews, lol. But I just wanted to add to what everyone already knows, I love the pastries here; they're not just beautiful, but taste as good as they look. Just a few notes if you have never been here: Make sure you have a good amount of money ;) The $5 parking next to the French bistro is worth it, don't rush yourself by doing metered. There will be a wait if you want to dine at a table. If the wait is too long, head over to their "ready to go" section, the fresh salads and sandwiches are delicious! The potato salad has a nice kick.   If here try: Chicken Ceasar salad, Caprese sandwich, Smoked Turkey sandwich, Roast beef sandwich, yogurt parfait. The gorgeous pastries are made to tempt, so be ready to work out like crazy afterwards. Do breathing exercises while in line and or maneuvering the crowd, it can get hectic. Most importantly, enjoy!

We ordered their Lemon Ricotta pancakes, lobster hash, and the chocolate soufflé. I also tried the Grapefruit juice, which I didn't enjoy very much, but the rest of the meal was amazing. Although this place is expensive, it is a nice brunch treat if you are in the mood for splurging! Our waitress was attentive and kept checking up on us. I love treating myself out to a good meal every so often; I know ill be back in the near future.

Finally I visited Bottega Louie. It's located in heart of downtown LA so it's crazy hard to find parking!!! I only went to the patisserie for deserts. I have heard many amazing reviews from my friends and was so excited to finally try their macaroons. It very clean and neat loved the displays looks like very high end patisserie. Pro: Looks Great! - dessert, interior, and displays. Cons: overcrowded, no seats, and loud Prices are on the expensive side but almost all patisserie are like that. I was a bit disappointed by the colors of the macaroons... They look too artificial. Too bright. ! Yes They are pretty on pictures but didn't really make my mouth water. I would have loved it it was more pastel tone... to make it look like it has natural colorings. Other desserts they were well designed and looked amazing... although some of them I didn't really understand the color contrast.if they do... they didn't really do a good job on keeping it fresh because one of the dessert looked a bit dry. And I don't know if they bake their desserts fresh everyday or not but I also loved their packaging! Pink boxes!!! So pretty!!! Macaroons... I got one of each flavors they had... Macha was my favorite deep macha flavouring was just overwhelmingly amazing!! I liked Louie's macaroons because they weren't too sweet. But the texture they can improve on. Overall did I like Louie yes! would I go back? probably.

BL feels very much like an amusement park.  Lines everywhere, tourist looking like people, and overpriced sweets.  The sad thing is that I find myself still flocking to amusement parks because they are fun, hence why I can handle BL. On a Saturday evening (8:30pm), I can describe the place as sheer madness.  I feel like they need signs to instruct people on what they are doing and where to go.  I had to pull aside a waiter to get instructions on what each line and seating place was for. The flock of people just waiting around are the vultures.  They are on the prowl for anyone looking like they are about to finish their meal.  Beware, they will strike and they leave no mercy.  They only wander in the "first come, first serve" section at the front of the restaurant.   If you are lucky to find the table with The Book at the center of the establishment, you can find the hostess who will flip through dozens of pages until she reaches the last page and puts your name down.  Wait time- estimated 2 hours.  They also note what you look like so they can hunt you down.  I have to give them props for they were able to find me after 2 hours and ... many drinks. The back area of the restaurant is reserved for those who were chosen from The Book.  The menu is the same from the front to the back, the only difference is that you don't need to fear for your life from the vultures.   Anywhere you make it, if you do, the menu is simple and caters to everyone.  The food is not heavy and everything is pretty good.  I was a little disappointed with the macarons at $2.00 a piece.  They were on the drier side and not worth $2.00.  They are definitely a novelty as people were buying them like they were gold.

Super trendy, warehouse feel but this place literally is one of the best places in fact a must go to in LA. I thought for an italian restaurant everything we tried was done delicious! As busy as they were Valentines day night and I'm sure many nights, we had the nicest and most attentive server who even stuck around our table and chatted a bit! I had the stone IPA on draft which is always great, the artichoke pizza and the mussels that tasted extremely fresh! There is a whole lot of energy and life around here which makes it a great place to be downtown! Needless to say it isn't quiet and sometimes that is a great thing! So many good food choices and especially if you're an adventurous eater it's a great place to try and enjoy something new! I really enjoyed the Macaroons as well, which sell really quick but for good reason! They taste perfect! I also really enjoyed our pizza which was made literally right next to us! All the ingredients tasted fresh and the fresh mozzarella was amazing! I feel like you could have put any combination of meats and veggies on this pizza and it would have tasted amazing! Lots of parking around to, but don't count on finding street parking, either valet or a structure with a flat fee which wasn't too bad either! Overall I would most definitely come back!

This place is just a waste of your time n money. I came here for my birthday and got the worst service ever. I had to order everything twice and half of the thing were not cooked properly. The bruchetta had burnt bread. Pizza had no taste and bland, it had very little toppings. Pasta was cold when they served it. The drinks were good, but we had to wait 30 mins for them and remind them twice about or order. And all this after we complained to the manager about the service in the beginning when we didn't get any server for over 15 mins.

Love their sweets and amazing coffee. I've been there for breakfast and I've enjoyed every dish, specially their eggs benedict. I was there once for brunch and it was not a good experience mainly because of the service, the waiter even apologized, stating "this is the worse time to come" but the pizza we ordered was still good but not delicious.  Have yet to try their dinner....to be continued until then I guess.

I've only been here for the macaroons. They are mouthwatering delicious but a little costly given their size. You get 5 for about $10.00, which could break your bank if you came here every day/week. However, I'm not in the area often, so when I am around Bottega I do get a small box and it doesn't hurt my bank account. The macaroons are a must and their pastry section is so cute. I can't wait to try their food one day.

The desserts are very delicious( only been here just for the desserts) a bit pricey but there defiantly worth it ! The ugly part is that parking is bad, and there employees lack in customer service, I'm not asking for them to smile at me and be kissing my @$$ but at least have a little more of a positive attitude towards your customers.

Mache salad - not my favorite, it was really tart. Lasagna - yummy, but not worth the $ Portobello fries - yummy, but again not worth the $ Eggs benedict - I've had better.  It lacked flavor and I'm pretty sure there was a piece of egg shell in there somewhere. Potato pancakes - I enjoyed this appetizer.  You eat it with apple sauce and sour cream and the salty/sweet flavor worked really well together.   Parking isn't a problem.  There is a lot right next to it and plenty of metered parking.  Expect a wait, but coming earlier during meals might decrease your wait time.  Ambiance, like everyone else has stated, is beautiful and service was great. The desserts are really pretty and taste good too.  But overall, I wouldn't come here for the food, just the desserts.

Brunch brunch brunch- My favorite meal.   Over 5,000 reviews, always packed and smells amazing.   Wait is never too too long and you can usually get a self seated table pretty quickly in their bistro area near the bar. Typical no fail order: Beignets: Fresh, warm, light- served with the best raspberry compote ever made Lobster Hash:  Self explainably amazing and perfect Really, go ahead an order anything off of their breakfast menu. This is a sure way to start a perfect Sunday funday :)

Bottega Louis, I kind of have a love/hate relationship with this place. Don't get me wrong i mean the food is good and delicious but... you're like romantic comedy that i only have to watch if my friends force me and drag me along. you're good but you're not my first choice. If i had to eat here more than once every 2 month, I would yak just like how i would yak if i kept watching romantic comedies... Anyways, I like your food tho Louis... i really do. Actually, nevermind. I'm okay about your food. i just like your desserts (: that's why I'm giving you four stars LOLOL. your chocolate souffle and macaroons are the only things preventing you from being mediocre.

This place is legit. Overcrowded borderline upscale east coast style eatery/bakery. Service is on point. Nice ambiance for lunch. It is pretty loud in here so not exactly a great date spot. The food is delicious! Parking is a pain but if you know downtown, you know that! Desserts are about 8-10$ each but they look as delectable as can be. We ordered salads, pizza, lasagna, and a few side dishes. They were all great. The ingredients were so FRESH. Pizzas are 20, Salads 10-12, Dishes range from 15-40. No complaints. I will definitely return! This place is nothing extraordinary but its a gem considering the other italian options in the area.

They have such great eggs benedict. It comes with salmon and sits a top a potato pancake. I can taste it now. The atmosphere is very lively and there is never a dull moment. It's definitely a place to go and people watch. Now, about the bakery. It is very apparent that they copied Laduree's (can be found in Paris and now in NYC) business model. Their packaging looks very similar although I still found it beautiful. I will say this....Their display's are better looking than their desserts are. I bought macaroons and a cupcake. The cupcake was very small and it was okay, but Dot's is much better. The macaroons tasted a little old. They weren't as soft as they should be and they are way too expensive for what I got. Go for the food and the experience, not the bakery.

Wow!!! I would eat here a couple times a month if I lived in LA. 11:45 on a Friday we were seated right away for lunch. We shared the Porchetta sandwich and Mediterranean  muscles. I think if the muscles came out first I'd have higher marks for them but the Porcetta hit a grand slam! This should be a one of America's best sandwiches. In addition service and  ambiance were amazing, top notch! Lunch was followed by  a few treats at their pasteria that were amazing as well :)

What kind of witchcraft do they put in their macaroons? I had the lavender macaroons and it caused me to put it down and just look at it because I couldn't believe that they managed to cram so much flavor in such a delicate looking package. Usually I would file a macaroon under "too cute to eat" but let's keep it real. I ate that macaroon up. Oh yes I did.

I discovered this place on a whim. A friend of mine lives in one of the high-rises nearby, and I always noticed this spot was busy so I vowed to try it at some point. I was glad I finally did. It's located in a good spot downtown, and close to the metro if you ever ride it. I love the atmosphere. It's almost elegant with the all white decor. It's always lively and upbeat. Although loud at times, it is still an enjoyable dining experience. Here is what I have tried... -Soups-The onion gratinee and tomato soup are awesome. Tomato basil has always been a favorite of mine and BL does not disappoint. -Starters-The portobello fries are a must try. So good. I also tried the meatballs. While good, I was not overly impressed. -Main dishes-The pizzas are very good. I recommend the Napoli. All the ingredients are fresh and taste authentic. I have also tried the lasagna, which tasted like it was homemade from scratch. Very tasty. -Desserts-BL does not disappoint in the dessert department. The peanut butter terrine is to die for. The creme brulee and macaroons are also up there. They also have a full bar and decent wine list. Overall I really enjoy coming here. The atmosphere is great and the food is tasty. Decent priced as well.

3 stars for the food, 1 extra for the ambience. It feels like you are truly in a bustling, French eatery! The wait was an hour but I certainly did not mind staring at the all the delicious desserts in the bakery in the front. It' s $2 per macaron and I got once of each of the 13 flavors! I can't wait to come back here to drink mimosas! I ordered the melon juice, eggs benedict, and the Portobello fries... was good but lacked flavor. The pepperoni pizza and italian scramble were just "eh." The service was very good and the place is beautiful! Found lot parking for $5!

So this place is teetering between a stars rating for me so maybe I need to break up the pros and cons to decide. Neighborhood: +1 Great downtown area. Lots of things to do and see and BEST of all its easily accessible by the Metro lines!!! SCORE. Any place that can be reached via the metro lines is a winner in my eyes. That means no need to wait in traffic and look around to find parking in this downtown location. Ambience: +1 FANCY. Very nice décor! Really loved the whole vibe to the place. Its busy and noisy and chaotic but the scenery is breathtaking. You really feel like you're in Italy or somewhere exotic. Loved the whole vibe. Food: +1 Portobello fries were on POINT. Nice and salty and crispy. They aren't mushrooms atop of fries like some at the table thought yet they are thick cut mushrooms battered and fried. I'm a HUGE mushroom fan so loved every bit of it. -1 Trenne (Pan sautéed trenne pasta with braised prime rib eye, Tuscan black kale & shaved Grana parmesan) Liked the kale and rib but HATED HATED HATED the trenne. When I saw pan sautéed I didn't think my pasta was gonna be hard and crunchy. It wasn't an appetizing taste. It really wasn't worth the price nor something that I would get again. Skip it. Move on! Service: +1 Despite the hostess in the unreasonably short dress, I felt like the service was great considering this place is a buzzing wasps nest. Its so busy and chaotic, I give props to whatever waiter can hack it in these conditions. BRAVO Overall Experience: +1Really nice place to have a birthday dinner or lunch with the ladies. Sophisticated, classy and charming. Just steer clear of the Trenne!

First off this place is gorgeous! Secondly, their pastries are as yummy as they are beautiful which is insane because everything is like a work of art there! Seriously be prepared to spend extra time at the gym after coming here for dessert but trust me it'll be we'll worth it! But bringing it back down...to me Bottega Louie would be a 5 star bakery/cafe, but as a restaurant I give it a 3. I find the menu items to be overpriced for what they are y frankly a lot of diners in la do them just as well for much less.

I love the hustle and bustle of Bottega Louie. The food is very high quality and appetizing. I loved their portobello fries! The texture was what I loved. It was both crunchy and soft at the same time. I've been here both during the day and at night. Totally different experiences. The day time is a lot more relaxing and leisure. At night it gets a little cray cray in here. People stand waiting next to the table that you're dining at while they wait. I don't know how this isn't a fire hazard...  But that's what makes the atmosphere fun. It definitely gets packed and there is a wait. It's one of the things in LA to check out if you want the "LA" dining experience. Good place to bring a date. It's a fun, trendy spot to get dinner. My favorite thing about this place has got to be their macarons! Delicious. The best I've ever had! My favorite is the green tea and second to that is the salted caramel. These little puppies are perfection! The flavors stay true to their description which isn't always the case with macarons.

I've been here for lunch and dinner and haven't really been blown away. I know there are many great reviews, but I haven't encountered that wonderful experience here just yet. Maybe in time. The atmosphere is really interesting. It's classy, casual, and chic. Definitely an LA hotspot. A majority of the staff look like models, actors, and actresses. I wouldn't be surprised if that's what they're aspiring to be. I only remember my lunch server who was a really polite and cordial young lady. I noticed she plastered a smile on before she approached any table, so at least she had the courtesy of doing that. They tend to be really busy most hours, but the servers are still as prompt as possible; especially, when they're refilling your water. They do it so fast, you barely notice! The food I've had hasn't really made an impression on me. I ordered the pepperoni pizza at lunch. Pretty basic, right? It was undercooked. But I could tell it had potential if it were to be cooked all the way. I wasn't in the mood to complain, so I didn't Lastly, I'm not the biggest fan of the fad food, macaroons, but I'm all for second chances, so I always at least try one macaroon at different places. This time around, I tried the SALTED CARAMEL and...it was THE BEST MACAROON EVER! (GAH-DAYUM!) So if you get the chance, try that one.

At our table we had pepperoni pizza(kids), lasagna, salad with pears, pasta with clams, pasta with prawns and  2 desserts. We ordered cocktails and the waitress forgot to put in our order. Nor did she check on us often enough to know that. We didn't get out drinks till we were almost done with our entrees. Also disappointed that they were not compensated for after the fact. Prawns in pasta were NOT cleaned well--some had the full vein--which, for $16 a plate, is unacceptable. Other dishes were good, not great. Tiramisu and macaroons were ordered for dessert. Tiramisu wasn't eaten. Real tiramisu is silky and creamy and soft as clouds...theirs was not. It was too dense and more like regular cake than tiramisu. It was also way too sweet. Macaroons were decent. Sorry Bottega Louie, we won't be coming back.

Wow, what a great place to have lunch! We came in here in the middle of the week in the late afternoon so there wasn't any wait. First off, the dining hall looks pretty nice! The bakery has an assortment of macarons that are just sooo tempting! The waiters and waitresses really did look SUPERB! They were friendly and kept good care of us! The pizza is A++++! We had half a burrata pizza and half a sausage pizza. The sausage pizza was good but wasn't really special. The burrata was AMAZING! The prosciutto just adds a delectable touch! The portobello fries were the star of this meal. Who knew sliced up and fried up mushrooms could be so delicious?! The Parmesan and the dip provided really just topped everything off. The fettucine belmondo was alright. It wasn't great but it wasn't bad. It's not really anything special so I wouldn't recommend getting it unless you're really craving a pasta dish. If you're dining in for lunch, remember to ask for bread and butter! Bread is only offered by request for lunch hours!

Come early for dinner if you can!  I've always had their desserts and would take it to-go whenever I was in DTLA but I just had to experience dining there for dinner!  Came on a Saturday night a few weeks ago with another couple.  We arrived around 6-6:30pm and there was about a 30-minute wait which was doable.  While you wait you can drool over the desserts on display or watch the people in the kitchen preparing the meals. Once seated our server came quickly to take our drink orders.  So many options for water!  ;P  Complimentary, distilled, sparkling, oh my!  You also get bread and butter while you wait.  I'd skip the bread, it was pretty hard to chew.  We ordered the portobello mushroom fries to share among the 4 of us.  It was good!  I wish we didn't share though because I could have had more, honestly. My boyfriend and I shared the Margherita pizza.  It was made just right.  If you like thin crust pizzas then this is the place for you.  For dessert, we had their famous macarons to-go.  Each flavor is worth trying!  I haven't tasted all of them yet but I know I'll be back to try more!  The most underrated dessert is the hazelnut beignet!  Sooooooo delicious!  You MUST try that too! I like the ambience very much!  Like other yelpers said, it can get loud.  But I like that it's a candle-lit type of dinner place - intimate and romantic.  Perfect for a first date! I would recommend this place and will be back.  :)

Must haves: Macaroons (my favorite is the vanilla), White chocolate covered pretzels (don't underestimate these!) and raspberry filled beignets (bold raspberry flavor)... all truly special. We also came in for breakfast; the service was lovely. I really felt taken care of and attended to by all the staff. I didn't order anything special, a farmer's style breakfast. The ambience is so beautiful and clean, I loved just being there taking it all in. This is definitely an LA must-do (so it's trendy, you'll never be the only one there), just for my must haves list. It's pricey, but soooo worth it.

Best macaroons I've ever had. Everytime I'm in the LA area, I make sure I stop by Bottega! They're so detail oriented with their presentations and everything just looks so professional and delicious. From the moment you walk in and notice the high ceiling with the classy and modern architecture inside, it just makes you feel good. The staff is exquisitely dressed, and look better than the majority of the patrons. The wait can be pretty long but if you tough it out, you'll be treated to a very fine dining experience. While you're waiting, hit up the bar for some cocktails, mimosa or bellini to pass the time. I've been here for brunch and dinner and I definitely prefer the brunch menu more. I would recommend trying the lobster hash and the smoked salmon eggs benedict, as both have eggs that are cooked to absolute perfection. The wait staff is very fast and attentive to your needs and even in a packed house, they make you feel special and bring the food out in a very timely manner. After your delicious meal, make sure to stop by the macaroon case and pick up a box of different varieties of your choosing. You'll get some delicious desserts, a fancy box and should your heart desire, a ribbon tied around it! It serves as a perfect gift, if you can resist not eating them on the way home!

**It's like you ***see bright lights *and hear angels **singing as you ****open the doors ***** to Bottega Louie. When you are first walk in you are swallowed by the awesome white cavern.  Streams of color draw your gaze over to the glass cases filled with colorful desserts.  You walk in and wonder,  is it a bakery?  Is it a restaurant?  Where am I?  Is this the right place? Finally, you see the host desk and walk over to begin your dining experience. We went with some out of towners.  A few newbies, a nine year old kid and a couple of Valley girls.  Here's what everyone indulged themselves with:   Pancetta & Burrata scramble Eggs Benedict Smoked Salmon Benedict Breakfast Flatbread French Toast Salmon Millefeuille Orange Juice, Apple Juice, Latte (NOTE:  juices are FRESH squeezed, they start to turn color if you let them sit for too long....it was a little....ooogie) Macaroons - Salted Caramel, Vanilla, Red Velvet Beignets Cheesecake Key Lime Pie Everyone was satisfied with their meal, though no one was ecstatic. The food was definitely made better by the atmosphere.   Parking in downtown is a bitch and a will cost you an arm and a leg...maybe even a spleen (thank goodness you don't really need that one.).  We went on the weekend so it wasn't THAT bad.  There's a lot just a building over from the restaurant on Broadway.  On this day,  at  11 am in the morning, it was $5 to park.   Oh, one last item.  I am restroom phobic.  These were impeccable.  I'd use them again.

This place was SUPER delicious. My bf and I came in for the first time and it was for brunch and it was packed. It was a little confusing. The bakery portion is in the front and the bar is in the middle and the hostess table is towards the back and in between is a mass of packed tables. No one is really their to direct you so i take of a star for that. Might have a bit better crowd control if they had the hostess table in the front near the entrance like a regular establishment. Luckily... my bf and I just sat at the bar where we were served food as well. It was a smart choice considering the crowd. Food and Drink: Salmon eggs benedict on a potato pancake... phenomenal. The bloody mary's were one of the best. Delicious! TIP: Try a macaron. They're $2 a piece and even if youre just cruising by for a meal, the macarons are AMAZING! Try the Earl Grey ones and the Violet flavored ones (the blue and the purple) the flavors sound weird but the taste is divine!

I've been wanting to eat here for a long time and I'm glad I got to try it on Valentine's Day. The food was very delicious. - Portebello Fries - Prosciutto and Fruit - Shrimp Scampi - Stuffed Quail - Chocolate Souffle The portebello fries is a staple and some kind of wonderful. Probably my favorite part of our entire meal. I liked the mix of prosciutto and fruit, the fruit was fresh and went well with the meat. I absolutely loved the scampi and tried not to inhale it as fast as I could. My boyfriend had the stuffed quail and thought it was great. The chocolate souffle was delicious, but we should've ordered it early. We completely forgot about the preparation necessary for souffles but it was worth the wait. As far as the macarons go, we've had better. They're very good but I wasn't as impressed as I was by the entrees. This is definitely a place to try again. I'm gonna have to try their pizza or pasta because looking around at the other patrons' food made me wanting more. And a shout out to our great waiter, Bannon (Banon? Sorry with the spelling). He was very nice and accommodating to us and provided us some great service!

Bring me a box of macarons so I know it's real (whatever "it" is) Top 3 favorite macarons thus far. Came on a Friday, ate all the macarons by Saturday. Craved more by Sunday, luckily got another fix on Monday. I sound like a crack addict. But their macarons really are delicious. I particularly love the salted caramel which I feel I could fill a box of, but then it wouldn't look so pretty and colorful :( Price is pretty average to other macaron shops. Doesn't hurt that this place is filled with attractive people. Although, I did wish they validated parking. But not many places do in downtown LA.  I'd walk here, if that meant I had an extra $5 to spend on macarons instead of parking.

We arrived at Bottega Louie at 5:30 pm on a Tuesday and was seated immediately by the friendly host.  Our server Tyler was also very friendly and efficient, as were the busboys.  The dining room was already half-full at this time and was completely full by the time we left just before 7 pm. We started with small plates of Grilled Octopus and Diver Scallops, both of which were perfectly cooked and tender.  Then we had entrees of Ceppo Gamber (jumbo shrimp and ceppo pasta) and the Roasted Cod   Both were delicious! For dessert, we ordered the Chocolate Souffle (which Tyler recommended allowing 20 minutes to prepare) and a selection of 4 pieces of their famous Macarons.  The souffle was perfectly baked and oh-so-scrumptious!  The macarons were also delicious and the freshly brewed coffee was the perfect complement. We really enjoyed Bottega Louie and will return to try some of their other menu choices, like pizzas and pasta dishes. As others have mentioned, however, the noise level is off the charts loud, so don't expect soft music or quiet conversations here...

This place is, quite frankly, pretty overrated in my opinion.  The food is decent and admittedly well-priced, but there's nothing on the menu that's particularly noteworthy.  The façade of the restaurant is nice enough but the fancy high ceilings of the interior produces an echo that make it damn well near impossible to have a conversation with someone.  As far as the patisserie goes, the macarons, though pretty to look at, utterly pale in comparison to Ladurée who they are flagrantly trying to mimic (for better macarons in the LA area, try Europane).  Given the wait and parking situation, there's no reason for me to be coming back of my own accord.

I was here a while ago but I definitely remember some key things: Skirt Steak was great. Mushroom Fries make me salivate like a dog in Pavlov's studies each time I think abou them. Service was awesome. Arugula salad was tangy and delicious and inspired to make tangy and delicious arugula salad at home ever since...although it doesnt actually come out as tangy and delicious as Bottega Louie. Drinks at the bar while waiting for a table is a great way to get your customers to like you better even if you make them wait. Macaroons.

This 2-star is for desserts and bread only. The macarrons are not consistent. Recently, they have been serving macarrons that are hard. This is because they come right from the fridge. There is no enough time for the macarrons sit at a specific temperature for enough time. The staff just recommended everything. Not really helpful..... The baguette was not great at all either. :(

Okay, let's start with the good. The macarons have rightfully earned their reputations. Deliciously sweet, aesthetically pleasing and cleverly packaged these pastries are worth the ridiculous line and pushy crowd. I also adore the ambiance of this place, it has a classy yet hip feel to it. Now for the bad. The food itself was underwhelming as the disparity in price and taste left us wishing we left with just macarons. The pizza took ages and was not worth the 20 dollar price tag .The clam linguine was bland and boring. And to top it all of our server was way too pushy, clearly the management makes it an important point to upsell to a level of discomfort for the diners... Overall, my positive feelings for this place stopped after a glass of wine and a small pastry. I could have done without the crazy, relentless crowd, pricey bill and over-the-top wait service.

Did I have a macaroon? Why, yes. Was it the best macaroon ever? Why, yes, it was! Did I feel a little guilty spending $2 per cookie when an emaciated homeless man stood begging right outside the door? No, I felt a lot guilty. So I gave him the other flavor I got. I will never know how the vanilla flavor tastes, so ask him if you need to know. You can't go wrong with the salted caramel, though. (end report)

I'm super late, but I FINALLY got to dine here and try their infamous portobello fries! The day was Friday, and knowing the lines get really long, we arrived at 5:30. Even then, there were two parties in front of us and the restaurant was packed. We were a party of 8. When we got seated, the menu and drinks were given promptly. All I have to say is, our waiter Joel, was amazing! He got us started with the portobello fries, and I have to admit, I was a little skeptic about the hype. It seemed like some people loved it, while some didn't think it was up to par. Well..I thought it was amazing! Especially the aioli sauce..I'm drooling. It doesn't even taste like mushroom. As for the main dishes we got: -lasagna -orecchiette -caesar salad -salmon -1/2 burrata 1/2 mushroom -1/2 mushroom 1/2 artichoke -fettuccine belmundo -spaghetti pomodoro Everyone was satisfied with their dish. Mine was the 1/2 burrata 1/2 mushroom pizza, and I enjoyed it alot. The crust was perfect, I liked the mushroom more, because the rapini on the burrata was a little much for me. The pizza is huge, so I'm sure it'll be enough to share with 2 if not 3 people. The tomato sauce on the lasagna was delicious, as well as the salmon being cooked to perfection. Our glasses never had time to be empty, as they were constantly being refilled by the waiters. When some people in the party went to the restroom, Joel even folded their napkins and placed them on the table again. After our meal, we went over to the bakery for the best part, macarons! My favorite was the earl grey, but they're all delicious and beautiful. I can just look at the desserts all day. I'll have to come back to try their pistachio saint honore.

I have nothing but positive things to say about Bottega Louie. I ordered the Chicken Carciofi as my entree and i was extremely satisfied with my choice.  Very flavorful and appetizing.  I recommend the Moulin Rouge cocktail for $12.00 which is absolutely delicious.  Ben was the server on this particular Monday night when I was there and delivered positively outrageous customer service all the way!!  He was very attentive and professional and tended to our every need.  The Chocolate Souffle dessert was simply mouthwatering.  I highly recommend purchasing some delectable Macaroons from the front counter before leaving this restaurant...they are well worth it!! many flavors to choose from.  Yummy!!

One of the Bests & I were slated to grace downtown L.A. with our presence for the Maroon 5 concert & someone highly recommended Bottega Louie for brunch the morning after. I woke up sort of bright-eyed & moderately bushy-tailed, ready to get my Bottega Louie on. Breakfast is, afterall, the most important meal of the day! I moseyed into the bathroom... no. hot. water. The Best thinks I'm nuts & don't know how to use the sink that I'd just used 8hrs earlier. So, she goes to get in the shower... no. hot. water. I called the front desk & was told the hot water was out for the entire hotel. She asked "were you trying to leave to go somewhere?" (maybe it's just me but that was a stupid question!) I told her "yes, we're trying to go have breakfast!" They offered to bring us breakfast in the room but that was simply unacceptable. Dedicated to the cause, we freshened up the best that we could & skipped out of the hotel & took our 9min walk thru the streets of downtown L.A. to Bottega Louie. We got there just after 9a, when they open. The host (& someone who later appeared to be a hostess?) looked freshly showered yet somehow not as stoked as we were to be there. We were seated then greeted by a very pleasant waiter. We started with a coffee for the Best & a cafe latte for me. The latte came with a heart in the foam... after a few sips, I couldn't help but think "why, thank you, I heart you too." The Best kept asking herself where they get their coffee & rubbing her tummy in approval. It didn't take us long to decide what we wanted... it was harder deciding what we DIDN'T want. I was ready to ask for the plate measurements to see exactly how many things could fit on the table. We both ordered the french toast (we later agreed that one of us should have ordered the suggested lemon ricotta pancakes with blueberry syrup to maximize on the experience), the roasted potatoes & the prosciutto & burrata. The french toast was perfectly prepared but, rather than the berry compote stated on the menu, it came with mixed berries. The roasted potatoes were unlike any I've ever had. The flavor was mind-blowing & they were sooo creamy inside. The prosciutto & burrata (& the potato pancake they came on) was incredible. The prosciutto melted in our mouths. While waiting for our food, being that we were seated right by the kitchen, we saw plates of beignets (with raspberry dipping sauce) being prepared. We were smart enough to know better than to try to conquer them during brunch but also smart enough to get an order to-go. While waiting for our bill, our neighbors had their food delivered... her eggs benedict looked like perfection... he marveled at his dish & could say nothing more than "wow." I totally understood the sentiment. Once you eat there, you will too. I have been out of the Yelp game for a while but declared that maybe all I needed was the inspiration to get back in it. All I needed was Bottega Louie! Both the patisserie & the restaurant are very spacious & started to fill up by 10a. I loved the open kitchen; it was a sensory delight. I easily could have sat back & spent the morning in our corner booth without a care in the world. This was definitely our favorite breakfast experience ever & we'll be forever thankful to the person who recommended it. I hope Bottega Louie is around for many, many years... I'll even wish upon a star that one is opened in Vegas someday!

Finally got to dine here! Had their macarons plenty of time, but I wanted a MEAL. So I went with a girl friend during a Saturday morning/noon for brunch, because I had my eye on the smoked salmon eggs benedict. Well, when we first got there, it was PACKED. The whole area was crowded and filled with people literally everywhere. It was kinda messy and I figured we were gonna have to wait for at least an hour. They don't take reservations either. So we went up to the host and hostess who told us it'll be a 20-25 minute wait. Not bad. But TEN minutes later, they found us and told us our table was ready. HUZZAH! So we got seated, got our complimentary flat water (lol) and ordered the portobello fries to start. I had the smoked salmon eggs benedict, and my homegirl had the egg whites somethin somethin. I tried her dish, it was whatevs. I like egg yolks way more than egg whites. But anyway, the smoked salmon eggs benedict were bomb! I like the smoked salmon, I think it's a good way to eat eggs benedict instead of with ham or Canadian bacon or whatever. Smokey, tasty, runny-yolky, and the hollandaise sauce was on point. The portobello fries though. We both agreed that was the highlight of the meal. The aioli it came with was DEEELICIOUSSSS. I loved loved loved it. So much. I could just order that for myself next time. Wouldn't regret it.

I parked at One Wilshire after hours for $5.  It's a pretty short walk to this restaurant.  Surprisingly there was no wait for my part of 2 on a Friday night.  If you do need to wait, though, you can occupy yourself with checking out all the desserts.  Our server was pretty friendly and checked in often.   We had the $20 mushroom and artichoke pizza (reading the reviews, it seems like it used to be only $18).  What I like is that we were able to have half of the pizza with mushrooms and the other half as artichoke.  The pizza was good.  The crust was pretty hard.  Speaking of crust, the bread they handed out was also pretty hard. We also ordered two "small plates" which were not that small at all - the fried calamari and the mussels.  The calamari, when dipped, was good (must be the sauce) but it wasn't anything to go crazy about.  Lots of batter.  The mussels were delicious and didn't have any awkward taste (you know, when things aren't so fresh). There were free refills on the Arnold Palmer! It does get loud in there so I wouldn't go here for a romantic night out.  But it's a nice place to hang out and relax after a long day at work.

Loved the ambiance and look and feel of the place...as well as the food.  Can't wait to have dinner there. Came in for lunch and had to wait roughly 20 minutes to get seated; but it's okay because it gave us time to get in line and order some macarons for ourselves and for our family to enjoy.   Macarons: Definitely one of the best i've tasted, and the flavors are pretty diverse - they're not too sweet, which is why I like them so much, but buyer beware, they're $2 a  pop.  We spent more than $50 on ours. Brunch/Lunch Menu - Not to diverse, the dinner definitely has a wider spread.  But we had a half/half pizza, the procuitto one and the one w/ arugula, pretty good.  Also had the ravioli small plate, which is indeed small, you just get one large ravioli.  And also had the portabello(sp) fries; which were definitely the highlight of our meal, along with the beignets of course!   One cool thing I forgot to mention is that when you're waiting and put your name down on the waitlist, they jot down what you look like so they actually come find you when your table is ready, I thought that was awesome. Parking - Well, you're in downtown, the spot is on the corner, so hopefully you can get lucky finding street parking, but there are a bunch of paid lots around that vary in range from $4 to $10.   DEFINITELY a very VERY popular place, hence the 5k reviews...so it probably doesn't matter when you come, you just gotta be ready to wait.  It was a great experience tho, and we're definitely coming back!

Went with a group of about 10. They took about 30 minutes to seat us, though i dont recall if we had reservations or not. Ambiance: It is immensely beautiful. Looks like a big grand hall, dimmed lights with candles, tables set out everywhere. Very romantic, Buzz noise from food utensils and people talking. Great for a date. Service: It was okay. Not the best. The hostesses were all chit chatting and messing around while people that came in seemed to want to put their name down for a table. Our server must of been in a bad mood cause she was fake smiling us, taking our order forcefully. Not cute, sweetheart!! We had to ask a couple of times for refills and more bread, something that as a server, should be on top of. (i've been a server, so i know) Food: I ordered lasagna. Super bland. My grandmother can make better that that. Maybe I just happened to order something so common, that I wasn't impressed. It seriously tasted like stoffer's frozen lasagna with a fancy piece of basil on top. Fried calamari was delish! Chocolate souffle was delicious but not worth it's 15 bux. You're paying for the location, location, location.

What a gem of a place in downtown LA. Right when you walk in, you're greeted by a stunning rainbow of macarons. What a visual feast. I could not stop staring and yes, taking pictures of their displays. My girlfriends and I went for brunch on Super Bowl Sunday, and the place was still packed. We walked in and were told there was no wait to be seated... but then we were asked if our entire party was here (my friend was parking), and so we had to wait until she arrived. I got nervous because the line at the hostess table started piling up, yet they kindly seated us right away when we walked up and they saw our name way up on the list. The clientele is a mix of hipsters and fashionistas, smartly dressed... trendy yet oh so effortlessly casual. The interior is all white, with high ceilings, and huge windows... no drapes or partitions to absorb the noise, so it is very noisy. It can get challenging to have a conversation. But to the food... Portabello mushroom fries and beignets to start. And oh, what a start! I could have left happy after all that fried goodness. But then came the lemon ricotta pancakes and lobster hash. Both delicious (if you're like me and have trouble deciding between savory and sweet). Would love to come back and try their pizzas.

I had very high expectations when coming here because of all the great reviews and all the rave about their macaroons from all of my friends... It was disappointing but then again it might be that I prefer less sweet macaroons. Their macaroons were super sweet and a bit overwhelming. I got the pistachio, either coffee or mocha (I forget), and vanilla. My favorite one was the coffee macaroon simply because it wasn't as sweet as the other ones. I haven't tried their food yet but I do have pretty high expectations of their food. Interior is nice and clean but definitely not like a normal sit down restaurant. Parking is a challenge. I was lucky enough to find street parking but it is hard to find so I suggest valet parking if anything.

Don't expect to visit the place quickly for a late dinner. Although I'd consider this one of my favorite spots in LA...one time we had to eat dinner at midnight because of the long wait. Luckily they have very yummy drinks and a little bit of seating that you can hang around in until your table is called. As soon as you put your name in, I'd recommend grabbing a fresh ginger cocktail at the bar. For some reason I thought the lunches were over priced but the dinners seemed reasonable for the quality of food and type of establishment. I have been happy here each time I have gone!

It is all lunch specialist for its Delicious Mongolian beef and hot and sour soup. I never imagined that any food could be so tasty lie this. I should offer thanks to its owner and chief for providing me such delicious food. Next time coming back with all of my friends to offer same taste.

I must first start this review by saying that the service at Bottega Louie is unmatched! Simply amazing! I was never low on sparkling water, wine, butter, napkins, you name it, they were on it! They were the epitome of class and professionalism. We only waited about 30 minutes (mind you it was a Friday night at 8:35pm) and I called ahead to try and make a reservation (they don't take reservations) so when I asked the appoximate wait time they estimated over an hour. So 30 minutes was great. We purchased macarons from the bakery (5 for $10 and wrapped in a pretty box) and they are delectable. We drank the house cab (superb) and ate the Napoli pizza (delish!). I couldn't have had a better experience. We can't wait to come back!

Appetizer: Portobello Mushroom fries with basil aioli = I don't even like fancy mayonnaise and I was devouring the fries with the dipping sauce. Small dishes: Diver scallops - two large scallops on a bed of black lentils and pesto sauce were amazing. Grilled Octopus - coupled with tiny potatoes that I'm sure have a fancy name and some other stuff that looked like Bok Choy was absolutely mouth watering. Pizza: Artichoke - damn good Entrees: Hanger steak verdura - medium grilled steak topped with baby carrots, mushrooms, green beans, and onions was just the right amount of juicy ... and I'm not a fan of red meat. Dessert: Chocolate souffle - recommended by the waitress - it was really good and absolutely well presented - kudos to the waitress. Tartlettes - we bought blackberry tartlettes while we waited. scrumptious. Wine: We purchased a bottle of Pinot Blanc at the front while we were waiting for our table. No corkage fee for the first bottle, $15 dollars corkage per bottle after that. Service: Though there is a wait, even on a slow night, the wait staff is very nice and personable. Two cents: Skip the entree and go straight to the pizza and opt for the small dishes.

Probably one of the most overrated restaurants in LA! Macarons and other goodies are delicious, eye catching and deliberately decorated at the entrance but their food don't live up to the hype or the reputation. I've had better pizzas and pastas elsewhere, probably more than half the occasion. But it's still passable because the ambience, spacious interior of the restaurant pull you in. You could see busy LA downtown through big windows. Definitely a place to bring your friends that are visiting LA but not a weekly dining spot. On a side note, the wait can be ridiculously long on weekends and gets very noisy during dinner time. Deserts - Good Food - Fair / mediocre

Great food and a sophisticated Euro vibe. Eat the pizza in the first few minutes it's out of the oven and you're in for treat. Roasted brussel sprouts and pistachios? Charred asparagus with a poached egg and parmesan? Fantastic! The dishes show an attention to detail that is remarkable for such a big, busy joint. Sorry if I don't describe what people were wearing, I'm working on being more shallow. Fun spot with good food though!

fancy portions with good quality is worth the dollar bills you spend! Try the Pomodoro! It is fried penne pasta with the most tender meat. My favorite!! The sauce is this light tasty sauce. The ambiance is pretty loud so i dont think its too much of a great date place, or a place to do a lunch business meeting or talk about anything important.. Because you'll basically have be screaming at the other person.. Unless you're sitting really close.. which is also awkward. If you're eating for two and want to try this place, order a pizza(~$15), pasta(~$25), and appetizer (get mushroom fries ~$9) to share--their pizza is pretty large. Your bill will be like ~$50ish that way, and you will have left overs from your pizza ;). Tip--If you have no time to wait and you are eating with a party of two, just eat on the small round tables near the bar and pastry area. Those tables are whoever finds a free table. Try a beignet donut with Nutella! Absolutely one of the most delicious donuts ever. I come here after my lunch meal just for desserts sometimes. I like their rosé cupcake and beignets. They use to have cute little macaroons on their cupcakes but they got rid of that :'(. The service is as good as a busy restaurant gets. They are friendly and try to be as attentive as they can be. i kinda dislike how loud it is. the restaurant looks nice though.

I just really really like this place. It's a girly girl's dream to be inside of this restaurant (although I don't necessarily classify myself as a girly girl). From the pastel colors and rows of pastries to the absolutely breath-taking decor and high ceilings, I just can't get enough! Now, you can't forget that just because you feel like you've been transported to Paris temporarily that you're not actually still in downtown L.A. Parking still sucks. I ended up parking in a lot that charged $5 for a whole day around the corner from the restaurant. It was well worth it, in my opinion, instead of trying to find street parking and circling the same block dozens of times. IF you do end up not wanting to shell out a few bucks for parking, I highly suggest dropping your passenger off at the restaurant to put your name down. The wait can be long, but you can order a bloody mary at the bar and sip on that while perusing the pastries so it's not too bad. Also, I thought it was so wonderful that the people who took my name remembered both my friend and me and came up to us nicely when our table was ready instead of yelling out my name. How do they remember all the faces and names?! Food here is all good. I don't think I need to recommend any one thing because you'll be happy with anything on the menu. DO NOT leave here without getting a beignet or two or three.

Holy hell!!! This place was amazing. We had 2 of the $20 entrees, skirt steak and short ribs and they were expertly prepared. I smelled the pizza from the table next to us and that was all I could think about while eating. The smell of salty doughy goodness. Must go back for the pizza! Didn't get to desert, plates were very filling. Conveniently located across the street from 7th and grand bar.

When we arrived, it was already a bit late, but it was no less packed than what it would be at normal dinner hours.  This dimly lit (so dimly lit my photos are a bit eh) popular Italian hub has an extensive bar, a dessert section, and a gourmet market, topping off its bustling, yet romantic ambience.  We were told the wait would be about an hour, so I proceeded to their dessert corner to take a peek at their macarons (2) and impressive looking desserts.  I was most interested in the earl grey, which had a milk chocolate ganache filling, which really wasn't why I got it.  The earl grey macaron was my top pick cause it has gold flakes!  It was just too pretty to resist.  I also got the raspberry, which I really liked, and a couple of others.  The salted caramel wasn't bad, but I think I actually liked Lette's better... We were hungry and excited for dinner, we were all ready to order when we were seated.  We got a half and half split Bianco and Sausage Pizza (20), Trenne Pasta (16), and the Portobello Fries (10).  The Portobello Fries was an excellent choice for an appetizer, as the batter was crisp and delicious with the meaty mushrooms.  How can you not love friend mushrooms?! =)  The Trenne Pasta, a pan sauteed trenne pasta with braised rib eye, kale, and parmesan, was interesting - and not quite what I expected - but nevertheless tasty.  The sauteed trenne pasta was crispy and was my favorite part of the dish, but the kale was also a nice touch.  The portion was a bit small, but as expected at a $$$ restaurant. The half Bianco and half Sausage pizza was alright, but not something I'd get again.  The Bianco was good because the garlic flavor really popped and rocket arugula is one of my favorites, but it didn't taste particularly impressive, and neither did the Sausage pizza, which has fennel sausage.  Oh well, I wouldn't recommend the pizza here, but we had better things to move on to - dessert!  We decided on the Chocolate Souffle (15), which is the most expensive dessert they offer, but it was so, so rich and delicious.  The cake part was hot and fluffy, went really well with the vanilla, and together, the souffle was a perfect sweetness and flavor.  Needless to say, we were satisfied and all fooded out that day!

This place is no joke.  I loved it.  I took a date here before I flew out to miami.  I ordered the Lasagna.  I'm not really a pasta lover which is why I don't really go for italian.  But this place is really good and their staff is insane awesome.  The host stand team.  It's dope: they take your name... and go and physically find you where you are and take you to your seats.  How do they know where I am??   Either way, the girl sat us and the host asked me if I wanted a window seat. I declined but I thought it was nice of her to offer. The attention they pay to you...  and how you don't really have to make a big deal to get attention.  It really gave me a great dining experience.

Whatever to the 4 starts, this place is a 5 star venue. Why? Look around downtown! Its the only thing of any substance close by that's not a bro bar, snob bar or mediocre businessman lunch place (the kind of place that can stay open forever being mediocre). Desserts? Superb. Pizza? Too good. Pasta? Why would you get pasta when you eat out? (but its good, too). Avoid the traps of downtown and eat here!

Came here today for lunch with a friend who had told me that I needed to check out this place before I move away from LA... Loved the portabello fries, mushroom pizza, and lemon ricotta pancakes we got (random selection of food, I know, but all raved about by previous reviewers). Atmosphere was classy, yet casual and we were seated relatively quickly before the lunchtime rush. Got a salted caramel, earl grey, violet, rose, and matcha macaroons to go, can't wait to have those for dessert :)! Parking was easy, found a nearby garage for $3 flat rate on Saturdays... Will definitely be back, quality/taste of food well worth the price!

BL encompasses the service of a high-end restaurant with the atmosphere of a world-class, well designed space all wrapped up in the vibe of a small italian restaurant. They do what they do very well and we'll be back! My boyfriend and I stopped by this popular downtown eatery as a last minute alternative when our first choice was closed (President's Day weekend). I am so glad we did. Sometimes, when everyone seems to rave about the same place, I counter intuitively avoid it, preferring to find my own "sleepers" and wondering how spoiled the atmosphere is going to get if everyone is going. I was enticed and blown away at every turn by BL. From the moment you walk in, you feel transported. The bakery/pasterie at the front entrance is so beautiful and like a little food gallery. We were seated promptly without a reservation and had a great table for 2 against the wall that was perfect for people watching. Everyone at BL is on their A game and the pretty servers are most likely actors and actresses by dream, this is their day job. By like all career dream-chasers, they've perfected their day job. Our server, Samantha, was so warm, efficient, and just really really good at her job. We received our food quickly but were never pressured to get up. The food: amazing! We had the meatball sliders and lemon ricotta pancakes--- delicious!!! BL encompasses the service of a high-end restaurant with the atmosphere of a world-class, well designed space all wrapped up in the vibe of a small italian restaurant.

Damn. I don't think I've ever been this disappointed. So we come here one evening for desserts. Not for dinner, just desserts. We grab a table at the bar/patisserie area, and a server quickly set us up with water, utensils, and a number. After that, we don't know what happened. He walked past us a few times, never bothered to ask us for our order. Never even really looked our way at all. We sat around for about 20 minutes before we were able to flag down someone to place our order. In this time, a table of 4 sat down next to us, ordered, and started getting their food already. We had the chocolate souffle, creme brulee, tiramisu, and macarons. The creme brulee was okay, nothing spectacular. The caramelized sugar on top was burned in some spots, so that kind of ruined it. The tiramisu was surprisingly dry. I feel that the Tiramisu at Porto's is better, by far. The chocolate souffle was the only item we had that was decent. Now the macarons. I don't know what happened, but they sucked. I understand that macarons have to be left out at room temperature for a day so they soften and become not chewy. The earl grey ones we had were definitely just taken out of the fridge or something. The center was cold. The shell was chewy. Definitely inexcusable for a $2 macaron. I also had the matcha macaron, and that one was a bit better. The flavor of it wasn't very matcha-like. Instead, the filling tasted a lot more like white chocolate. I think Lette's has much better macarons, or at least the quality is consistent. For a restaurant with close to 5,000 reviews, I was utterly disappointed. I will come back for the dinner, but I probably won't be ordering dessert when I come back.

This place is really cute and is Instagram heaven. When my mom said she wanted to go all the way to L.A. for dinner we were all complaining, but on the way home, we were thanking her. We parked a in crappy little parking lot next to it and made our way to the restaurant. After passing a few bums and dodging some trip-worthy cracks in the sidewalk, all of the sudden, low and behold, there is a marble step with gold railing leading to a bright, colorful, and delightful place. Wait, this is where we're eating?! It was like walking into heaven! The thing I like about this place is it's fancy, but not fancy. It's definitely pretty and is a nicer location, but not so much so that it makes you uncomfortable. You can show up wearing normal clothes and not feel underdressed. It's got the dessert/treat portion where you can just sit down and have a quick bite to eat making the place have a more casual feel, or the sit-down restaurant portion. Also, having dinner here doesn't break the bank. Those portobello fries were very memorable. And I don't even like mushrooms. My dad ordered a steak and won the prize for the best dinner. Of course their desserts are legendary. I really liked this place and I think it's especially good for a group outing.

This review is on the desserts only. I was not impressed with the Macaroons, nor the price I paid, and the large dessert options are just ok . . . I've had better elsewhere. I had high hopes for BL as the ambiance is upscale and a great draw for trendy downtowners and tourists but the quality of the desserts were not equal to that. It seems to be more of a focus on seeing and being seen than quality. I will go back to try their food and post another review.

Over-hyped Overpriced Over-hyped Over-hyped Overhyped Came here for a lunch business meeting awhile back for the first time.  At first my coworkers were jealous- after all this place is supposed to be a gem right? Walking up to the white canvas scattered with half walls and a mix of silver and white carved stone it has its castle feeling to it.  The space is completely open and massive.  Were movies filmed here?  Probably a few.  But despite the physical scene the experience was not all too cinematic.  Yes it was very "Los Angeles" but nothing more than just a fluffy cloud of over-hyped crap. We walked in to hear a roar of a very crowded lunch hour.  There wasn't much of a wait. It was primarily other business folks from around the financial district.  Lots of suits suits suits.  (This should have bumped things up for me but it sadly didn't) Seating was packed.  I felt like we should be making friends with the tables seated on both sides.   At the time this was a getaway from the office... a talk of promise and a reminder that I deserved to relax a bit... a reminder that despite the things that I had going on personally to know that I was appreciated professionally as well.   I wish it had been quiet enough to really enjoy it. The chatter was so loud that it was difficult to even have a cross table discussion. Sparkling water carafes joined us next.  I looked around again.   This was what I had worked so hard for. To be appreciated enough not only to be acknowledged but to be treated to something my coworkers envied (on several occasions). To be able to take care of the bill without a problem if I needed to with all the money I had been able to save from busting my rear end with two jobs. For moments like this one sitting across the table from a colleague in a suit in a fancy posh place for lunch. But something was still missing.   Maybe it was me.   Maybe it was the complete stark white around me as not one piece of art grabbed me.  Louie was what it was... and it was proud of it. We ordered our food.  My boss wanted something that the waiter insisted couldn't be done.  He didn't believe them. "Let me talk to your manager." he said with a smirk. And sure enough it was done.  It was things like that that reaffirmed why I conduct business the way I do.  How hearing a no is never good enough until... never. The food wasn't that great.  I'm not seeing what people raved about.  It was overpriced and bland.  There was nothing unique about it.  It just was and it was proud of it. We got some cappuccino.  I took in the rest of the experience.  So much chatter.  So much buzz. So much.. fluff and fancy garbage. And then there were the macaroons.  They were the only piece of color in the whole establishment.  Gorgeous rainbows of culinary confection and dainty little boxes.  We got some to go. I looked up once more.  I looked all around me.  Suits suits suits. I sighed once again.  You had so much potential.  Why oh why did you fail me?

MACARON HEAVEN! You really can't go wrong with ordering the macarons here.  They are $2 each and worth it!  My favorite flavors were the salted caramel, earl gray tea and the espresso.  I didn't really care for the rose one not because it tasted bad but because I couldn't taste the rose at all.  I bought 5 total and they came in a cute little box for no extra charge.

This place is insane. Downtown LA was relatively empty on the Sunday we went, but honestly I think the whole city just migrated into Bottega Louie. We didn't even get a chance to try the food. We were utterly confused by the line snaking around the tables to the front door. There was a 10 minute-long wait JUST TO PUT OUR NAMES DOWN. After wandering DTLA for another place to eat, we came back for the macarons. Yet again, another episode of confusion: to order, we had to shout through the the glass window and/or point, and then later push through another long snaking line for payment and/or ordering (we didn't know what came first, and nobody would help us). Overall, very disorienting. There was just too many people in here. I don't think I could stand another visit. Anyway, the 4 stars are given for the macarons. Yes, they're excellent and well-crafted, and yes, they were nicely packaged. But, keep in mind that this place sells individual macarons for $2 when others are a little more humble with their $1.50-$1.75 macarons. Anyway I can't stand the place. Just way too crowded. Felt like a city in a city.

FOR MACARONS ONLY Am I the only one who doesn't like their macarons? Sure it's colorful and wrapped up so nicely in a box. But really.. the texture is horrible. I came here on a random Thursday night a few hours before closing and the line here was ridiculous. It was packed and chaotic. I don't even know if there really was a line or if I cut someone. (kind of like Porto's check out strategy). I saw that their ROSE MACARON was starting to run out, so I quickly tried to get someone to grab a few before they were gone. BAM! they were gone. My boyfriend went to the further end of the bakery section and saw that there were piles and piles of rose! He ran back to the girl helping us and kept asking "do you have anymore rose left?" She responded no. So he asked 2 other people and they each said they would go check. 5 MINUTES LATER... well, well, well. They decide to bring out the rose. I was actually disappointed in their rose. All that struggle for nothing. I don't think it was very flavorful at all. And about half of my box of macarons were so hard and chewy. Some of their flavor combinations I would NEVER understand. There are far better places to get macarons, like Lettes or Chocolate Opulence in Santa Monica.

BEST PLACE DOWNTOWN!! I absolutely love this place. The menu, bar, service, bakery/cafe, atmosphere..all of it! Whenever I am downtown, I literally go here for breakfast lunch and dinner for the most part. It is a cool concept with good food. Try the portabello fries, burrata pizza, ham and cheese croissant, brussel sprouts, and tagatelle bolognese. The only disappointing dish I ever had was the lasagna. This place rocks!!

Love love love this place. Wait or no wait. Been there five times in 10 months, and loved it everytime. Twice for lunch, twice for dinner, and once for after hours coffee and dessert. Decor is luxurious yet simple. High ceilings and the white exentuate the feel of grandeur and posh. It does get noisey and crowded, yet somehow, no one infringes on your space. The place is divine... even the bathrooms, they are immaculate! The Pizzas, Salads, Soups, Burgers, and of course the portebello mushroom truffle fries are just delish! You ask, "how about the desserts?"... Oh, please do not drool on my macaroons!!!! Yeah, you should have some, and take more home! I always do! I think Bottega Louie brought hip & taste to downtown LA! So, Thank you! Merci, and yes, I will go again!

I didn't expect such a HUGE dinning hall.. Loved the pastry section, macarons are heaven sent! The Matcha macaron I had was incredibly savory; sufficiently sweet, but green-tea-bitter. The morning vibe is the best.. Sun showering in, bright and luxurious hall, simple dinning furniture, open kitchen.. Just try hitting up the place for a lovely breakfast/brunch! Slight downfall, my silverware was definitely NOT well-washed.. But pleasantly taken care of by a polite waiter, so I won't bash too much about it.

So, the entire reason I came here was because I bought this little frozen box of Trader Joes macarons.  The vanilla ones were sooo yummy that I thought, "I must buy the REAL THING!"  Off we go to Bottega Louie, to try the "authentic" macaron.  $2 each.  Tiny macaron.  Bought the Earl Grey, Pistachio, Vanilla, and Dark Chocolate (red) varieties.  They pretty much all tasted the same, except the vanilla, which was better than the rest.  I cannot tell you how DISAPPOINTED I felt about everything I ate from here.  I cannot believe the ABSOLUTE FALSE HYPE about this place.  Granted, this review is only for the bakery/service, but still. This place is truly OVERPRICED and OVERHYPED.  I cannot believe how many people flock here for the $2 macarons.  I would pay maybe 25% of that for it.  MAYBE.  They just weren't that great!  The hazelnut bengeit was just like a donut with Nutella inside.  Not really anything special.  The cherry and pistachio eclairs were okay (I liked the cherry better), but again, not really something to write home about.  I think the cherry eclair had to be the thing I liked most out of everything, but I really would not go back just for that.  The rest of the bakery items are generally SO EXPENSIVE!!!  $30 for a teeny cake?  Why?!  I'm sure it's not even that awesome, I'm guessing, due to the experience I had with the rest of the baked goods. Anywho, the service was.. mehh.. just as bland as the food.  Granted, I only interacted with 2 women at the bakery table where the macarons are, but there was not 1 smile on either of their faces.  They were honestly very bland... not UNfriendly, but definitely leaving something to be desired. The place itself is pretty, but that's about it.  If I was in the area, I might return to try the restaurant, but the bakery is likely not something I'd ever specifically return for.  Too bad.

Ok... Looks like I've seen this hype before--I've seen this hype in LA whenever LA comes up with something less than LA, something ..."New York"? "Chicago"? For the lack of a better reason,  it has worked. And this hype, I can't stand, coz I always laugh at how sometimes LA wants so much not to be LA. However** disclaimer: Bottega does their boogie well. So, I give them credit. Their service is good, their bakery products good, coffee was good. And I do not mind not having to fly out of LA for non LA stuff sometime , so there.. It is loud, the sort of urban food hall loud that I do not have a problem with. I do think they should challenge themselves and rotate their bakery menus more often. They have the space, mindset and probably talent so sitting stale and producing the same things might not be the best for this type of food institution (they give out a culinary experimental vibe (least for the bakery) which I really think should not be surface driven but rather really production driven. Haven't tried their other stuff, no probs coming back

I really like this place for their food and desserts.  I have been here a couple of times to dine and a few times to pick up dessert.  Each time I come I have a great experience.  Their food is always great although I can't say the same about their drinks as I've gotten lukewarm instead of hot water for my tea before.  The set-up is kinda iffy since they have two eating areas: their main dining area and the bar/cafe area.  You need to be seated in the main dining area but their hostess desk is located in the middle of the restaurant in between the cafe/bar area and the main dining area.  Its easy to miss if its your first time coming to this place.The service though is always good. Now, the bakery area is a whole different level.  They have so many yummy baked goodies that you can buy and take home.  Although their French macaron is probably their best seller, I do not think it is the best since I like 'Lette's better.  Their earl grey though is amazing.  Rather than their macaron, I do like their beignets more. I love the original, not the ones with stuffing. I always walk away with a few of these in a box to take home. The major drawback to this place is their location which is located in downtown and kinda hard to get to.  Parking is awful and quite expensive. Despite this, I will definitely be back in a heartbeat.

Delicious eggs Benedict.. The true breakfast of champions (sorry wheaties). The vibe here is very relaxed and defiantly a feel of high end bakery. The only downside is that the prices reflect the look of the bakery. For 2 people to go eat a meal your looking at an easy $50. They also offer a few high end coffees that I would highly recommend. Much better stuff then you would taste at your local Starbucks.

Came here with a couple girl friends. The place is crazy loud and chalk full of patrons, but we were ushered to our seats ahead of everyone else waiting.  Got to love it when that happens.  One of us must have looked important : ) Food was good.  Macaroons were a delight.   Will absolutely be back.

After forever of wanting to try out Bottega and listened to all the "hype", I finally went! I opted out of getting pizza and joined bf in getting pasta. He got the trenne and I got the clam linguine. Trenne was unlike anything I've had before. It's cool and weird at the same time how they pan fry the pasta. It's very crunchy...maybe a little too crunchy? The sauce was rich and the chunks of prime rib eye were good...reminiscent of Chinese braised beef. Clam linguine was indeed a bit bland (like one Yelper said) and I don't see myself getting that ever again. Portobello fries are meant to share. It's heavy duty stuff. Earthy (as mushrooms usually are) and nutty from the parm. The aioli is perf cos it cuts through the fattiness of the mushroom. Good without but really good with! Saved for midnight snack and still delish! And onto my favourite part of the BL experience! Macarons! Earl grey by far the favourite... The colour is gorgeous and the gold accent just makes me scream a little inside (I love gold flecks/film on my desserts). Strawberry comes a close second. Matcha was subtle but flavourful. The green tea-ness came mostly from the ganache. If you're looking for a green tea punch in the face, don't get this one. Bought the lemon and passion but le bf's dad ate them. Salted caramel was good but nothing special. Espresso was on point. Strong flavour but not overwhelming. Le bf wanted a beignet with chocolate hazelnut aka nutella and that was alright but nothing special. Extra star just for the macarons and aesthetically pleasing desserts. Next on the list to try: short ribs and pizza!

I think if I lived closer to this place the colorful macaroons would tempt me more.  However, as it is a destination eatery for me, I am basing this review on the food I ordered from the menu.  I ordered the seafood cooked in a light tomato wine sauce and got the fried portabella.  It was ok.  It was cooked properly, nice sauce, the mushroom fries were good.  It was nothing to write home about, or go out of my way to get.  The macaroons are also audaciously priced.

Been passing by for a long time now & I finally went inside to try somethin'. I was a little uncomfortable cause as others have mentioned; it's crazy crowded, LOUD & overpriced. Anyway. Tried the Macaroons. They weren't that great. A little hard. I think I'd find better pastries in Little Tokyo. For a way cheaper price.

Portabello fries - disappointing. Was expecting something really awesome for the hype. 1 stars. Macaroons - 5 stars. I tried 10 flavors which was almost all of them, amazing! Favorite flavors are Vanilla bean (top favorite! creamy heavenly aroma) Earl Grey, Rose & Violet. Also the pistachio & salted caramel are very good. Incredibly fresh! They package them in either a cute purple or pink box with a ribbon, if requested no extra charge. Violet Cupcake - 4.5 stars incredibly light, fluffy delicate cake that is buttery & golden. Filling of cassis jelly had the perfect sweetness & richness with melt in mouth silky smooth buttercream frosting, not too sweet topped with crystallized violet petals. Nougat - 2 stars. Disappointing. Pizza - 4 stars, fresh quality ingredients made right on the premise in their oven, little oily but flavorsome. Soufflé - 5 stars ! Perfect flavor, not too rich or bitter. Thin, crisp shell frosted  in caramelized sugar then fluffy, light as air yet incredibly moist wet gooey centre. Lovely vanilla bean creme to pour into the centre. Best Soufflé I have tried in LA to date. I hear the panna cotta is great too.

Prior to my most recent visit yesterday, I hadn't been back to Bottega Louie in 4 years. For a while there I wasn't living in LA, and now that I am I never make it to downtown. Of-course it's only a short metro ride away, and after being reminded of how wonderful this place is... well I'm afraid of what its done to me. The food was absolutely delicious. I ordered a Caesar salad and some bruschetta, and it was divine. That being said, when we ordered our coffee and macaroons, well, the meal became heavenly. The food was delicious, I think you get the point. Your welcome for the cheesy references. I am here all week! Then there's the whole ambiance. The very French Rococo interior makes you feel like you've left LA. Everything is presented to the nines, and everyone who worked there was incredibly friendly. I foresee many more metro rides to downtown.

Talk about a factory!!!! I didn't eat here, just swung by real fast to pick up macaroons as gifts. The macaroons are amazing and run $2 a pop. While the food looks amazing, I would have a hard time eating here. This place is super LOUD. You have a big open space and everything is echoing and bouncing off the walls. While I do appreciate a little noise when I eat, this was too much. Maybe I'm just getting old! Otherwise, great use of space, great service and great macaroons.

I've been here roughly a dozen times over the past year, and I have to say this restaurant is consistently excellent...among my favorites in LA. Last Friday, my partner and I went to enjoy a pizza and salad, and when we got there it was typically bustling. We spotted two seats at the bar, and decided to sidle up for dinner there instead of waiting for a table. Boy are we BOTH glad we did! Frank and Brittany make fantastic drinks - we each had an Old Fashioned made with our choice of rye whisky, which Frank graciously let us taste test to make sure we would like. Jason Hotchkiss, the Executive Chef, consistently creates delectable goodies. We've always been wowed by his menu (the Arugula salad and Bianco pizza are our new favorites. Don't pass up the macaroons. They're fabulous!   Then there's Edwin. Edwin transformed our pizza experience by very sweetly giving us each a small bottle of Tabasco sauce in place of the pepper flakes. He is also attentive and funny when he comes by to check on bread, water levels, etc. He's a real treasure. Every time we come here, we're floored by the high level of genuine caring service. Not only will we be back (regularly), but we're telling our friends to come here. You should too!

Not sure if I was drooling from the delicious food or the scrumptious eye candy..lol!!! Okay, maybe it was both  ;) I wish there was a closer location in the OC but alas, I'll have to make the trek up to LA to satisfy my sweet tooth for macarons and (eye) candy  :) OH! They have sooOOo many other desserts to choose from as well! It is just too hard to not order a box of my macarons that I never get a chance to sample their other desserts... Boo!

I work in DTLA Bunker Hill and BL is pretty close to my office. I heart macaroon so I visit Bottega Louie at least once a month. The silk ribbon tying to pink/purple box gives it a decent look as a gift.   *Must try flavor: Rose, Strawberry, passion fruit lavender, lemon...raspberry macaroon cake(loooove it). fruit gummies are delicious ,too. *cons: very loud  and noisy dining environment, hardly hear each other and you kinda need to shout... *food is good

On one of our last nights in LA last month, my husband and I decided to treat ourselves to one of the highest reviewed restaurants in the downtown area. I had previous book marked them for dessert after noticing their wide selection of Macaroon flavors. When we decided to dine in close to 10pm (thank goodness they were open until 1am I believe) but had to put our name on a list and wait to be noticed of a table. Now, I like thier system of getting your number down and sending you a text, instead of giving you those annoying buzzards that don't work if you wander too far away. About 30min later we were seated at a table. Our server was pretty attentive and gave wonderful suggestions. We opted to try the two soups (tomato bisque and french onion) as well as the portobella fries and a pasta dish. I ordered a mojito iced tea as well. Once the waiter came back, he had accidentally brought out two of those drinks but ended up letting my husband have the extra one free of charge which was nice. BTW, do get the mojito ice tea if you're like me and don't enjoy alcholic drinks much. It tasted just like a mojito, minus the alcholic after taste. Now on to the food.. The soups arrived shortly after our drinks along with some complementary Epi's (crusty french bread pieces you can pull apart) along with some butter. Both soups were delicious, however, we both agreed that the french onion was PERFECT and we were fighting over who go to finish it. Our portabella fries (the ones that everyone was raving over) arrived next and we both gave them a try, even though my husband hates mushrooms he said it didn't taste too "mushroomy" and he enjoyed the dipping sauce. I thought they were OK but the portion was so big that we kind of got tired of eating them. They were good but not mind blowing as others had described. Perhaps, cutting them a bit thinner and adding more seasoning would have helped. Finally, our pasta dish arrived, it was basically a plain garlicky white sauce with roasted garlic and broccolini on penne. This dish however simple it may seem was absolutely delcious even though it was mild in flavor. I wish I could remember what it was called but it was something our waiter "Bill" had recommended. Overall, our service here was top notch as was the food. Albeit, a bit pricey, the quality and the flavor as well as portions did not disappoint. Oh and the Macaroons were fantastic, my only regret was not getting a bigger box to take home. I've already book marked this place to stop by the next time we're back in LA!

Took Dad for a bite after a Kings game at staples...it was his first time....at first it must have been overly crowded and very loud for him.....but as we ate and conversed and  people watched.......it all came together for him and he  loved it! The food was delicious..we ordered small plates.....got some free mojitos, shared a pizza and enjoyed some sorbet.....not many places offer free sparkling water as well as flat...and the service and table side manner of the staff was v good for such a busy establishment.......we have always enjoyed our food and dining experiences here...glad nothing's changed....no wonder its always so popular......thank you Louis Bottega!

A friend recommended we check out this place, so we went around 7:30 pm on a weekday and it still turned out to be a 45 minute wait!!! This place must be good. While waiting for a table to open for us, we took the time to walk around and look at their bakery. I ended up buying some macaroons for myself, my mom, and a couple of relatives to try, as well as, the CHOCOLATE COVERED GINGER. For the MACARONS, I got the LAVENDER, GREEN TEA, MANDARIN ORANGE CHOCOLATE, AND CAPPUCINO/EXPRESSO (forgot which it was called). I myself, only tried the CAPPUCINO-flavored MACARON and it tasted exactly like it's name. Whether I'll pay $2 for it again, most likely not. The other flavors were distributed to my mom, aunt, and cousin, so I'm not sure what they tasted like. The older Asian generation though really seemed to like the CHOCOLATE COVERED GINGER (what's up with Asian parents and ginger? I don't know). Afterward we checked out the bakery, we headed to look at the dishes being made. Yes, you are allowed to watch them in action. And before you know it, we were seated. Yay! We were served bread with butter as an appetizer. My friend and I decided to share the PORTOBELLO FRIES and I decided to order the pasta TRENNE (Pan sautéed trenne pasta with braised prime rib eye, tuscan black kale & shaved grana parmesan)  worth $16.00. First off, everyone, especially mushroom fans, have to, have to order the PORTOBELLO FRIES. I wasn't expecting much at first but when I took my first bite, I was like "Holy Mushroom!!! This is amazing!" The fries are crisp and delightly seasoned on the outside. The aioli sauce to dip them in makes them even more amazing. Highly recommended!!! As for my TRENNE pasta. I'm not much of a pasta fan because, to me, sometimes they all taste the same, but out hostess highly recommended this dish. The presentation was beautiful but the taste was like 100x more beautiful; the flavors truly made my mouth sing. Maybe it's because I don't order pasta entrees often, but this dish was in a category of it's own. The pasta was shaped like a triangular prism and was fried crispy on one side, which gave it that edge in texture compared to other pastas. The braised prime rib eye was tender to perfection. The Tuscan black kale soaks up all the sauce making it juicy. The ingredients went well together - you had your carbs (pasta), protein (braised prime rib eye), vegetables (Tuscan black kale), dairy (shaved grana Parmesan), and fruit (the sauce?). I would definitely come back here whenever I'm in the area. I would love to bring my friends to check this place out. I might even order the same things.

Freshly made apple juice with sparkling soda. Expensive juice. Small glass is five bucks, but it was decent. Ordered the smoked salmon benedict. Was pretty good. My pops ordered the smoked salmon which came out with a bagel. At first he was doubtful of the dish, but loved it so much I was speechless since he never likes American food. If the place has got his approval, it has got mine. Mom ordered the smoked salmon millefeuille. Comes out on flaky layers. She liked it. Anyway, you can't go wrong with the smoked salmon.

Disclaimer: I just came to the pastry counter to buy some macarons. Had I not already eaten, I would have loved to sit down and nosh, because peoples' food looked awesome. Since that's out of the way... THE PASTRY COUNTER IS A CLUSTER! People everywhere! No line! Madness! Sheer madness! The pastries looked beautiful (though very pricey, even for a place like this). However, my macarons didn't taste as beautiful as they looked. I got the strawberry and the raspberry chocolate, and I was underwhelmed. The flavor was meh, and they were a little stale. 'Lette has Bottega beat in this area. Also, it was damn loud. Not sure if it would be worth it to sit down, even for brunch :/

Love Bottega!  Was first introduced to it when my mom got me a box of pastries from bottega louie #years ago. The place stuck to me that we ordered cupcakes from them as our wedding favors. 120+ cupcakes in individual boxes. They were amazing. I communicated with someone via email and she was able to accomodate my special requests. The restaurant portion is great as well. Some of the food can seem pricy, but still good and worth the price. The burrata pizza is YUM. We had also had the juiciest porkchop ever. Drinks are free refill. I liked the green tea almond palmer. Bottega is known for their macarons and the rest of their beautiful pastries. Espresso is my fave macaron.  We live farther now, so i dont mind splurging a little more on treats whenever we're in LA :)

I had the duck confit crostini and the fettuccini. My friend had the seafood dish with tiger prawns and the grilled artichoke. We also got the raspberry saint honore for dessert. My pasta was tasteless and her prawns were too salty. We had to ask the waiter to put down some cutlery. Other than that, he was really attentive and nice. The duck crostini is a MUST HAVE, and it was my first time trying artichoke and it was REALLY GOOD. The pastry was hard and it was tough to cut through it even though it tasted really good.

Yesterday was my first time coming here because my friends and I decided to have an adventure day in LA. This is the first place we decided to go to and man...I HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH A BEAUTIFUL RESTAURANT/BAKERY LIKE THIS. All the different desserts caught my attention and I definitely wanted everything. Bad news, I didn't get everything. LOL I actually got 5 macaroons; pistachio, matcha, passionfruit, earl grey, and strawberry. All of these macaroons tasted delicious, although i didn't really like the earl grey. After I purchased my macaroons, I really needed to use the restroom. HAHA random, but OMG the restroom was so beautiful!!!!! This has to be the nicest and cleanest public restroom I've been in. HAHAHAHA I give this place 4 stars. It would've been 5 but the place was a little pricey for me :( maybe i'm just a broke college student.... LOL

Went in with a large group for lunch & Ouch! What a nightmare that was. We got in early enough to beat the major lunch crowd, & could of easily been seated in an area that was closed off but Nooooo, the day supervisor didn't want to open it up for us knowing in a matter of moments he'd have to open it anyway's.  Instead we were seated in a table that could accommodate eight, yet we were eleven. The tried to cram all of us, which was not pretty.  After complaining, we were moved to another spot, & seated an "L" shape manner.  At that point, we didn't care. Appetizers were slow & upon picking up my fork, I discover a not so clean fork.  Normally I would of just left, but after the long wait & the fact there were ten more people, I stayed. I ordered the steak, & after a nice wait, it arrived.  I was in heaven.  It was cooked (medium) to my pleasure & each bite melted in my mouth, as did the veggies that came with it. Now, back to the seating...after the waiting, then being seated & then moving to be seated in another spot that left my group somewhat stretched out from each other, at the moment we were being seated the second time, the day supervisor opened up that closed off area we asked to be seated at...what an ass! Lunch took us about an hour & twenty minutes, lucky for us, we weren't pressed for time that day. Three stars for the poor service.  Maybe a smaller group, probably no bigger than five would be better.

Purchased Maccarons today... $10 for 5 and I wish I could say they tasted like dirt but they were simply beautiful and well worth the dinero. Harrods FoodHall type of layout without the glamour..and the staff were indifferent and forgot to put my purchase in a bag...handing me the paper bag instead but additional training will fix this..ghetto staff in puffy hats still remain ghetto..it would of been fine had I purchased tacos...anyway...and I did not get a receipt...did not know I had to ask for one... The Salty Caramel maccaron and the Lemon were pieces of pleasure and delight that we will partake in again...soon. And I shall keep my lipglosses in the cute box....I see a collection coming on...I hope the boxes get fancier the more one purchases.

In a phrase: expensive and underwhelming. We'd come for an early dinner, so got seated very quickly. Bread was just okay, so I drowned it in balsamic vinegar and olive oil. The much-raved portobello fries were meh-inducing, so I drowned it in the aioli that came with it. Sausage pizza was meh, clam linguini was meh, meh meh meh. Service was friendly and thus relatively better than meh. There was also another waiter that looked startlingly similar to Sheldon from Big Bang Theory. We laughed. But then, meh. The only remarkable thing from Bottega was the earl grey macaron I ate two days later; the delicacy of the tea was a welcome break from how overpowering the other macarons were. The vanilla is rich and fragrant [a good thing, but the other 3 [matcha, strawberry, salted caramel] were much too sweet for my taste.

As a vegetarian, I thought I'd have a hard time with French food. Sure enough, almost nothing on the Bottega Louie menu was veggie-friendly. However, after a short discussion about my situation with the waiter, he came back from the kitchen with a delicious pasta dish, covered in vegetables and melted in butter. It was delicious, with gourmet ingredients, and the perfect mix of healthy with flavor. The drinks were great too - they use an herbal liquor rather than normal alcohol, of which I was wary at first, but was definitely an adventurous order that paid off! I gave 4 instead of 5 stars because of price and (lack of) parking situation. But worth a splurge for sure.

I LOVE Bottega Louie. Can't wait for NYC friends to come to town  so I can take them. It is big, busy, high energy and great food and drinks. I like that they don't take reservations. You'll love the first come first serve area near the bar (those tables are small).  You can get  bakery treats and other goodies at  an area in the very front --sort of set up like a deli/bakery. The place is huge  with a modern mostly white interior and very high ceilings... The kitchen is open until midnight. It is really fun. I can't wait to go back and have the Modena salad again!

I really enjoyed my experience here. Came here on a recent trip to LA and our hosts raved about it so we had to give it a try. It's such a beautiful restaurant, I wish I could live there! The atmosphere alone caused me to anticipate having the greatest meal of my life, but it was just okay. I had linguini with clams which was good, but I was expecting a bit more flavor. Honestly I don't think I ordered the right thing because everyone else's plate at my table looked spectacular. I finished off with their creme brulee, which was an A+ dessert. Also, you can't go to Bottega Louie without getting some macaroons, so I bought some to go. They were good, but not the best I've had (I'm particular to LaDuree in NYC). All in all, I would go back on my next LA trip, I would just have to order something different.

The wait wasn't too bad on a Saturday afternoon.  Parking is $5 in the next door lot.  This place is well thought out - a bar, bakery and semi-open kitchen.  I loved the high tray ceilings, simple gold hardware, marble countertops and of course the pastel colors of the signature boxes and packaging lining the bakery.   Samantha was our waitress and she was awesome and patient.  She was efficient and receptive. The salmon puff pastry (millefeuille pronounced mooly fooly) was excellent and not too large a portion, which was perfect.  It was delicate and delicious.  The eggs benedict and the lobster hash were pretty good.  The raspberry beignet was really yummy and I liked the matcha macaron out of salted caramel and passion fruit.  They had other flavors - earl grey, raspberry chocolate, expresso, vanilla, dark grenache, pistachio, etc.  I think the beignet was better than the macarons. Definitely will be back!

So what do you do after you do an engagement photoshoot? EAT. EAT and EAT. And so I was excited when it was suggested to come to this much talked about place. Wow! This place kind of resembles an upscale Porto's Bakery .. FOOD QUALITY: The food here is really good. Ingredients here are of high quality and they pretty much have spot on execution. It's been a long time since I've had such a luxurious meal. Appetizers: Upon trying Tomato Bruschetta, Portebello Fries, Carpaccio, and Calamari, my favorites were the the Fries and Carpaccio. Definitely recommend those two. Entree: Margherita Pizza - Coworker's genius idea to swap out mozzarella for burrata cheese .. and I have to say this is probably one of the best pizzas I've ever had simply had. Short Ribs - I've been to a lot of Chinese restaurants with this kind of meat -- and I'm not going to lie such that the flavors of the short rib are very similar, if not identical.The only difference is that they do it right here where the meat is ridiculously TENDER. Paired with the ragu, polenta, and ricotta ... a definite heavy, but tasty dish. Oreccheitte pasta and Sausage pizza were generally okay with me, but both have really good sausage. Caesar Salad - I scratch my head at this.. for $14. Dessert: Fruit Tart - Creamy, sweet, delicious with balanced texture of the fruit flavors and sugar. Macarons- Soft, chewy, sweet, uhhh these are actually really good. SERVICE: Service was nice, polite, and attentive even though it was incredibly crowded. One quirky (good) thing was that the hostess remembers the faces of people who are on the waiting list and actually hunts you down to tell you your table is ready. I thought that was very impressive.. ENVIRONMENT: Loud! Loud! Loud! Even though it was comfortable it's pretty hard to hear your own conversation with other people. There's an ample amount of space here, no doubt. Just that it's super crowded. Overall, I'm pretty impressed by this place. I think I would definitely come back here if I felt like splurging a lot of money. On a side note, I find it amusing how this place attracts various types of customers; from spoiled teeny-boppers to college students/graduates to families and to businessmen.

This is my favorite spot! I frequent this are because this is my neighborhood and love the people, atmosphere, food, and quality! I have went on a few dates here recently and we had amazing service, and the food was incredible! I had the fried pasta dish that was so unusual. The service is amazing, 5-star. I love the fresh full Italian bakery they have which is a perfect spot right next to the bar. Try the rose macaroons, they are my favorite! The dessert selection in completely gourmet for fine palette and they have an in-house pastry chef to make every dessert fresh. The architecture reminds me of Italy, an upscale spot on the upper east side of Manhattan. When you walk in, the restaurant is a wide open space and there is a beautiful elaborate open fireplace to the back of the house. I love the open line of the kitchen where you can see all of the cuisine coming out to be take to the tables. The furniture is very basic, but simple is elegant! The white marbleized looking floor is a definite accent to the Italian theme. The cream-colored white bricks with huge open bay windows panoramic style to see outside. I think the quality of restaurants downtown have come a long way! Definitely try this place its one of a kind! Its kind of loud and loaded with the party-hipster well-off type on the weekends, so bring your ear plugs!

This restaurant is more then amazing.  When you walk in they have gorgeous High ceilings and a macaroon bar that you can't help but gaze at.  There are so many different types of macaroons from Strawberry to Lavender.  They also have a huge array of different desserts.  The atmosphere is great here. Very sophisticated and a bit artsy at the same time.  You will definitely find many different types of people here.  Soooo about the food...theres not much to say but amazing, and everything is literally amazing.... Grilled Artichoke Hearts- melted in your mouth like butter.  The sauce was great and made the dish. Couldn't have asked for a better appetizer!! Lamb Chop- Ok so mind you I really don't eat lamb but I figured I would try it since a friend ordered it.  I am officially now a lamb lover.  This piece of meat was literally so tender that I a hardly had to chew it. It had an amazing flavor that I was not expecting. Yumm...Def Try!!! Shrimp Scampi-Simply great. The prawns were cooked to perfection and are huge.  The mashed potatoes are light and creamy.....just mmmm!!! Burger- I did not try this but my friend raved over how good the burger was.  He said it was thee best burger he ever had! Beignets- ordered their beignets with the cranberry sauce....So light and fluffy ans sweet!!! They were great! Chocolate Souffle- Takes about 15-20 for them to make it but it is worth the wait.  Once they bring it to the table they take a spoon and break the light crust on top and pour in some type of vanilla cream.  The inside is nice and gooey while the outside has just enough crunch to offset each other.  It is not overly sweet , it's just right!!! OOO and it also tastes great with the cranberry sauce from the beignets!!! This place is a def must try!!! I will be going back soon!!

Love Bottega Louie! I've been here a few times and I've never been disappointed. I've tried their Napoli, Burrata, and Sausage pizzas. All three were good but my favorite would have to be the Burrata! And like a lot of people mentioned, their Portobello Fries are to die for! You definitely need to try it once! Their macarons are good but I think I've had better. I would probably pass on the macarons but if it's your first time there I am sure you wont be able to pass since they are colorfully displayed in the front. I have yet to try their other desserts. More the reason to go back! ^^

For weekend brunch, we sat at the bar and was served by the bartenders and avoided the wait. If we had waited the dreadful wait...this place would probably be a 3.5 stars. This place is overly hyped up I think. I'm pretty sure it's because of their colorful macaroons and other baked goods, which of couse you have to try. The bartenders were very nice and it was nice seeing all the concoctions they were making. Portobello Fries: These fries are just what everyone says. Delish! I think it's the batter they are covered in and the aioli they serve with them. The fried batter was nice and crunchy. A little thick side but perfect enough to make the portobello slices stand up. Burrata Pizza: I personally love burrata and this pizza was nicely put together with some rapini (tastes like kale/chinese brocolli for those who don't know). The crust was good...thin, just the way I like it. However the bottom was slightly burnt...I think they needed to clean the pizza oven. This is big enough to share between two. Porchetta: This was good. That's all I could really say about it. Nothing stood out too much. It's a decent sandwich and I enjoyed it. Oh and you have to get the green juice! You'll keep wanting more and more. It's healthy for you since it has all the greens and fruits but taste so amazing! I want the recipe!

I usually ask my friends to meet up here to catch up on our monthly dinners. The place is huge, clean, and has great service. The only downer is that they don't take reservations so the wait can be long.  On the upside, there's a bar and bakery out front for you to occupy your time with while you wait to get seated.  While I wait, I usually grab a glass of wine and order a box of macaroons to go.  What surprises me most about the service is that the hostess always remembers your face and finds you when it's your time to be seated. The food is delicious. I always order the Portabella fries, Lasagna, and Chocolate Souffle.  When with big groups, I'll add on the Margherita Pizza, Calamari, and Spaghetti.

*3.5 stars* DECOR: Huge space with minimalist decor, Awesome open kitchen AMBIANCE: Loud and bustling -------------------------- FOOD: MUST-TRY: Portobello Fries = Crispy and delicious GOOD: Mushroom Pizza Scallops Mussels Chocolate Souffle MEH: Tagliatele Bolognese Pasta = Too little sauce, too little flavor Sausage Pizza Asparagus w/ Poached Egg = Overly burnt asparagus, Nothing special Brussels Sprouts with Pistachios -------------------------- SERVICE: Although our server, Samantha, was awesome, we did have an unfortunate incident with one of the busboys who spilled my friend's drink all over her shirt. He ran off to get napkins, but didn't return for minutes, while the table was still covered in water and her drink, and she was still drenched in alcohol. Other than a half-assed "sorry", we didn't get anything other than her drink replaced (which should have happened anyway since he spilled the original one). I would've expected a place as nice as this to have at least had the manager come over to formally apologize or have something comped. -------------------------- SUMMARY: All in all, Bottega Louie has an incredible, lively environment that's perfect for after-work drinks. The food is all pretty decent, but other than the addictive Portobello Fries, nothing really shines. The macarons are good, but a little too chewy. Other than the drink-spill incident semi-ruining our experience, Bottega Louie was definitely a good time.

Their food and dessert are really great. They have some interesting dishes like portabella fries. Their staff are friendly but super busy. If you come here anytime around dinner to 10pm, expect a 1.5 hour wait. No reservations allowed btw. So plan accordingly. They are also very efficient with their food, and very high-tech, relatively speaking. They will text you when your seats are available. The decor is also spectacular. It makes me feel like i'm in europe, hence their name. I highly recommend this place. Oh and their staff are soo cute!

The downtown Hilton recommended Bottega Louie to me and my boyfriend. We were visiting LA and wanted something different. We ate here 2 morning before we left LA. This place has incredible food. The french toast is so delicious and mouth watering. W also got some deserts to go before we headed home. Everything was so fresh and delicious. I loved the butter cookies. I will have to go here to eat and pick up deserts every time I go to LA.

What else left is there to write? The food is fantastic, the atmosphere is stark, yet chic and the service is pretty good. We started with the portobello fries which we good but had a very thick batter....I couldn't eat to many! I also liked that they allow 1/2 and 1/2 pizza, so I split a pizza that was 1/2 burrata and 1/2 sausage. The burrata was the winner here because of the huge scoops of creamy burrata placed over perfectly sauteed rapini. The only disappointing thing to me was the macarons! I was so surprised, but the flavors were just not developed or complex, especially in the salted caramel one. I would come back for the pizza, but probably skip dessert.

I have been to this establishment several times and have enjoyed each experience. However, I have never, for the life of me, been able to recall any entrée that I've ordered here. Majorly at fault is the case of scrumptious sweets and desserts I find oh so painful to tear myself from during each visit. I swoon for macaroons and many yays for those beignets. This review however shall focus on the much revered portobello fries and my recent experience with them. My friend and I stopped by one Friday a few weeks ago for a late dinner and ordered the fries for starters. We have since sworn off men and turn to portobello fries during moments of loneliness. The lemon tarragon aioli is a perfect pairing to the salty, slightly crunchy batter, and the softness and lushness of the portobello makes you dive in for more. I managed to heckle our waiter into giving me a clue on their fries but the most I could muster was that milk and a flour unlike regular flour is used for their batter. I'll give it an old college try in my kitchen but there is no beating or replicating these fries! Truly one of a kind!

I've heard lots of buzz about Botega Louie and was really excited to check it out.  The atmosphere is very posh but you can still have a casual, albeit loud, meal.  Surprisingly not the best place for a date because you could never hear the other person, but still enjoyable.  Service was very good and food was delicious.  Me likey! Green drink- I loveee green drinks.  This one was pretty good: kale, apple, lime, and melon...I think. Sausage pizza- cut very unevenly and only had sausage on it.  I wouldn't get it again. Of course there are lots of desserts, especially macarons to get after.  They're presented beautifully and taste delish!

I once tried a dessert an have always wanted to come here. So, glad I did. Got the calamari, Brussels sprouts, portobello fries, mushroom pizza, lasagna, and a chocolate souffle. Remember, order the souffle early because it takes at least 20 minutes to prepare. The food was good but for me the best part was the dessert. Service was wonderful. Our server was friendly yet completely professional. She was very attentive and made sure our glasses were filled. The venue is beautiful! It's basically a large white room with high ceilings and a marble floor.  It provides a nice canvass that contrasts with the wood furniture and leather seats. The only thing I didn't like was the acoustics. Voices seemed to bounce of the walls and the ceiling. It was tough to get a conversation going without talking loudly. Other than that, it was a good dinner. If you do come, try the desserts!

Very upscale for downtown yes gives a very urban New York feel! Yumm little treats and the best part about he food is that's fresh and made in an open kitchen. Some very cute chefs ;) The only down side was that it was over crowded and they don't take reservation and we had go wait almost 2 hours to be seated but once we were they treated us very special and apogized for the wait which i think is extremely important and takes away the pain instantly.. Also wouldn't recommend for large parties.

Feast your eyes on this! Every Angeleno and tourist should experience Bottega Louie. It's just so pretty inside-- even the bathroom is beautiful in all its sterile white and gold splendor. The dessert bar is mesmerizing when you first walk in. Next to it, there's a bar area with several small tables if you just want to grab a quick drink and bite to eat. If you choose to wait for a spot in the main dining room, then you can stand by the food prep areas and watch all the chefs work meticulously behind the glass walls. There is just so much to take in! It's straight out of the movies, or a magazine, or even a dream if it weren't so loud and crowded all the time. The waiters are all so handsome and charming, and everything I have ever ordered has been delicious. Portobello fries, mussels, spaghetti, sea salt caramel macarons, AND their pizza might just be the best pizza downtown. Bottega Louie is perfect for date night, your mama's birthday, or to impress your out-of-town friends :) If only all restaurants were this much fun!

This place is so loud. SO LOUD. My friends had to shout at each other so we could have a conversation. We only had a half an hour wait but the place was so busy. It was impossible to move around without someone almost bumping into you, and we even saw a waiter run right into another waiter and drop a bunch of food. Overall, it was very loud, unpleasant and hectic. The restaurant was okay. Mediocre. For the price I expected food with more taste and unique flavors but it was really just boring. I really liked the portobello fries and the sauce it came with, but that was it. The bakery was GOOD though. The macarons are yum and the packaging is adorable. I'd come back for drinks and dessert, but not for food.

Rude Management/Hostess They don't take reservations, and when I showed up with a large party (10) they said they only have two tables that accommodate that many people and they refused to join tables so we could eat together, and not nearby (this balding dude with a 5 o'clock shadow wearing a suit, who apparently is the manager during the day rudely told us they don't do that; his face looked like I had just passed gas around him when we asked). I keep hearing/reading how this restaurant is very "New York-like", so let me tell you how Los Angeles locals get down... We sat down at our two tables (about 4 feet apart), took off our coats/jackets and simply moved the tables together. Dude in the suit didn't like it one bit, and I saw him call our waitress over to find out what was happening, but in my best L.A. "WTF are u gonna do about it, holmes?" stare, he simply had to live with it. I personally didn't like this one bit, aren't restaurants supposed to accommodate their clientele as best as possible? This place obviously hasn't received that memo. Our waitress was very nice and the food was very good. The hostess (who I'm guessing is a runway model in training by the very non-friendly look in her face) brought most of us the wrong menus (our waitress politely apologized and brought the right ones). I suppose the hostess is just there to look hip. I think maybe the super tight mini dress was stopping the blood flow to her brain and maybe that's why she looked upset and brought over the wrong menus (luckily I had one of the right menus, so the food I was actually interested in was available, sucked for others in my party who had already made up their minds and had to reset their wishes when they got the right one). I get it though, the place is hip and they don't have to try to please people or be friendly/accommodating; this place is mostly frequented by young people (singles/dates) and I remember those years in my life; service wasn't really important as your mind is elsewhere, and it sounds like this establishment knows their target client. Maybe that's how they do it in the Big Apple, but this is L.A. and you can GTFOH with that attitude; there are MANY great restaurants in L.A. that offer great service. That sh*tty attitude can STAY in New York!

I actually have been dying to come here, but it wasn't what I imagined. The place is huge and even though you have to wait it goes pretty fast. When I saw the dessert section I almost died of how good it looked. After sitting down we got a pizza, mushroom fries, asparagus and poached egg and meatballs. The mushroom pizza was good and the portobello fries were amazing!! Best dish ever! I would highly suggest to try this! The asparagus was burnt and the egg was't poached - it was dry. I had it returned and they made a better one this time. Everything was just kind of mediocre. There weren't enough waiters at all so we constantly had to wait... Lastly I finally decided to try the dessert-macaroons and eclairs. How terrible! They were all dry and tasteless! The eclair was gross almost like it had no flavor and it was just sitting there for days. I'm not a sweets person, but when I have it I want it to be fresh! This was such misadvertisement. I would have given it 4 stars, but not after that dessert!!! BOO

The macaroons are to die for.  Binets - nothing much at all.  Taking home some pastries that look amazing!   Ordered the smoked salmon benedict which was good but would've preferred if it was on a traditional english muffin instead it came on a potato hash deep fried patty which was over fried, hard and burnt in some areas. Hence the 3 * Next time I'm going to ask if they can substitute with a muffin.   BTW our server was attentive, courteous and really pleasant.   Will definitely be back.

Brunch with the ladies on Saturday morning. Beautiful day with your usual crappy L.A. traffic...normal. This place is downtown so expect parking structure parking. We parked on Grand and it was a short walk. Perfect. I really didn't do much research on this place other than figure out directions; however, pleasant surprise. I like the place. Modern, uber white decor, love the set-up of bar, bakery and dinning. It works. Now, I'm going to break this down in 3 parts since this place has bar, bakery, and dinning. I made sure to partake of all 3. I drove up separately from our brunch group so a friend and I were there first and had to wait. We chose le bar. I like it. Looks slightly intimidating with their fancy bartenders and machinery but staff was super friendly and easy. Mimosa and coke. Done! It has its own little dinning area too but it seats like a person or 2. A bite to eat and you're out type of deal. I enjoyed. It's overpriced of course...but it's L.A. It's acceptable. I give le bar 4. Easy in n out. Next, we move to main dinning area. Seated nice and quick style. Place is louddddd. I barely heard my peeps. Menu is interesting and appetizing. Great traditional and non-traditional menu choices. I ordered the italian scramble....god-awful. Yeah, I picked wrong but It looked bad-ass on the menu. Not so bad-ass in front of me. The rest of my party had the french toast, beignents, salmon/ egg. They loved it. I guess I was the exception. To sum it up, waiter was decent, food was ehh but what really got me, was the noise and price for the quality of food (not really worth that much). They should probably take this item off the menu because it just wasn't cut out to be on the same table as the rest of the food. 3 stars Bakery...I was impressed with the decor first and THEN i saw it. ALL of it. It was overwhelming and then it was soooo cool. So many delicacies...so many sweets...so much delish....how much?!!!! Yeah, slightly expensive;) However, this is the place they make almonds in chocolate or plain marshmellows look pretty classy;) I get the sense you come here to buy foodie presents for birthdays, baby showers, and bridal showers. It's the packaging my friends! They're known for their macaroons. Ehhh. Get something else but not the beignets. Not impressive. If you're gonna drop $, get something that looks like it's worth it! tarts, eclairs, the huge creampuff;) 4 stars....impressed but not sold;) In the end, I'll only come back to buy impressive, packaged goods for my fancy shmancy friends. Love, Coco

Is it even worth writing a review and be 5,064? What better night for me to finally try this place but Superbowl Sunday!! WHOA!, no traffic to downtown, 12 minutes from Culver City and no wait to get a table, me and my girlfriend had a wonderful table near the window and had excellent service. This place can and will get loud as many have reviewed, but when you have a screaming child scream at the tip of their tongue, well, that's just wrong. It echoed throughout this beautiful building. Back to the food, Margherita pizza was an excellent choice as an appetizer and I went for the Lasagna. Both were absolutely delicious. My Cosmo was perfect, where the bits of crumbled ice floating in the center with a touch of lemon. Just the way I like it! How silly that our dinner only lasted an hour, but with no wait I couldn't have been happier. BUT.... of course, leaving the valet, I asked them how do I get back on the freeway, they said go straight, so I did, but I still got lost going home. Augh!! I suck when it comes to directions. And DTLA is not the place I really wanted to get lost or ask for directions.

I just fancy the beautiful display of macaroons. I had a small plate, an eggplant dish. Vegetarian and just the right amount of serving. Another venue serving water from the bottle. The swatting area: self-seating is small and somewhat crowded, but the venue is such a big venue. There is typically a long wait, luckily for me, I came, I sat and conquered my meal. Yes, it's fancy and yes it's pricey. But the price is fitting for the food. The sweets on the other hand is a quite pricey. Just a tad but they're yummy. I got a dozen. I are ally wanna go back and check out the rest of their menu!

Came here solo on Valentines day because i got out of school early and didnt want to drive to the valley and get all that traffic. So, i yelped this joint and decided to give it a try. I loved it! i walked in and the bakery area was packed but the bar area was wide open so i just pulled up and grabbed a table, It took a few minutes but i was finally given a menu. I ordered an Old Fashioned from the bar and the lasagna with a side of mashed potatoes. The Old Fashioned was good, stiff. The lsagna was ok and ive had better mashed potatoes but overall it was pretty good. For dessert i ordered my favorite dessert, creme brûlée, it was on point. My waitress was super friendly and very attentive. You get a nice view of the citty streets and you get to see all the people that pass by, its pretty neat. I will be back.

It's just alright, lots of hype. Food isn't amazing but it's not bad either hence the 3 star rating. Portobello Mushroom fries are a must

With almost 5000 reviews here, what's to say that hasn't been said? The short ribs are stellar. The cocktails, delicious. The draft list leaves much to be desired (but I suppose that's not their target anyway), but the wine list is great. The portobello fries were, in my opinion, overrated -- If you like Asian/Japanese fried chicken wings, then you might like these, otherwise you'll be overwhelmed by how peppery they are, like we were. The server brought our glasses of wine with our meal, as requested (it seems like this request becomes more and more difficult to accommodate at restaurants for some reason!). I asked for an espresso con panna at the end of the meal, and the server had to ask me what that was... I figured it was an Italian restaurant/bakery and figured he would know a bit about espresso-- my mistake. I've had macarons here in the past, as many have, and they're stellar, but I still prefer paulette / 'lette for convenience and value (but the beautiful box/packaging here for a set of 6 macarons is worth the extra cost!). The dining room has high ceilings but is very open... sort of a Disney version of a Paris cafe. So it's very loud, and you'll have to get close to hear the person next to you. Overall, it's an awesome experience and your girlfriend will be really impressed, so it's worth a trip, but I know of other places that satisfy me just as well without all the hype or the wait!

I can be a picky fucker....this place is so fuckin' hip I wanted to diss....I can't, honestly, I can't. Every item I've ordered here is spot on. This is one of the few places that's worth the hype.

MACARONS: 3.75 stars FILLING: 3.5 stars- The filling was thick and dense- you can taste the flavor but some flavors weren't that distinct (i.e., pistachio tasted more like what is this?). The filling is not overly sweet which is a plus for those who like milder desserts. Depending on your preference you'll either like the consistency if you like it more chewy or dislike it because its not as creamy like buttercream.   SHELL/COOKIE: 3.5 stars- Not as fluffy as I'd like, but luckily not as hard as some other macarons. It didn't really stand out to me although it wasn't bad either. The macarons are super colorful (hello food coloring overdose!) and are a bit thicker than some other places (e.g., 'Lette). They will set you back $2 each, but what really stood out about this place is the GORGEOUS BOXES they come in!! If you buy 5, its $10 (no extra charge) and the boxes thick not just a flimsy piece of cardboard like other places. Def. keepable and makes it very presentable. In addition they add ribbon to it for no charge. They're like jewelery boxes.. so cute! The service however sucked. The workers appear to be overwhelmed with the constant flow of customers and the guy who helped me seemed more annoyed than happy... which is not such a good contrast to those colorful bits of heavy I call macarons. Parking also sucks, although there is a lot next to the place that will set you back $6 (aka the cost of 3 macarons). Overall, I felt it was overrated like Laduree and would prefer Chantal Guillion, Bouchon & 'Lette's macarons over theirs anyday, but I gotta give them props for the most gorgeous presentation ever!

I am so long overdue for this review.. When you walk in to Bottega, you are mesmerized by the front bakery section of the restaurant. Colorful, bright, vibrant with their macaroons, desserts and gift items, it's just breathtaking! (Remembering being dropped off so I can get a table first before the crowd comes in. Instead of doing that, I was oohing and ahh-ing at the bakery section and totally forgot to get a table for dinner.)  The restaurant's vibe and ambiance is simple yet beautiful and elegant. Beautiful ambiance, beautiful decor, and uh-mm, oh yes, beautiful waiters with their mesmerizing smiles that can make you forget about the food and your date for a few minutes or so. :-P The only uncomfortable part of it is that its high ceiling results in getting VERY noisy inside. The wait for a table can be long if you come during lunch/dinner rush hour.  So prepare to do a little bit of a shopping or sitting by the bar area and do some people watching. The service from these oh so handsome waiters are impeccable! They are consistently with their service. Every time I'm here I feel like I'm being treated like a queen. Now the food... Like the restaurant, the food and desserts are so beautiful to look at, although most dishes are tasty, some items can be overrated. -MUSSELS- this dish of their Mediterranean mussels is delicious! They give you plenty of it, a big bowl of plenty with the sauce so good we dip our bread in it! - PIZZA can be ordered  1/2 and  1/2 at your request. We had 1/2 Burrata &  1/2 pepperoni -BURRATA pizza- Burrata, parmesan, garlic, olive oil & prosciutto di Parma. The Prosciutto gave the pizza a big kick! -PEPPERONI- mozzarella, parmesan, tomato sauce, oregano & pepperoni. Good ole Pepperoni always can't go wrong with that! -TRENNE PASTA- Pan sauteed trenne pasta with braised prime rib eye, Tuscan black kale & shaved parmesan cheese. The braised rib eye meat is tender and juicy. The trenne pasta is pan sauteed with a little bit of char grilled taste. Consume when it's hot, once it gets cold, the pasta becomes a little hard to chew. - SHORT RIBS- Omg tender!! The sauce has a little bit of an Asian Chinese dish flavor to it.  Served with Ricotta. A delicious dish but it's heavy. -LAMB CHOP- 2 pieces of lamb chops that are just mouth watering flavors bursting out of it. Tender meat that falls off the bone. It was so good, I even wanted to chew the bone off. Lol! -CEVICHE- small tapas size of delicious shrimp ceviche marinated into the tangy juice. -PORTOBELLO FRIES- The "Hype" here but I thought it was Over hyped. The battered was very oily leaving my stomach not feeling well. The taste is a bit bland, but dip it in the Aioli sauce and it's definitely tastes better. -FRIED CALAMARI -Yummy and addicting. Can't stop picking at it! -ARGULU SALAD: Fresh and crispy greens! -CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE-  takes about 20 minutes to bake, so always order this during your meal order is put in. -MACAROONS- My favorites are the Salted Caramel, Earl Grey and the coffee! -TIRAMISU- love the taste. Bittersweet and bitter.  YUM! Goes great with a cup of cappuccino -HAZELNUT (DONUT): sugar coated donut with hazelnut chocolate inside. -FRUIT TART: glazed with sugar syrup and delicious. The tart is flaky and fresh. -HAZELNUT CHOCOLATE BAR:  No bueno. Not worth the $. Overall, the restaurant is over hyped and over priced but definitely worth it.  Am I contradicting myself? Haha.  If you're a foodie, you should at least try out this place once. At over 4000 reviews, I'm sure this place doesn't need any more introductions. Make sure you got a few hours to spend here from the wait of your table to the end of dessert! Parking can be a big hassle. Street metered parking is very hard to look for because it's always full. Your best bet is to valet park or in the parking structure behind the restaurant for $5. Love their late night hours. Every night is opened until 11pm and Friday and Saturday until midnight!

my favorite part of bottega is definitely the macarons.. they're so delicious I sometimes make the hour long journey just to get some. In fact, it wasn't until the 4th visit or so that I actually decided to take the time to actually sit down and try the food. I tried the ceppo gambo pasta and I really liked it! Big juicy pieces of shrimp with a really light olive oil broth... I really liked the pasta noodles because they were chewy and fun to eat, and the dish was really flavorful without being overly oily or buttery. The server was really friendly and I overall had a very positive experience. Will be back if I'm in the area!

#1 Son:  "Hey, Ma.  Choose someplace nice, but casual.  I want you guys to meet (the girlfriend)'s mom." I've been wanting to go to Bottega Louie for the longest time. He works close by and has brought me macarons & his leftovers in the past. I wanted the full experience! (Plus, I wanted some pretty food.  The husband is not a fan of anything that he thinks looks cute.) Perfect choice for a first meeting! The atmosphere was fun, we could chat comfortably and was great for people watching. Even though it's casual dress for lunch, people were still in full trendy gear. Good thing I gussied up and glued on the fake eyelashes!   Us gals decided to order several dishes and share.  That way we could have ourselves a tasting menu. We ordered: Smoked salmon & bagel-  S'okay. Salmon Millefiuelle http://www.yelp.com/user…  This was excellent and oh so fancy! Proscuitto & Burrata- I didn't try this, but it seemed to go over well with the others. 2 orders of Portobello Fries- All around favorite with all of us.   Mache Salad-  Very good.  I ate most of it! A round of 8 macarons- server's choice http://www.yelp.com/user…  We chopped up those pretty treats so that everyone could try the different flavors. I'd like to thank our lovely server (Linda?  Lauren?).  She gave us some excellent recommendations. The place was packed, but she took very good care of us. For their desserts, #1 Son & his girlfriend ordered Creme brulee & Peanut butter terrine http://www.yelp.com/user… and raspberry Italian sodas http://www.yelp.com/biz_… The hubby went with Chocolate gelato. Funniest moment of the meal. Before leaving the house, my hubby was looking at pictures of the food.  He had his heart set on a pasta dish.   We find out from our server that those delicious-looking dishes were only served for the dinner menu. But he saw on the brunch menu that there was a ravioli dish.  Both he and #1 ordered it for themselves.  The look on their faces when the ravioli was brought out was priceless.  Instead of a plate full of raviolis, there was literally one large ravioli on the plate.  http://www.yelp.com/user… They both sat there with their jaws dropped.  Lucky for them, we ordered enough food to share ours.  They would have starved otherwise. Note- This ravioli was $10.  Each. The girlfriend's mother, her friend and I had the pleasure of being able to watch the pizza guys in action during our meal since we were seated next to the pizza station.  Very entertaining to watch the process from beginning to the drool-worthy end. We should have ordered a pizza.  They looked so good.   After our meal, we all went to press our noses on the glass cases in the bakery. What torture!  I could feel my glucose level rising just from looking at all those pretty creations. http://www.yelp.com/user… http://www.yelp.com/user… Overall, this was a lovely visit. Pretty food, good company and a fun atmosphere. We'd love to come back, but it's too pricey for us. Maybe if #1 treats us all again?

This place was great! The service was good. Complimentary flat or sparkling water. The salads beautiful! The pasta was great. Only small complaint I had was bread was harder than a rick. The Macaroons are  beautiful and AWESOME. This place is a must.   Not to uppity, not to casual. Great place to take a date.

Macaroons Schmacoroons! I'll take a brownie any day over those UFO-shaped pastel "cookies."  But I'll admit the bakery is pretty impressive if you prefer aesthetically pleasing desserts to a hot chocolate mess.   Besides that, this place is too loud for me to adore.  And it's not like the food is transcendent, though the blackberry mojito tickles me just right, and Sunday brunch satisfies a serious craving (Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict, Belgian Waffles, Portobello fries). I do love the edifice and location, but the poor acoustics make it difficult to relax.  I think I'm getting old.

I've been dying to come to this place for a long time! Mostly I've been eyeing all their brunch items online but my friend was having her birthday dinner here so thats what I ended up trying. Started with the ceviche and calamari both were decent. Nothing mind blowing but they were good. Stuff I probably wouldn't get again... LOBSTER NAGE - my least favorite item of the night. FETTUCINE BELMONDO - it was good but that might just have been because of the butter sauce. I mean what can really be bad in butter sauce? PROSCIUTTO & SEASONAL FRUIT - good, not sure I'd get it again but if you haven't tried it it's a nice side dish. GRILLED OCTOPUS - wasn't bad but  I don't think I'd get this again either. Def need to get again items BURRATA & ROASTED VINE TOMATOES - probably my favorite side of the night. PORTOBELLO FRIES - there were fantastic!! ONION GRATINÉE was mind blowing! Loved it.   DIVER SCALLOPS - probably the biggest scallops I've ever seen! And they were cooked perfect. CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE! - our table went through two of these. Order in advance cause they take like 50-70 minutes. I'm going to have to go back here soon for brunch!!

Great drink selections. Great energy. Food was mediocre. The octopus and portabello fries were not good at all. The scallops were acceptable. Meatballs, brussel sprouts, and kale sprouts were just okay. But the pricing was quite a bit more. In fairness, I'm comparing BL to similar places in Durham and Chapel Hill. The food quality and preparation are better in RTP versus LA. Ah well.

Have wanted to try Bottega Louie since I moved to Los Angeles and finally went this Monday night. To save you a google search, Bottega means "studio of a master" Energy and people feel an otherwise white and vacuous space opened up with 30ft ceiling. Towers of macaroons greet you in the treats window/cafe as you enter of Grand. We enjoyed short ribs with polenta on the waiters suggestion and an eggplant pizza. Good for groups. Not ideal for quiet, intimate romantic Italian dinners.

It's pretty. I think the price for what you eat is for your atmosphere. Our servers were nice, people were nice, everything was nice. Food was okay. I've been here on several occasions, sometimes with just one on one and other times with a group of friends, and the getting together for food part is always nice, especially with the nice feels around, it's definitely not my favorite place for "going somewhere nice to eat." The food is nothing amazing at all. Every time I had something here, I always think I just ordered the wrong thing. I've had and tried other people's pizzas, salad, Portobello fries, pasta, macarons, coffee, and other things maybe. I couldn't have ordered the wrong thing every time I've been here...Portobello fries are good though, but on the price-to-taste scale, I'd give it a ... meh. Macarons here are fancy. Pizza is okay. Sorry, I can't describe my foods, so maybe my palette is unconditioned to fancily priced food.   You also have to scream to talk to whoever you're with. The $6 valet "closes" at 11pm, but the parking garage across the street is $4 and doesn't close (but you can't stay overnight) - so plan accordingly if you're hanging out for late dinner with a larger group (because you planned on meeting at 8, and won't get seated until much later).

Expect to wait. And expect there to be hoards of people. But be pleasantly surprised when it's not a long wait. After standing in line just to put our names on the waiting-list (!) in a giant red leather bound book with gold lining along the paper's edge, we were seated within 10 minutes. Get the "Green Juice." Crisp and refreshing, you won't realize you're actually gulping down honey dew, green apple, celery, arugula, and cilantro. Wow, never did I ever expect those ingredients to come together so tastefully. Then, don't be a cheapstake like me, and order the specials--like Lobster Hash. If you go for the "Eggs any Style," which is good but nothing to write home about, you probably won't get the comprehensive Louie experience. It's a huge cafeteria-like setting with sky-high ceilings and a vast amount of open space. Great visually, although very sparsely decorated and white, but makes for an incredibly loud eating experience. Be sure to grab some macroons before you leave!

This place has a unique interior with loads of character. The brunch is superb. I had the quiche and was only disappointed that my slice was larger. The portabella mushroom fries were tasty but not crave worthy. Great place would love to come here again. The area it is in has lots of hobos but that's the story in downtown LA.

Bottega Louie had long been on my to-go list, and I'm so glad that I took the opportunity to go there with my best friends on a night in downtown LA! The restaurant is huge, with a stylish, marble interior that was dimmed (possibly for a more romantic setting?) and made seating more intimate. The place was packed, but my friends and I were seated immediately and we thankfully avoided the long lines that seemed to form right after we sat down. It's all candlelight, so I can see why a lot of people brought their dates here. However, because there were so many people, the noise level was a bit loud, so you might have to speak up if you want to actually be heard. I also noticed that the waiters and waitresses here are extremely attractive! The bread and butter they serve is good -- wish the bread could have been served a bit warmer though. I tried the lavender soda, which was delicious, and hope to order the elderflower lemonade next! The waitress was very prompt with refills and service. My friends and I all ordered the portobello fries and pasta. The portobello fries were absolutely delicious! Very rich, so splitting up the portion was perfect for each of us since we still wanted room for the main dish and dessert! I ordered the pomodoro, which is pretty much a red sauce pasta. Absolutely delicious. I tried a bit of my friend's Ceppo Gamber, and the pasta was thick and chewy. Very flavorful. Of course, Bottega Louie is famous for their macarons (you can see macaron trees proudly displayed on the counter tops!). I bought the 5 for $10 box, and the presentation was so beautiful! I bought a mandarin-orange one, strawberry, salted caramel, earl grey, and matcha. Judging from the reactions of my mom and aunt, the strawberry and matcha macarons were very good. My favorite was the earl grey; the mandarin-orange was savory and the salted caramel, sticky and decadent. Can't wait to come back here again!

I've been here once for dinner with my boyfriend, and he had really hyped it up beforehand because Bottega Louie was one of his favorite restaurants. When we arrived very late on Saturday night after a concert, I was both surprised at how busy the establishment was and impressed by the atmosphere. The space was bright and white, and I felt as if I were in a movie. We were seated after a short wait, and to my left, I swear I saw a Jonas brother on a date. The other patrons at tables seemed to be somebodies too, or maybe Bottega Louie just has great lighting and everyone inside looks more beautiful than normal. The food was good, but I wasn't blown away. I liked the bread that they brought to the table, but I wasn't as fond of my pasta dish. The pasta itself tasted fresh but the sauce was too sweet. I wish I had room for dessert and got one of their colorful macaroons, but I'll save that for another time. Overall, I would definitely check out this restaurant again if I were downtown.

Loud place so don't think you can have a soft quiet conversational this place. Always packed with a ton of people. The food was decent but nothing over the top. The portobello fries were nothing to write home to mama about...the steak is $25 and is about 4-5 oz. Typical LA and parking was brutal!

None of the dishes I've tried here are outstanding except for maybe the portobello fries, but I love the experience of coming here. High ceilings, all-over white, cute bakery, smells like wood-fired pizza, lively atmosphere, good drinks, great service, and pristine bathrooms with an attendant. Drink of choice - Moulin Rouge (raspberry + vodka) Appetizer/Small plate - Portobello fries Pizza - Napoli (olives, mushrooms and red onions) Salad - Mache (chicken, avocado, snap peas, celery) Dessert - Salted caramel macarons. I don't like the chocolate souffle here; it was too floury and the inside was too watery. Every other time I've been here, the line is absolutely insane, but I actually came here for dinner at 7:20 on a Friday night and DID NOT have to wait. I was literally speechless when the hostess immediately took us to a nice table in the back. So, it is possible to not have to wait here if you catch it at the right time. I recommend calling ahead before you leave to find out how long the wait is.

**Macaron Review ONLY** "Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels." -Kate Moss Um.. no. Sorry, Miss Moss, but I'm going to have to call BULLSH*T! The poor gal clearly has never had good food. (Tsk.. tsk.) Moreover, she clearly has never had an Earl Grey macaron from Bottega Louie. Describing these dainty, annoyingly perfect cookies as a gift from God would be an understatement. No, I'm not possessed. No, my Yelp account was not hacked. And no, Bottega did not pay me a dime to write this review. I'm just a simple girl who's in love with a cookie.. an expensive cookie at that. What's there to love? + An outer cookie shell that's delicate, smooth yet still crisp + A moist and soft cookie underneath + A rich chocolate-y ganache that's infused with Earl Grey + That perfect 2:1 cookie to filling ratio Even if Bottega's macarons are far from the traditional Parisian macaron, they still rule in my book. And after 2 visits to both Bottega and 'Lette, I prefer Bottega. 'Lette fills their macarons with too much ganache that's too sweet and overpowering for my taste. At $10 for a cutesy box of 5, my wallet feels a little (ok, a lot) lighter, but my tummy loves me and there's no better feeling than that. ;)

Last night I headed downtown for date night.  I had been looking forward to Bottega Louie's french macaroons all day long!  Thankfully they did not disappoint.  However, most of the rest of the meal did.  I think breakfast and dessert are definitely better.  The waiter was very friendly and helpful and this review is completely focused on the food itself.  I would give the waiter 5 stars, the food 3 stars, the noise 1 star and the wait 5 stars (we arrived early enough that even though they said it would be a 20 minute wait we were sat within 10 minutes).   Now the food. . .we started with the Italian salad - wow quite tasty.  I ordered the chicken parmesan which actually was very good, however didn't come with any pasta.  So I had to order it on the side - thankful to our waiter who pointed it out.  Personally I think it's pretty lame that it doesn't come with a side of pasta.  My boyfriend got the linguine clams and said that it had no flavor and was dry.  Definitely needed more oil.  And the dish itself was quite small.  Good thing that I don't eat a lot because my boyfriend needed to finish off my chicken to feel full.

The place and ambiance is cool.  The macarons from the bakery are good and the price isn't too bad!  This is a good spot for a nice dinner  there's no need to dress upscale but at the same time you wouldn't want to show up looking like a bum.  The food pricing is not too expensive but at the same time not cheap.  I honestly don't feel the food is AMAZING but it ain't bad.  I'd say the food is above average.  the portabello fries are delicious the chocolate souffle was good and the pizza was my favorite part of the experience.  The way the dough is cooked is perfect.  Very light but not too light like a thin crust feel.  Good date night.  I would come back if i craved it.

I love Bottega Louie...for the most part. Ambiance is great. Modern, classy, and  TO-DIE FOR macaRONS...IT'S NOT Effin called MACAROONS like how some of you idiots pronounce it. Food: 4/5 portobella mushroom fries- hearty, juicy, with a slight crunch from the golden batter that lovingly coats the exterior. Served with a rich and creamy garlic aioli. Delicious! It makes me wish I was Mario...or yoshi so I could use my tongue instead of having to reach to grab them.  You must order these! Maiche salad- 5/5 Loved this salad! The dressing is like a light lemon vinagrette but when I went back a week ago it was gone...so maybe it's a summer/fall seasonal item. Blanca? blanco? whatever pizza- 3/5 Pretty good, I love arugala. but suggestion! ask them to make sure the crust isn't burnt. Our pizza had a little bit of burnt crust and it overpowered the taste, making it bitter. BOO. Onion Gratin- 5/5 standard french onion soup, with that ooey gooey broiled cheese on top. DELiCIOUS. Macarons- 5/5 2 dollars a pop but SO delectable. I know they are going to go straight to my ass and thighs but i don't even effin care. my favs: strawberry, matcha greentea, earl grey tea. perfect balance of crisp and chewy with a sweet middle. Not too sweet. just so good. So so so good. yum. so tasty. you get the idea. Waitstaff: 4/5 Manager: -500/5 The reason why I am not giving it more stars is because of the MANAGEMENT and Hostesses. I have eaten here about 6x in the past 6 months and each time, it appears that they've hired a new manager. Why are they always so pretentious?! Please find someone nice. It really starts the experience off on a BAD note.

Dined here twice, first time was probably closer to four stars, second time was closer to two, so I'll average them out. First time we came, got here on a thursday night at 6:45 PM. Was told that the wait would be around half an hour, so we put our names down, got some drinks and settled dow. First off, my husband ordered a glass of the "house red" at the bar, got a bill for $15 (a glass!). And this was just for your average cab. We checked in with the hostess twice (at 30 min and 45 min), and finally one hour and 15 minutes later we were seated (at which time we were starving). The food that time around was pretty tasty. We got the butter lettuce salad, the portabello mushroom fries (tons of umami), hubs got the boneless spare ribs (A++), and I got the linguine alla vongole. Overall I'd say the food was pretty delicious and our waiter seemed nice and attentive. Decided to come back, earlier this time! (5 pm on a friday) - no wait! We let the waiter instead of yelp make recommendations this time -- mistake! He recommended the mussels, which were essentially inedible. We choked down a few of them, and then I wanted to send them back but hubs (who hates confrontation) stopped me from doing so. This pretty much ruined the rest of the meal, which included the burrata (just okay), the portobello fries again, as well as one of their white pizzas. Pretty much that experience made us not want to come back again. We'll see. If you come, for sure follow yelp reviews instead. I can't see how a waiter recommended something that was probably the worst item on their menu. Oh but make sure you check out the desserts at the front. They're so pretty!

Saturday Night @ approximately 7pm... Came in for a table and was told 20 minutes so we put our names down but decided to sit in the bar area since a table opened up. The bar area is "seat yourselves" by the way. Within 5 minutes, we got a text letting us know our table was ready. So fast! But since we already sat down, we just stayed at the bar. Server was extremely friendly and accommodating. We ordered Portobello Fries and the Artichoke Pizza. SO GOOD!!! Definitely trust all us Yelpers on this one and get the Portobello Fries. I mean, unless you don't like mushrooms. Then you're missing out! Artichoke pizza was salty- which I enjoy. But just warning ya, it's salty. But the toppings, the cheese, the crust... perfection! Huge pizza too. Enough for 3. Cocktails were delicious & stiff enough for us to feel a lil buzz. Ahh, good meal.

Can I please come here everyday?! Wandered in here after a show at the Disney concert hall and fell in love. Fell in love with the atmosphere, the amazing food, perfectly sized menu, bakery, and oddly enough their Maître d' table! Food is excellently portioned, and so delish! Pizzas are big, recommend sharing them. The desserts.. Ugh heavenly!! And who can forget the rainbow of macaroons that catch your eye immediately when you walk in! Unless you use the other door then be prepared to drool over the case of take-out sandwiches, salads, and unique drinks! Do have to take one star off for the ridiculous wait times and no reservation option.

In a nutshell: The food and desserts taste pretty damn good. The presentation is fantastic. The ingredients are super fresh and high quality. The service is perfect and everyone is always so damn attractive (girls and guys). Now for the big "but": The portions are really small and the price is fairly high and in some cases way too overpriced for some items. So why come here at all? Well what always brings me back is the good food and the experience of fine dining within a casual atmosphere without paying fine-dining prices of an arm and a leg (just maybe a foot and a few fingers instead) and the macarons.   Weekend Brunch: Lobster Hash - Oh so delicious! I definitely recommend splurging a little more money and just going with this dish. You really get a whole lobster tail's worth of meat in here. And it tastes really good. Smoked Salmon Benedict - My second favorite brunch menu item. Ahi Tuna Nicoise - Third favorite brunch menu item. The salad arrives deconstructed so eat it as you please. Ravioli - It tastes good and I love the concept of having a poached egg within a ravioli and cutting into it and having all its delicious runny egg spilling out. However, it is a ravioli (SINGULAR) so I recommend ordering this for the novelty of the item and in no way to fill you up AT ALL. Pancetta & Burrata Scramble - Yeah, it's good...but uhh I can make this at home easy-peasy. So nothing special and I won't be shelling out $12 to order this again. Potato Pancakes - I really liked this one and for $5 I think was worth ordering to try. Bianco Pizza - Really large pizza, fresh ingredients, delicious. Beignets - Another delicious item. The beignets were light and fluffy. The raspberry compote was simultaneous sweet and tart but with the fluffy sugared beignets--heavenly. Caprese - YES. Delicious! Exactly what you'd want in a caprese salad. Lunch/Dinner Menu: Portobello Fries - Good and worth trying once, but not sure I would be that down to order them again. AKA tastes good but not mind-blowing. Pomodoro - I really really liked their pomodoro here. I know it sounds simple and pedestrian but their roasted garlic pomodoro sauce is sweet and remarkably delicious and the pasta perfectly al dente. Desserts: Macarons - Obviously don't leave Bottega without grabbing at least one or two of their well-known macarons.  Earl Grey macaron is hands down my number one favorite one here. I don't know how they do it but it has such a refreshing flavor without being floral or rich tasting.  Second favorite would be the Salted Caramel which will have a rich caramel/chocolate combo but it manages to taste smooth and the salted part isn't too overpowering. Eclairs - god damn... their eclairs.... so good. General consensus with my friends and I were the Salted Caramel one is their best but you can't go wrong with the other two flavors. *on a side note: I realize I pretty much said everything was delicious. And I don't take that back.. It's all damn good which is what keeps me coming back but what I meant to emphasize is that some items are better than others and worth the $ or spending the extra $, while others...while good, you can can definitely pass on.

FINALLY!!!!!!! FINALLY FINALLY !!!!!!!!!! I've been wanting to come to Bottega louie FOREVER! I went once to pick up some after dinner desserts but this time I overcame that clusterfuck of a box. The set up just to get to the hostess desk is fuckin RIDUNKULOUS. Seriously one of THEE worse set ups I've ever seen to get to a hostess desk. Please fix that bullshit. Their  system is we'll come find you once we tell your ass we would like to be seated LOL Psssh. People fighting for seats in the cafe area is funny to me. I won't even bother with that shit. Another clusterfuck area as well. Amazing how you actually have breathing room in the actual dining area -_-  So after almost 30 plus minutes of waiting, we get seated. Thank god because these sugar plum fairies were gettin on my damn nerves with their conversation while waiting. I was praying they were not going to be seated by us LOL. Onto the next! So scaling the menu and yet again I want to taste EVERYTHING!!!!!! Seriously not one thing didn't sound enticing. The waiter was nice but two of his friends one with a Sars mask on first -_- sat next to us and he was chooooppppppin it up with them as if we couldn't hear their whole convo. Don't get me wrong, he was a good waiter but damn I don't give a damn about what you and airborne baby has to chat about! Anywho we started with some bread. Didn't look like much but it was tasty sourdoughish bread and it was goooooood. I wanted more of that but I didn't wanna look like a pig :D  We started with the infamous portobello fries and this salmon sashimi ish dish. The portobello fries were deeeeeelish. I liked the aioli sauce with it BUT I wanted a different kind of sauce with them for some reason damn it. The salmon app was aight . The pieces were cut a lil thick a drizzle of some kind of oil. Some slices of raw zucchini and pieces of dill. This was aight. No mouthgasms, I was just hungry as hell, so that just wet my whistle. For entrees I did the short rib dish with a side dish of spinach and PIC did this pork sammie. My dish was deeeelish. The brown sauce mixed in with the oh so yummy white cheddar polenta. This dish mixed well with the side of spinach . The spinach wasn't sauteed down. It was cooked in between with rock salt sprinkled on it. The short rib was tender and had what I  assume, were cubes of pork. Great dish. PIC's  sandwich was CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! CRAAAAAACK!  It was like a chili verde sandwich on a bomb ass brioche!!!! I kept picking of PICs plate and  and you could tell he was getting a little mad. He got the cheaper dish and it was better than mine!!!!!!!  NOM NOM NOM NOM. I want that next time. If its on the menu when I come back haha. I was very satisfied with my meal. We took the biegnets home and  my sister and I fell in LOVE with them! They were beyond fresh and still good the next day. You really don't need the sauce. They shine on their own! Of course before leaving, you have to pick up some crack dessert and pastries. I just got a few macaroons and panacotta. At this moment im kicking myself in the fluffy ass for not getting two of those panacottas. So addicting. Seriously  panacotta would have to be my top 3 most favorite desserts to indulge in! Next time im gettin about 3 of those! Im not a macaroon gal but these were pretty damn tasty. I love how you can get a sammie or salad on your way out. Love the presentation of the wall before leaving. Overall I love this place for the food. The set up still sucks a big fat D, from the homeless bugging when you come and go, to that bullshit location of a hostess desk to the overpacked "cafe" bar area, I will comeback here an instant still, its that good!

The short version of it is, Bottega Louie is far far far more notable for their epic lineup of sweets than the food itself.  I'd been here three times before just to get macarons before I actually realized, "Hey, you should probably come here for food sometime."  So I finally did. Before I get to the food, I must note that the interior is spectacular.  Love the extremely high raised ceilings, the amount of sprawling space, and modern design.  There's always a bunch of people, an army of waiters, and the desserts are not just a matter of tasting awesome but LOOKING awesome.  If I were to rate the building itself, I'd give it 5 stars easily. But of course, it is all about the food.  In sum, it's good.  It's a great smorgasbord of options to try a bunch of different stuff.  I wouldn't say any of the food is world-class or even the best in L.A., but it's pretty good and will get the job done.  Solid, not spectacular I would say.  The rundown: 1. Mache salad:  The vegetables were very fresh.  Chicken was seasoned well and was soft, considering they used chicken breast.  Avocado was a serious plus. 2. Portabello fries: They are exactly what they are, sliced portabello mushrooms fried up after getting battered up.  Had to try them at least once because a lot of people have raved about then.  Personally, I would rather have portabello in a burger or pasta, not as its own dish.  Not bad, but not going to get it again. 3. Lamb porterhouse: Definitely a highlight of the food.  Seasoned well, although it still had some of that annoying lamb taste that I don't like.  Very soft and tasty though. 4. Duck prosciutto crostini: Um...weird.  Duck itself is already salty, so when it's put into prosciutto form...uh, yeah, not good.  Plus the balsamic vinegar that came with it threw me off.  Not a fan. 5. Asparagus and poached egg: Kinda hard to screw up asparagus.  It was really big, and the egg was good. 6. Trenne pasta: Very good, the prime rib, shaved parmesan, and crispy pasta were definitely a great combination.  Blended with kale, it gave for great texture and contrast. 7. Chocolate soufflé: Absolutely magical.  The souffle was very airy and had great texture to it.  The white chocolate sauce blended perfectly with the souffle.  Hell, I'm still dreaming about this thing. Appreciated the attentiveness of the waiters, gave good suggestions and constantly refilled our water. The wait is as bad as everyone says it is.  I appreciate that they don't take reservations because it gives everyone a fair shot at eating here.  But that in itself means that if you don't want to wait in line, you HAVE to come in between 5-6 PM.  I came at 5:30 PM and was amazed to not have to wait AND get a corner seat.  But 30 minutes later and the rush came...yeah, I don't want to wait THAT long for this place. And where would I be without talking about the macarons?  Macarons are definitely the highlight of this place.  Best gift ever!  Favorite is earl grey by far, but the strawberry, rose, and violet chassis get props from me too.  For $2 a macaron, it's reasonably priced.  Although they don't give a discount if you get 13, so it can get expensive. Will probably come back next time to try the pizza, looked pretty good on the other tables.

I always rave about this place to everyone. It's not the best Italian food ever, especially after Italy, but it's pretty damn good for LA. I held back on writing my review since I was waiting to have brunch there and I finally had a friend suggest we go there this weekend- SCORE! Every single time I come here, I ALWAYS order their Moscato d'Asti. This remains to be the best Moscato d'Asti I've had (not too sweet, not too bubbly, just perfect) that is regular and NOT a late harvest grape. My friend and I split both our dishes. He had the salmon benedict and I, the lobster benedict. I swear I felt like a third wheel during our meal. He loved the Hollandaise sauce on it and asked our waitress what was in it and apparently it wasn't in-house, which was surprising. By the way, I've always had stellar service here, but this waitress really takes the cake as one of the best servers I've had here and one of the few exceptional ones I've had EVER. Let's just say the salmon benedict was really good and all the ingredients were given much thought since they went perfectly together. I really liked my lobster benedict and the quality of the hash and our beautiful poached eggs on both our dishes, but I still like the salmon more. Since I could write volumes for this place, I'll sum it up before everyone falls asleep if they haven't already. Beignet- Why do they call it that? It's more like a bomboloni, is it not? The chocolate hazelnut is delicious for Nutella lovers. I'm still sad they don't fill them with custard. Portabello Mushroom Fries- I usually get this when I'm here. Love the aioli. It's not always consistent but most of the time, it's good. Pizza- It's been a while, but it's pretty good. You can also do half-half on toppings. Braised Short Rib- Excellent and fall-apart beautiful. Lasagna- I have liked their lasagna here, but it's not my absolute favorite. Tagliatelle Bolognese- Excellent and perfect texture and width of pasta. Trenne- I didn't like this as much... I like my pasta soft and not weirdly crunchy. Macarons here are excellent and my favorites are: Rose, Vanilla, Salted Caramel, Earl Grey. The only downside sometimes besides the horrible acoustics is the wait, but if you feel like you're waiting a bit long, you could ask how long it's going to be for you and see if you're lucky because sometimes they aren't able to find you (they take notes on what you wear) and they were actually ready for you. Overall, it's a great mix of trendy with a touch of casual classiness. I just love coming back and inhaling the atmosphere here.

A large group of us went here for my brother's birthday. The reason we went here was because of the free corkage fee and because the menu looked pretty good online. Turns out, that AFTER we opened all the wine, they decided to charge us $15 a bottle corkage fee. They also couldn't seat us all together and we had to wait an hour to be seated. I got the rabbit tagallete pasta (it was the special that day) and it was really good. I haven't gone back though because of the bad experience with the service and the ridiculous charges on the wines. Maybe I'll try it again once I'm less angry.

Bottega Louie is one of my favorite places to go to every time I am around downtown Los Angeles. This place has a top notch service, food, desserts, drinks, atmosphere, etc...best everything! I must admit it is kind of expensive, but it is worth every penny you can spend there. I've fell in love with the macaroons thanks to this place that has all kind of flavors. I would definitely recommend this place to anybody willing to taste good dishes, ambiance and service!

I have a fond place in my heart for Bottega Louie, they were the first place I had the chance to try macarons.  My mini-addiction was fueled and and I looked forward to my next experience. I even sent some to Mom and sis back home, they loved them too! So I can't speak for the actual restaurant, but the pastry counter is usually very efficient, albeit pricey , to purchase some very fine desserts. The macron display, front and center is a visual and taste bud sensation :) The blueberry tart was perfectly executed and my company and I simply swooned again over their little pillows of whipped merigne goodies. Parking nearby can be a challenge but we were bundling our evening with several stops so not to worry, 5 bucks til 11 got the job done at a nearby garage.

Their desserts are to die for... in downtown. Living in NYC in the past, there are far better macaroons/dessert selections there but being in downtown LA, this is as good as it gets. I love their selection of desserts, from macaroons to beignets to fruit tarts etc. My favorite has got to be their salted caramel macaroon, so delicious! Their vanilla comes in close second with me. Their hazelnut brownie is also one of my favorites here. Short wait to pick up to go because they are pretty fast here. If you get a box of 5 macaroons, you get their pink box, boxed up very nicely for you, for free. I love buying these as gifts to friends for a small, sweet bday treat.

it looks all fancy with glassed-walls and high ceiling. my friends and i seated at the bar first while waiting for a table. we grabbed some drinks, and their gigantic chunk of ice cube added a nice presentation to the drink. after 30 min, we got a table, and our server was nice and professional. we had tomato basil pizza, fettucini pasta, and ceasar salad. long story short, the foods were all good except their macarons. i think their macarons are famous only because there are not many macaron places in LA. but overall i liked this place. not too pricey, casual, modern, delicious. i want to go here for my next bday dinner.

The food here is very good and you won't have a bad meal.  It's not the best value though, because for the money , the portions are on the small side, so don't go here hungry.  The atmosphere and service are excellent! Here's how it shaped up: Table Bread: 5 of 5.  Probably the best bread you will have. Arugula Salad:  4 of 5 Organic Salmon Dinner with Potatoes and Veggies:  4 of 5:  Salmon looked to be approx 4 to 6 oz. Veggies were almost non-existent.  The potatoes were approx. 8 thin potato chip slice sized pieces.  Effectually it's a Salmon Dish with no sides. Pasta Pomodoro: 5 of 5 Complementary Carbonated Water:  4 of 5 Macarons:  5 of 5 So why the 3??  It's because total with tax and tip and no alcohol came to 65.00 and we went home to eat some more to get full so while the food is A-OK, we cannot be fans because it's not a good value for the money.   They either need to lower prices 20%, or increase portions in our opinion. That's really it.   (Reality  here is that many folks order the pizza, and fill up on that because it's a big bread meal so they are happy. )

1st time was amazing from food, service, ambiance. Will be back to bring my friends and family. They told me it would be a 40 min wait on a Fri eve, but that was bi-passed by the chef and mgr who seated us right away because of a slight issue w/ one of their hostess who needed to get "checked". My lady and me were treated like royalty and this kind of over the top service is seldom seen anymore so bravo! We had 7 items off the main menu and 4 types of desserts and then bought a bottle of their sweet white wine...1st item on the white wine menu. The food I thought was better than the desserts, but I don't have a sweet tooth. I read yelp reviews and agree...the place is loud...really loud LOL it's pretty funny. The energy is great though. 3 story high ceilings and nothing but white paint! Not a good place unless you know each other....3rd dates or less or business meetings will be challenging to engage & chat. Prices were reasonable..I've paid much more for inferior food. I did not have the pizza but will be back to have the near Brooklyn pie experience. First timers should go Sun-Wed when it's chill.

This place is quite a gem in the newly renovated downtown LA. Great place for a dinner for two or a group of 10. The food is delicious and the service is pretty decent.

Macaroons: Best ones for me were the salted caramel and Mandarin chocolate. Flavor was great, however, there was inconsistency in the consistency. Some were soft and flaky, others were chewy. Packaging for them was very pretty and cute - pastel purple and pink boxes (depending on how many you purchased) with delicate design. Would make a nice gift. In addition to the macaroons, I tried their hazelnut latte which was smooth and had great taste, but it wasn't anything special. The atmosphere is really lively and bustling. The decor is classy with high ceilings and ornate crown molding. They also have two open areas where you can see the chefs prepare dishes and desserts. Presentation is gorgeous; all the desserts in the refrigerated cases were works of art. :) I'd want to visit again to try their non-dessert food and eat my favorite flavors of macaroons again. Overall - a bit pricy, but definitely worth a try, especially if you love dessert!

I am enamored with this place! Yes it's a bit loud and intimidating, but so are most places worth trying. I've been wanting to go for years. Years! My mom has brought me home macarons for about that long, and they've been the best I've ever tried. The flavors! Rose, earl grey, passion fruit, Madagascar vanilla bean... violet! Delectable. Perfect amount of meringue, delicate sugar crunch on the first bite... sweet but not overly so. The pizza, too, is to die for. We tried the burrata, covered in fresh mozzarella and basil! And the caprese salad to start, cannot get enough of that mozzarella. We sat near the pizza oven, so we had a great view of the chefs doing their diligent work. The wait wasn't long... especially once we parked ourselves at the bar for mimosas and other champagne cocktails. Time flew by! I loved the marble bar, it broke up the monopoly of white that's the restaurant's style mainstay. On your way out, stop by the macarons... you will not be disappointed. Get one of everything!

Let me say this...  Grand Avenue just got a little more sophisticated between 7am to 11pm.  This particular night my friend suggested a late dinner and a couple of drinks.  We ended up at the bar section which is totally fine with me.  I've come to realize that as much as I enjoy the food - the people who come here are about 50 percent of the over all magnetism.  Sleek and opulent the building resembles Gothem - I feel like I should be wearing wingtips and sitting with good posture.  Okay enough with the Wow factor.  Here's the star of the show -  The one thing that I consistently must have after every meal is located at the bakery section - The humble Shortbread cookie.  Don't sleep on this...  It has this mellow sweetness and ends with a savory finish.  Some people like coffee and cigarettes - my vice is shortbread cookies.

The area the restaurant is set in is quite lovely (except for the parking area which isn't quite appealing or safe); you look up to see sky high buildings and city lights (well if you come at night of course). The restaurant has a classy, NYC, high-ceiling, chic feel to it. The bakery is absolutely gorgeous; grand displays of pastries and pastel boxes are a feast for the eyes. I tried 6 of the macaron flavors and all of them were absolutely delicious, worth the price. I had the strawberry, salted caramel, passion, rose, violet, espresso, and raspberry. All of them are worth trying, trust me on this. We sat down at a nice little candlelit table; our waiter was nice and funny and was always available if we needed anything. You'll find yourself having to yell to get your people to hear you, this is one of the loudest restaurants I've ever been to. It wasn't much of an issue for us though, but maybe you wouldn't want to bring a date here if you're looking for a romantic and intimate dining experience. We ordered the portobello mushroom fries (amazing, the sauce is great too) and the Napa pizza (pizza is alright, nothing special) and the calamari (average). The bread they give you is absolutely dreadful though, don't even try eating it even with the wonderful butter. It is rock hard and tasted burnt. Everything else seemed to be of high quality. I would definitely come back (mostly to try the rest of the macaron flavors!).

There's nothing not to like about this place-- historic building, great food & drink, and outstanding ambience. I was in a bit of a hurry, and was hoping there would be easy and convenient take-out options and there were-- and lots of them including healthy salads and juices! So, you can go in a group, on a date or solo. This time, I actually walked out with a varied box of macarons and a latte, which hit the spot. They use  intelligentsia coffee! It's a favorite! :) Just one warning: I parked on the street, and walked out 2 minutes after my meter ran out... about a minute too late! (This was part of the reason I was in a hurry!!) So, pay for lot parking or give yourself plenty of time on the meter as meters seem to be *strictly* enforced around there.

The food ? : WOW-WOW-WOW macaroons. The place is super busy. Dont expect to sit down in lunch time. Very nice and clean, great pastries, sandwiches and deserts. If you are in the area you have to try. Parking is not easy, so get ready.

Does this place need another review? I didn't think so but I'm gonna write one. We came for an early dinner around 5:30pm on a Friday night. There was no wait at all. After being immediately seated, we were greeted by our very informative waiter and he was wonderful all night long. Ordered a pizza half burrata and half pepperoni, the portobello fries, and ended with the mouth watering chocolate soufflé. Excellent light pizza, which is made in the pizza section. You can see them rolling/spinning the dough out. Made fresh. The pepperoni was a little greasy but it was good. I enjoyed it because the dough was really light.  The burrata was flavorful with burrata cheese, some sort of greens, and prosciutto. I'd recommend the burrata pizza over the pepperoni but its your own preference. Mushroom fries were awesome. Crunchy then the soft texture of mushroom dipped with their sauce. Not sure what kind of sauce it was but it paired well with the fries. There is plenty in one order. We couldn't even finish it. I really enjoyed the chocolate soufflé, it takes about 20 to 30 minutes to make but it is worth the wait. It comes out HOT. Once you take a bite of it oh my goodness...so soft, fluffy, excellent white sauce, not so sweet. All together it is a very decadent dessert. I think when I took the first bite, my eyes rolled back a little. It is THAT good. Granted I don't have anything to compare to but this was a wonderful first time. I would definitely come back to try other stuff. We wanted to order a pasta as well but we didn't even finish the pizza and fries. Good thing we held off. You can share everything so don't worry about portion. -Give it a try! P.s.: I thought this place was romantic, with the dim lighting, high ceilings, and white EVERYWHERE. Yes it is loud but I think it makes it more intimate. Just come in closer to your someone with the candle flickering in between.

Rude! Now that I have your attention... Today. Party of Six (3 sets of married couples).  All professionals, all good people, non are arrogant or rude, all are outgoing and friendly. All left the restaurant independently believing they were mistreated and looked upon as low life's by the Manager (mutual impressions discovered later in conversation). THE SCENARIO: 45 minute wait. No worries. It was Sunday brunch. Awesome server. No issues there. Food. With a few exceptions, great. Two in the party ordered steak and eggs. Steaks arrived cooked perfectly. One medium.  The other, medium rare. Both parties took a bite. Off the charts salty. Neither had salted his steaks before tasting. Other guests in party had long finished their meals. Server was swamped.  Manager flagged down. Manager took away salty steaks. A very long time later two replacement steaks arrived. One was cooked well done (medium rare had been ordered) and the heavy salt was back on both plates. Manager never returned to see how we were doing. Here's the issue... He stood from afar and appeared to glare at our table while speaking with another Manager and the hostess. It is exceedingly rude for a restaurant committee to talk about patrons in front of them and away from the table. We felt small. It was obvious, unprofessional, and rude. Nobody deserves that and those at our table are professionals who conduct themselves properly at all times and without arrogance. It's a shame the same cannot be said for BL's management today.

Since this place has almost 5000 reviews, I'm going to keep it short. Came around 2pm on a Sunday afternoon. Put our names on the waiting list- 20 min for a party of 2. Walked over to the front and purchased macarons and then found out our table was already ready. SCORE. Waiter recommended the eggs benedict and lobster hash. I ordered the eggs benedict- poached eggs, canadian bacon, spinach, and hollandaise sauce on an english muffin. WOW. JUST wow. Major party in my mouth with all the textures going on. Creaminess, saltiness, crunchy. Delectable. Heavenly. I would have died happy at that moment. I'm a massive lobster lover and I didn't even care to take a second bite of BF's lobster hash because I was so fixated on my dish. lol. Macarons were good but I still prefer Chantal Guillon in SF for my macarons fix.

Solid four stars. Although I've had bad times here, problems with service, and so on, I find myself falling more and more in love with Bottega Louie. Maybe I'm blinded by the high ceilings, beautiful crown moldings, simple decor, and NYC ambience, but the food really isn't bad -- if you know what to order. I've tried many items from their menu, and I personally love the Short Ribs, Pomodoro pasta, and Burrata pizza. Their most popular appetizer is their Portobello Fries, but I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms. Another popular dish, the Trenne pasta, is nothing more than pasta in a beef broth/stew, so I'd recommend you pass on that. The Short Ribs are so tender and each bite will melt in your mouth. And the Pomodoro! Tomato-based pasta with garlic, one of the best red-sauce pastas I've ever had (even better than Scarpetta). Service here is spotty and your experience ranges from terrible to amazing depending on server and hostess. Nonetheless, I'd recommend this spot to anyone who wants a trendy and affordable LA dinner. Bottega Louie is seriously a perfect spot for a night out with girlfriends, a date with your significant other, or to hang out and relax (in a nice suit) with your co-workers.

Smoked salmon Benedict-YES! Prosciutto & Burrata-YES! lemon ricotta pancakes-No Roasted potatoes-oK Cappuccino-YES! Croissant-YES Beignets-YES! Order them warm with strawberry purée on the dine-in side. Macaroons-yup: a bit pricey but nice texture and plentiful variety of flavors. Beautiful place and classy service! Do ask the server what is good because some things are a hit and others an outright miss. It is a completely diffeent experience eating on the seated side rather than the cafe (do not recommend the cafe side unless u are buying at the counter and sitting down to eat it:do not order from this side). I would caution against the quiche as well as the lemon ricotta pancakes. However there are many other tasty options which will steer u clear of the rare misses! So glad I stopped into this spot. I was there 3 out of 5 days I visited LA.

i suppose i'm rating the macarons and experience buying them because i have never eaten at the restaurant.  NOTE:  i did not say "YET" to have eaten it seems this is quite the hype type restaurant.  i pass by and wonder why everyone (ANYONE) would want to sit in a big white room with windows for walls.  as if sitting in a gigantic fish tank.  sometimes i'm tempted to tap on the glass to see if anyone of them scurry away. my boyfriend and i were strolling downtown.  smoking some weed you get the munchies.  we happen to be on grand so i said "hey fuck it i'ma get some".  i went in and it was SO LOUD in there.  there isn't much uniformity when it comes to ordering/ lines.  so everyone who wanted pastries was a bit confused.  i didn't want an entire box.  i just wanted to get my sugar fix and try em... shit.  so i tell the guy who's pulling the macarons for you "uhm.. 2 please."  he gives me this look like "REALLY.. TWO!?  HA!  LOOK EVERYONE - SHE... WANTS ONLY 2 PIECES" (hoytee toytee country club voice)  anyway, i pay for my two (finally) and run out... almost breathless.  because of the crowd not because mr macaron was a snob. they were good.

What more can I say about BL that hasn't already been said?? - Awesome portobello fries. You must order these! - Artichoke pizza was light and flavorful. Would order this again! - Eggs benny: A-OK...hollandaise was so-so. Not the best I've ever had - French macaroons. Obvi they are delectable. I ordered 5 and loved them all. Of course they are on the pricier side but they are worth trying. Earl grey was my fave. The only thing I don't like about this place is the noise level. It can get super noisy in here [must be the tall ceilings] and so it was hard for me to have a conversation without raising my voice or asking my bf to repeat what he said. It's a cute date spot if you want to take a girl out..and what girl doesn't love macaroons & desserts!! Will be returning when I have the energy to venture into DTLA haha.

Yelp Gods have done it again, my prayers have been answered! *Endless rows of vibrant colorful picturesque delicious Macarons? FOUND *Displays after displays of exquisite luscious heavenly cakes and tarts? FOUND As Beyonce would say, "if you like it, shoulda put a ring on it." I'd marry Bottega Louie if I could so I could have some if it ERRRR NIGHT! Luxurious doors opened to a realm of dessert paradise. Everywhere I looked I saw mouthwatering cakes, macarons, tarts, cookies, and EVERYTHING YOU EVER DREAMED OF. I ran to the Macarons section and ordered everything I could! You will NOT go wrong with any of the flavors! I got the following: -Passion Fruit -Earl Gray -Rose -Strawberry -Violet Cassis http://www.yelp.com/biz_… http://www.yelp.com/biz_… ABSOLUTELY flavorful, taking my taste buds on a 3 day cruise around the world. Raspberry Saint Amour ($12): 4.5 stars. AMOUR AMOUR AMOUR this dessert! Hahah I dont know how to explain it! It has several layers of wonders. Bottom consists of a tart, on top of it consists of a round raspberry filling, and top layer consisting of raspberry icing. How wonderful can a dessert get? INTENSELY wonderful, Bottega Louie has proven. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Rasperry chocolate cake (SORRY I TOTALLY FORGOT THE NAME OF THIS, but I have a picture!) ($4): 4stars. It was so pretty... the surface reminded me of those seashells with the shiny glares that mesmerizes you for hours. The inside consisted  of chocolate and the shell of the cake was a hard "shell-like" covering. It was pretty rich in flavor! http://www.yelp.com/biz_… This is definitely a "MUST-TRY" Italian Restaurant. It's like a high-end- Beverly - Hills- standard- Italian- dessert-heaven!

5 stars for the Ambiance, Packaging, Portabello Fries, and Macaroons! 2 stars for the service (not enough staff or kind of spacey staff, always have to wave your hand like a douche bag to get their attention) 2 stars for the rest of the menu (over priced and just meh okay) 1 star for parking (expensive garage parking, street meter parking is usually all taken and odd hours) Tip: Avoid coming here on a Friday or Saturday night unless you want to rip a waiters head off, lose your voice and or your mind, or wait in line for 2 hours.

Food is high-quality.  Atmosphere is busy and loud.  Prices are a bit higher than they should be but you're paying for the atmosphere as well.  Would not recommend for small children as there is no kid's menu and it's super loud.   This place is good for getting together with friends or alone.  It was fun to experience, but I don't think I'd go back.

Tons of pictures and reviews so here is mine to throw on the pile - Service, friendly but 'personal' recommendations don't exist. I heard them recommend the lobster Benedict to everybody. Hmm... wonder what item is the highest priced with the highest margins and therefore the highest tip left. - Food, the Lobster Benedict was a mashup of flavors and toppings and they didn't work together. There was no harmony, there was no melancholy, it was a cluster F of crap - The macaroons tasted like they were made out of the different flavors and colors from Fruity Pebbles. I'm 100% positive there is a guy in the back sorting boxes of cereal to melt them down and make macaroons out of them. I'm sorry, when we were trying to relate the flavors, we both were 100% adamant about Fruity Pebbles. We both love Fruity Pebbles too. The ravioli was one ravioli with one egg. Another bait and switch to me because obviously this will not be enough for one person. I hated Paris and I hated the people there and I hated the bait and switch along with the exuberant prices for food. Bottega Louie (which I think is Italian) belongs in Paris... 2 Days in Paris anybody?! Oh, one more thing... trying to order the Macaroons was a cluster F too - Put up some signs or lines please so people aren't just swimming around like a school of fish trying to figure out where to go and what to do. What I do like is if you get a window seat, you get to see all the homeless and weirdos walk by and look at you eating. I'm sure it's entertaining for both parties. Sometimes I think people just think positively about a place because they can't simply be honest and objective and say to themselves "what the heck is all this hype about." What I am saying here is people are lemmings. It's unfortunate but true...

This place is perfection. It really is. I highly recommend the Barrata pizza, but I do with there was more prosciutto on it and maybe cantelope would have also been nice on it.  Even without, it was still amazing. I tried the portobello fries, and they were delish.  The Modena salad was also good, love the creamy balsamic dressing (and I'm not a balsamic person). Butterscotch Budino -- incredible! Kinda reminded me of sticky toffee pudding....but actually in pudding form. :) And of course, the Macaroons. Set of 13 is $28.00 and worth every bite. My faves are the Rose, Earl Grey, Vanilla and Strawberry. Be prepared to wait. I really wish they took dinner reservations, but I guess if they did, I'd never get a table! It's always super packed when I've been (only for dinner), but definitely worth the wait.

I've been here twice, and both times it was incredible. It's hard to find restaurants where both the food and the service is impeccable, but this place definitely has it. The first time I went with 3 friends. We had about a 15 minute wait for a table, but this was defintely quick considering it was packed. We split a margherita and a sausage pizza. All the ingredients were incredibly fresh, and despite being a rather busy Sunday night, both came out pretty quickly. The prices here are also incredible for the quality. Each member of my 4 person party paid $10 for our meal. We also tried the macaroons, which were heavenly. The second time I went was with the same number of people, again on a Sunday night, and it took just as long to be seated as the first time. This time we split another margherita pizza and bruschetta. The bruschetta is the best I've ever had, and they pile on the tomatoes. My friends also ordered the salmon crudo and grilled artichokes, and said both were amazing. Both times the staff were very attentive, making sure everything was good, and that our water glasses were filled. What I love about this place is that you can watch the chefs prepare all the dishes through glass windows. The only complaint I'd have is that the bread is pretty tough, but once you actually bite a piece off, it's delicious as well. I'd come back here anytime I was nearby.

This place is fancy-shmancy looking! We came here for a surprise birthday party and it definitely started off badly.  You can give them your name when you get there, but until your whole party is there, you aren't put on the wait list.  I think that is ridiculous since one of friends went at least 1.5 hours earlier so that we could have a table by the time the birthday girl got there. They are not accommodating at all for surprises or anything with someone being late. Parking is street parking or you could park in the parking garages etc all around. Upon walking in, there is a pastry/desserts area where they sell different desserts including macaroons.  Walking further in the dining area is split in two, the first part being casual dining meshed with the bar and then finally the more formal area.  I thought the way they set up where the hostesses were taking reservations wasn't that great.  People form a line to put their name down, but then they get mixed in with people waiting for a seat in the casual dining area or with people who already put their names down and are simply waiting. While waiting for the birthday girl, we got drinks in the bar/casual dining area.  We asked if we could transfer our tab to the table, but the server said no, which was fine.  Our friend was going to pay for the drinks so some of us started walking to get our table before it was given up.  The server basically flagged me down and made it seem like I was running out on the bill. Uhh no, see my friend holding the check in his hand? And see the fact that I am going to dinner and not walking towards the exit? It was ever so slightly awkward. When we finally got to our table, our server was great.  Bread was served and we all got water. We ordered quite a lot of food. The portobello fries were good, but it was the sauce that made it great.  I even used the sauce for other dishes we ordered. The calamari was good. Scallops were great. The pizza (artichoke) wasn't amazing, but it was good.  I thought it was slightly too salty though, like there were actual grains of salt on the pizza. The ceviche was good and so were the mashed potatoes. The chocolate souffle was great! I loved the sauce that comes with it! I ordered macaroons to go for my parents, $26 for 13 I think.  They flavors were great! I highly recommend trying the earl grey tea and rose ones! They are all good though, but be careful to not eat too many.  They are so sweet!

I came here on Wednesday before Thanksgiving hoping to get breakfast.  But of course, one thing led to another, and by the time we came in, it was noon.  No more breakfast! OH WELL.   For 2, the wait was only 10-15 minutes.  The host gave us an option to sit in the bar/cafe area, which is open seating but we opted for the dining room.  Between two people, we ordered the mushroom pizza, a french onion soup, and the portobello fries. The mushroom pizza was bomb.  So were the portobello fries.  The fries were fried perfectly crispy with a really great dipping sauce.  The french onion soup was big.  There was a little bit too much cheese in my opinion.   Overall, super cute restaurant and good food.

Fantastic experience. Portobello fries were perfectly crisp. Brussel sprouts werw a delectable balance between healthy and sinfully delicious. Lamb & baby potatoes cooked tender & moist. Goat cheese on the salad with vinaigrette was excellent. Paired with the malbec and it was amazing. Of course, my favorite part of the dinner was the dessert. Le grand macaron (macaron, with one O) is ABSOLUTELY TO DIE FOR ... and I don't even like raspberries all that much. Ha! It was truly scrumptious!!! I cannot wait until next time :-)

Love, love, love, love, love!!!  I was in L.A. for the weekend and staying downtown, so I looked up restaurants within walking distance of the hotel.  Bottega Louie came up and I just made a mental note of it for when I actually arrived in California.  Once I saw Bottega Louie, I was in awe.  It is the perfect restaurant for me.  I loved the clean, white decor and bright lights with the contrasting colorful pastries and boxes. We dropped in for dinner and there were so many people in the restaurant - people sitting, people standing, people everywhere.  I thought the wait would be at least an hour, but I went up to the hostess anyway and put our name down.  Surprisingly, we only had to linger around for 10 or 15 minutes until we were found by a host and seated by the kitchen/prep area.  It was fun watching the chefs and waiters/waitresses bustling about. I ordered Tomato Bruschetta and Clam Linguini.  The bruschetta was good, you get three slices - the tomatoes were piled on, seemed fresh, and garlicy.  They were a little difficult to eat though since the tomatoes kept falling off.  My entree order was mixed up somehow and the waiter brought out actual clams instead of what I ordered.  I explained that I actually ordered the pasta with clams so they took away the mistake dish and brought out the pasta.  The serving size is kind of small compared to chain restaurants, but it was perfect for me.  The Clam Linguini could've been more flavorful, it wasn't memorable and I didn't enjoy it as much as the bruschetta. For dessert, I ordered the Butterscotch Budino.  It was cool, creamy, and not too sweet.  Of course, I had to buy other dessert items on my way out.  It was pretty late into the night so the variety was slim.  I got two macarons (I think espresso and Earl Grey), a raspberry mousse thing, and a pistachio cupcake, all of which were good.  I'm excited to come back and visit during the day, so I can try different menu items and have a larger selection of pastries to choose from.  I wish there was a Bottega Louie in Seattle, I would go all the time!

Breakfast review. The breakfast here is a little pricy but you should know that before coming in. There are cheaper options like potato pancakes for 5$ or new York egg sandwich for $8. I tried the eggs Benedict and the NY egg sandwich. Both delicious NY egg sandwich was a big portion. Came with two fried eggs and two big slices of bacon. Eggs Benedict was cooked to perfection. The spinach made it different and the holidase sauce made well. Coffee was strong for those coffee lovers. yum.

Whenever I'm in LA I try to squeeze in a trip to Bottega Louie. I love their burrata appetizer and pizza, so good!! Every time I go I also get the Italian Chopped salad, love it. And their macarons are super yummy. Oh, and the complimentary sparkling water is a nice touch! The downsides for me are the high ceilings...they look cool but it makes the place feel cold, and it gets soo loud! Whenever you are with a big group you can barely hear anyone across the table. Their bread is also a little crispy for my liking. But that burrata tho....

I had first stepped into Bottega Louie prior to a concert being held at the Staples Center and had to leave due to time constraints.  I finally got my chance to try it last night, and I'm glad I returned. When you walk into the restaurant you're greeted by their desert case showcasing their macaroon selection.  The host stand is in the middle of the restaurant near the bar.  You can look to your right and see food being prepared in the open kitchen, and  flying doughs of pizza will catch your eye in the back right.  We arrived a little early to try and reduce the wait time, and I'm glad the wait wasn't as bad as what others had told me. We started with the Modena salad, where the butter lettuce was presented in a bloom pattern.  The salad was tasty, and didn't come with too much dressing.  The Burrata pizza was next, the crust is thin and crispy, but easy to handle [doesn't fold or droop].  We also ordered the asparagus & poached egg, although I'm not sure what the poached egg added to the asparagus.  It was good, but didn't really differentiate itself from other restaurants. Butterscotch Budino was ordered for dessert; it was sweet but didn't have an overpowering butterscotch taste. I had about a third of it, and my sweet tooth was more than satisfied.   Lets not forget the Macaroons.... what a variety!  We selected a variety to go and they're nothing short of delicious. Botegga Louie's menu has a couple if items boxed, perhaps indicating it's special.  I thought it was odd to see a hamburger on the menu, but it looked legit. The Chocolate Souffle is the other "featured item". The food is good, but I'm sure if I would but I'm not sure if I would be willing to wait an hour or more for a table.

Wow, I haven't written a review in nearly two months. Blame it on the ludicrous number of back to back papers that were due leading up to finals week. Now that I'm on break and somewhat stress-free, I thought Bottega Louie would be a good place to start with in terms of Yelp review-ing. I had always wanted to try their macarons, which I heard were simply exquisite. So when my friend from up north came down to visit me, I jumped at the opportunity to drive to Downtown LA and check BL out! Here's a forewarning for potential visitors: Bottega Louie is big, spacious, and very nice... but the noise volume can get out of control. It's a nice place for a date, but make sure your love-interest has an audible voice, otherwise it could get awkward fast. I mean, I could barely hear my server speak... Anyway, I've been here twice now, and each time was great. This place is literally heaven on earth, especially if you enjoy DESSERTS. There are rows and rows of delectable pastries, cakes, tarts, eclairs, etc. You name it, they got it. I've had the Pistachio Saint Amour ($12), most of their macaron flavors ($2.00 each), and a vanilla cream pastry that had an abstract name ($9?). A weetle pricey, but it's not like you're gonna make these things at home. Because you probably can't. Or if you can, yours probably wouldn't taste as good. As for their lunch/dinner menu items, I've had the Mache salad, Mediterranean mussels, fried calamari, Porchetta sandwich, and mushroom pizza. And let me tell you, THEIR MUSHROOM PIZZA IS THE BOMB. The rest were good too, but the Porchetta sandwich was only okay. I'm definitely looking to try all their other pizzas. And their brunch menu (Can you say SMOKED SALMON BENEDICT?) All in all, YUMMY. I can say with 100% confidence that Bottega Louie is one of the many reasons I love Los Angeles.

The food is GOOD! Most important the service was awesome. When we walked in and wondered towards desserts area, the person with the smile offered us help. The hostess was great too, took us few minutes to have the table and while waiting she was very welcoming. The waiter was very cool, we got what he recommend and the food was delicious! The reason I put 4 stars, not 5 is that the atmosphere reminded me cafeteria, too opened, too plain, no privacy, too noisy. & I had greater expectations of Chocolate Soufle. I expected melted chocolate in a middle, smoothly melting out of it. Yet in contrast with cuteness of presentation of food, the soufle came in as a big chocolate baked things without chocolate in side :( they had condensed milk on a side, which was nice, but won't do it for chocolate lovers.

McKayla Maroney is not impressed. My wife discovered this place from a friend of hers. We came her a couple times for the macaroons, but never had the opportunity to try the food. Unfortunately for me, this place attracts my wife like a 3 year old watching Teletubbies. Damn you colorful macaroons! Last night, after the Clippers vs. Warriors game, we decided to grab a couple macaroons before heading back to OC. I figured if I make wifey watching basketball game, the least I can do is get some macaroons. One of my pet peeves about coming here is the ridiculously shotty parking situation. Unless you want to pay 5-6 bucks parking in one of the structures in the area, good luck finding street parking. After 20 minutes of circling the the effin' place, I threw in the towel and settled for structure parking. To our surprise, there was no wait for food. We decided to try the pizza that all you fools' been raving about. The group decided to go with the BURRATA - Burrata, Grana parmesan, rapini, garlic, extra virgin olive oil & prosciutto di Parma as our late night snack. I tell you. NOT IMPRESSED. First off, the pizza literally took 2 minutes to come out. It was obviously pre-cooked and just reheated, because it was luke warm. Heavy in dried garlic, a sliver of prosciutto, and the cold blob of Burrata cheese just did not work for anyone at the table. The atmosphere was cool, but the trendy crowd made this little Washington Wizards fan a little uncomfortable. My choice of oversized basketball jersey received a lot of judgmental scoffs. Don't worry Project Runway, I'm going to eat my cold pizza and bounce. Macaroons are good. My favorite is the salted caramel. Definitely overpriced and undersized. I honestly don't know what the big fuss is about. A little about my credentials: I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world.

I came here after work with some friends one time, and really enjoyed the environment and the food here. It is a little chaotic especially when everyone just got off work, but it definitely has a different crowd than all other restaurants in town. There's no happy hours..or maybe i just don't recall if there was any. But the lasagna was good and I really enjoyed my wine here too.  I remember asking for a sample, and the waiter literally give me a quarter glass of wine which I was really happy to drink, and finish a glass and the sample for the price of 12 dollars. Bottega is also known for their pastries, so we got a box of macarons to share, and they were pretty darn delicious as our dessert. It is a little pricy if you get the box (I think it cost extra for the box alone) but it was such a cute box that we have to get it. So overall, I enjoyed my meal and dessert here and definitely would want to come back to eat here again! The parking structure behind bottega is around 3 bucks or you can try street parking which is frustrating and hard to find! so better just pay 3 bucks to save some headache.

Friend: So where should I take my girl? Me: Bottega Louie Friend: Why? Me: Imagine a designer clothes store filled with desserts, it's like being in Louis Vuitton while eating marshmallows... Friend: Touche The store is all white with giant columns, white tables with gold plating framed around the ceiling. There's also a bakery place filled with all kinds of treats, especially the mountain of macaroons. You can also watch them make pizzas because the pizza kitchen has glass screens. I ordered: 1) Riggatoni which is like hard pasta with tomato sauce and little pieces of salisbury steak- The dish was solid and It cost me about $16. 2) Portobello mushroom pizza- Solid pizza, I've had better pizza at other places. 3) Eggs benedict- It was pretty runny... 4) Earl Grey and Cruz macaroon- Arguably the best macaroon I've ever had. I loved how the Earl Grey have specks of gold on it and the rich dark chocolate in the cruz. However, for $2 per macaroon, it's also the most expensive macaroon I've bought. Overall,  the food is pricey and slightly above average. However, the decor of the place and the dessert according to girls "just magical." So far, the only two places that I know girls describing as magical are Disneyland and Bottega Louie. Therefore,  gentlemen, take your ladies here and she will love it!

Bottega Louie is very white and very loud. I couldn't hear my friend I was with. The server asked if she wanted pepper on her salad and she said no. Then he put pepper on her salad. So, I assume if your order gets messed up, it's purely because the servers can't hear what you are even saying. The food was mediocre. The mushroom fries were mediocre. Mediocre food, loud, and questionable service.

Stopped by here for macarons several times after a happy hour elsewhere and been to a Sunday brunch once. This place is too loud all week around (their high ceiling and openness of the seating area is to blame I think).  During peak days, it gets too crowded aggravating the noise  issue to a whole new level.  On one occasion, we had to change our meeting spot for a birthday party because it is just too loud.   Most of the times, I don't stay in the venue longer than, say, 15 minutes since we're getting some sweets to go but that one Sunday brunch gave me a headache already from all the echoing in the building. Awesome desserts, the food was okay (I remember getting some sort of eggs benedict or scramble and asparagus - not memorable at all).  Pretentious crowd....I'll pass.

The beginning of my Bottega Louie experience was fantastic.  I loved walking in and seeing the rows and rows of macarons followed by a glass case of other delectable desserts. However, it went downhill from there for the next TWO HOURS OF WAITING. They do not take reservations, and we were told that the wait for a party of 6 would be 45 minutes to an hour.  After an hour passed, we went up to inquire about the wait and they told us there were still SIX large parties in front of us.  And so we stood and waited for yet another hour. After inquiring yet again about the wait, the manager himself came out to apologize, seated us, thanked us profusely for our patience, and threw in two portobello fries on the house, which were AMAZING. Among the things we had, a few dishes really stood out (aside from the portobello fries).  The pastas in particular were great.  The Trenne (Pan sautéed trenne pasta with braised prime rib eye, Tuscan black kale & shaved Grana parmesan) was so flavorful (perhaps a tad salty), which was accentuated by the pan fry.  The orchiette was also delicious.  The chocolate souffle was AMAZING vanilla bean (I think?) sauce they pour in, but they are large so plan on sharing. The macarons are a tad on the expensive side ($2 each) but the flavors are rich and spot on. Overall, great food that I would love to try again.  However, we are all a little hesitant to return because of the long wait we had to experience.

Went for X-mas lunch with a group of co-workers.  I love the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant.  I ordered the Chicken Pilliard recommended by the waiter.  Others had the braised short rib, linguini clam pasta, octopus, and another pasta dish with some type of braised meat.  Honestly, the food did not hit the spot.  None of the dishes I tried entice me to come back.  The flavor of the food was pretty standard.  I would possibly round to 3.5 star.   I do not eat deserts enough to judge from that perspective.  Some people go crazy for the macaroons and the assortment does look awesome.

Despite how crowded this place was when we came here on a Saturday afternoon, we were seated right away which was pretty awesome.  Everything after that was kind of hit-or-miss.   We were seated in a small booth crammed into the corner of the restaurant and there was no way to squeeze in between the tables without knocking into other tables, kind of annoying.  Very annoying when the waitress for the table next to us was leaning her butt on my pizza because the tables were so close together.  However, there was an unintended benefit to having the tables so close together: having the privilege of listening to other diners conversations.  The greatest moment of the night came when I heard the following come from the table next to ours which was occupied by a couple on a date together; "What? You told me that she was just your roommate.  You never said you were married."  The rest as you can imagine was pure gold.   As far as the food and service went, it was far from impressive.  Our waiter was very nice, but it took him forever for him to get us everything.  10 minutes for him to show up to take our drink order, 10 minutes later my girlfriend gets her diet Coke, 10 minutes later I get my iced tea, 10 minutes later we get the bread we asked for, and so on.  He even completely forgot to put in the order for the Caesar salad we asked for so we never got to even try that.  Kind of frustrating all evening long. The food itself had a couple of great moments and some let-downs.  As countless others have mentioned, the portobello fires were phenomenal.  My girlfriend, who hates mushrooms, loved them and we had to fight for the scraps in the bottom of the container.  For our entrees, my girlfriend ordered the lasagna, which she really enjoyed, and said the sauce to cheese to pasta ratio was perfect.  I had the burrata pizza, and while it was pretty good, I didn't think it was anything spectacular.  I would say about 1/3 of the pizza is the crust, and there is not that much actual pizza to be had.  I could probably name off about a dozen places that have better pizza. After our dinners, we of course had to try dessert, hoping that this place would redeem itself with some of its signature baked goods.  We decided to split the chocolate soufflé since that seemed to be the most popular dessert item.  The menu says to give about 15 minutes for the kitchen to prepare the item, but of course since we were dealing with our waiter, we had to add an extra 10 minutes to that.  When we got the soufflé I felt like it tasted just like hot chocolate cake, with melted vanilla ice cream on top of.  It was good, but not spectacular like everyone raves about.  We also ordered five of the macarons because I was mesmerized by all the colors when we first walked in the restaurant.  I have to say these were the best part of the experience, and probably the only reason I gave this place as many stars as I did.  The Earl Grey and Matcha macarons were some of the most unique and delicious cookies I have ever tried, and worth the $2 each price tag for a dessert that amounts to two bites. Overall, this place was decent, a little bit over-rated, and not quite sure how Yelp rated this the best restaurant in the US a couple years ago?  When I'm in the area in the future, I would probably only go here to get some macarons to-go, or maybe try their brunch, but only if there is a minimal wait.

FINALLY got my butt over here after hearing my friends talk about it literally for years.... My bf and I went for lunch on Monday around noon and it was kind of stressful to find parking. We ended up parking in the lot on the same block behind the restaurant which was $8 so that was kind of annoying -__- It was really cool to see all of the desserts and macaroons right away when you walk in but you have to weave through a bunch of people to find the hostess who is pretty far inside from the entrance. She was very nice and we had to wait around 10-15 minutes for a table but it didn't seem that long because we were watching the kitchen staff prepare food and drooling over the desserts in the display cases. Once we were seated I noticed it was really loud because it was hard to hear what my boyfriend was saying even though he was just across the table! That was really annoying. Our waiter was awesome! He was really on top of everything and aware of what we needed at all times. We ordered the minestrone soup ($8), the portobello fries ($10) and the lasagna ($16). After waiting awhile people who arrived after us were getting food so we were wondering what was going on. There must have been a mistake in the kitchen but our waiter brought us some bread until they could bring our food out so that was really nice of him! I was getting antsy since the food was taking forever but once it arrived it was AMAZING! This place was totally redeemed by the food. The portobello fries were so meaty and good and the basil garlic aioli sauce was to DIE FOR! we even asked for more because it was soooo yummmy! The minestrone was great, full of vegetables, meat and kale leaves. The lasagna though was excellent. You could taste the wine in the meat sauce and I don't really like cheese but this cheese was superb. Only complaint was it could have used more sauce and there were too many layers of pasta but still TASTY! Oh and we couldn't pass the macaroons by so we got 5 flavors ($10): vanilla, raspberry, strawberry, earl grey, and violet cassis. I LOVED the vanilla and the earl grey was quite good. My boyfriend really enjoyed the strawberry because it was filled with jam. This place was pretty pricey but I'm glad I got to check it out finally!

The wait can be pretty horrendous, but once you finally make it inside and get seated then it is a pleasurable experience. Portobello fries: DELICIOUS! At most places you would think they are cheap about the portobello fries, but here the fries are cut thick and are huge. The aioli that they serve alongside is perfect for the portobello fries. A must try! Mushroom pizza (w/o olives): The mushroom flavor definitely comes through even though it is combined with pepperoni. The only bad thing about the pizza is that after the first alive, the second slice is already cold. I do love cold pizza, but this pizza definitely tastes better when it's nice and hot. Macarons: I got to try the earl grey, matcha, espresso, violet cassis, and raspberry. I must say the earl grey was at the top of my list. The flavor was beautiful! Nutella beignet: WOW! The beignet was nice and warm and filled with a ridiculous amount of Nutella filling. I would make my way to Bottega just for this! It's insanely delicious!   **I highly suggest going early. I once went on a Saturday night around 8pm and it was a 3 hour wait!

The waitress recommended the Orecchiette but I immediately regretting ordering the dish. For some reason broccolini and the rainbow chard was just too bitter for me. I did get a chance to try some of my friend's dish which was the clam linguini, unfortunately the clams tasted very chewy and were probably overcooked. It was probably a good thing that the pasta dishes weren't that great. Since I had more room to savor the entrees. The pork chops and short ribs were cooked to perfection. The short ribs were so tender, that you could eat it with just a fork! The pork chops were not overcooked and were very moist. The portobello fries are a must have, although it could use a little less batter.

4 stars for the how well organized their entire staffs are. From the front desk host/hostess to the bus boys and open kitchen chefs. It's pretty amazing to see process and procedures defined and executed to this level. Food is not bad but not the reason why this place is so successful. Again, amazing... just amazing job on the training and control points.

I absolutely love the loud and bustling ambience of Bottega Louie!  Its vibe is reminiscent of NYC restaurants and for anyone like myself who loves NYC but doesn't have the chance to fly out there often, coming here is an easy way to transport yourself! :)   AMBIENCE/DECOR: It is loud!  High ceilings and all-window walls create the perfect acoustics for a buzzing place.  Do not come here if you're looking to have a quiet and peaceful meal.  Do come if you are looking for an EXCELLENT dining experience in a vibrant setting with AWESOMELY attentive service.  Oh, and the BEAUTIFUL people!  I've dined here a number of times - for lunch and dinner, on weekends and weeknights - and I have no idea where these people come from but many of the patrons AND the servers make me feel like I'm on a Hollywood movie set!  Everyone is just super sexxxaaay here!  So, moving on to my next comment... DRESS CODE: Business casual attire, semi-formal or trendy.  Just don't look disheveled :) Here are some of the food items I've tried... BRUNCH - Eggs Benedict - Excellent! - Lemon Ricotta Pancakes - Yummmm! DINNER - Portobello Fries, $10.  Oily but I liked the long, big chunks of portobello; no skimping here. - Diver Scallops, $12.  Two HUGE scallops perfectly seared on the outside and juicy and tender on the inside. - Sauteed Broccolini, $8.  Perfectly cooked and a great way to get your greens! - Meatballs Marinara, $10.  Huge and juicy. Again, no skimping here! - Bianco Pizza, $20.  Ricotta, mozzarella, Grana parmesan, roasted garlic and wild rocket arugula.  Excellent! - Napoli Pizza, $20.  Mozzarella, Grana parmesan, tomato sauce, oregano, red onions, white mushrooms and olives.  Excellent! - Trenne, $14.  Pan-sautéed trenne pasta with braised prime rib eye, Tuscan black kale and shaved Grana parmesan.  First time eating it; good but wish I knew to expect "tough" pasta. ******Trenne: The pasta is pan-sautéed so it's crispy on the outside and chewy inside.  It reminded me of fried mochi.  It wasn't bad but since I was expecting the regular kind of pasta,  it was a negative surprise to me.  However, knowing what the dish is now, I would order it if I craved this sort of pasta texture.  The sauce was a little rich for me; it certainly wasn't lacking in the flavor department.   DESSERT - Panna Cotta, $9.  Citrus vanilla panna cotta, blood orange gelée, candied almonds and seasonal fruit.  WOW, super delish!  The blood orange gelée complements the creamy panna cotta really well. This is a "must try" :) NOTE:  The Club Sandwich looks AMAZING!  I've yet to try this but have taken a mental note to try it on my next visit after seeing soooo many tables order it.  Curiosity always gets the best of me. TIP #1 The wait can be long at times so grab a drink or purchase a box of macaroons at the bakery near the entrance :) TIP #2 The entrees are great but if you want to try a little bit of everything, I recommend ordering a bunch of small plates and eating "family style" with your group.  That's what I did on my first visit to BL and that was enough for me to keep coming back to try the rest of their menu :)

I went here to get Macaroons for my girlfriend at the time cause she loves them. I was hungry so I thought I might as well treat myself. I have been here 5 times. Mainly to get Macaroons. 14 different flavors by the way. I have had brunch and Dinner here.                  These are the items I had along with my opinion of them. Brunch: *Eggs Benedict which contained Poached eggs, Canadian bacon, spinach, & hollandaise sauce on an English muffin. was so good. all the ingredients meshed well and was fulfilling. * SALMON MILLEFEUILLE Smoked salmon, capers & crème fraîche layered with puff pastry. I cannot tell you how many times I go somewhere and I have to send the salmon back. Didn't have to do this here and I was stunned by how  tasteful it was. Dinner: *TAGLIATELLE BOLOGNESE Traditional Bolognese meat ragù with béchamel & Grana Parmesan. All I can say is what a delight for the mouth.   When I go back I will update this post or create a new one pertaining to this restaurant. I recommend to eat there at least once I am sure that's all it will take to make you a fan.

I wish I was rich enough to live the good life in LA. Even the macaroons are fancy in better places and this place was definitely jaw dropping. I had to stop by this place during my trip to SoCal. I expected a cute NorCal small bakery but boy was I wrong. ( Note to self: Always dress nice when you explore LA, even when you decide to go get macaroons). This place is amazing. I felt like a little girl in a grown up sweets factory. The decor is fantastic and everything is so bright and happy. Customer service was amazing even though I only ordered macaroons. The choices for macaroons seemed never ending. The hardest part for me was choosing 5 flavors to get. (2nd Note to self: get the big box next time!! so worth the money for $26! Especially if you decide to split it with someone). Every single flavor was delicious. The macaroons were moist and sweet. Remember to get the beignet. I regret only buying 1... I was a fool. I'm definitely getting a dozen+ next time since it's only $1 each!   + Salted Caramel  + Passionfruit    +Vanilla     + Hazelnut ( but really though... just get all flavors) I can't wait to journey down to LA again for some good macaroons. Since I just discovered that it was also a restaurant, I'm so excited to try their food.

I've been meaning to yelp this place forever because it has FANTASTIC pizza. Bianco Pizza is to die for! A lest I forget...their elder flower martini's are exquisite. The hostesses are hit or miss...usually sporting that snotty LA grimace...but in fairness to them it is loud in there. REALLY LOUD. the acoustics and minimalist decor combined with ambient lighting do make it upbeat and pleasant.

Probably one of the best restaurants I've ever had the pleasure of eating at.  Just about everything is good except for the hard/crunchy chewy pasta.  I forgot the name but if you read the pasta portion of the menu and it mentions hard or crunchy, stay away from it. trust me.  Aside from that, just about everything on the dinner menu is delicious-especially the pizza.  Give it a try, I know you'll love it.  Side Note: I do not work for, own, or know any of the staff or crew at this restaurant.  It is just DAM GOOD place to eat, and probably one of the best restaurants I've ever eaten at in terms of both quality ad quantity.  It  ain't  cheap, but it is definitely worth your while and money to try. Special Note about how I rate food on yelp:  Please remember guys and gals, I'm not the type to be vindictive against restaurants with bad service or what not.  My reviews are based strictly and objectively on how the food tastes, not on service.  If the food is awesome and the service sucks I'll still give a 4 or 5 rating.  If the food sucks but the service is excellent and they treat me like a king, I'll still give either 1 or 2 star rating.  For me it's all about the food and how my tummy feels afterwards. =)

I just feel like I have to review Bottega Louie, and I have to give them five stars. I've been to Bottega Louie quite a few times for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and have had a great experience every time. Food: Smoked Salmon Benedict Pancetta Buratta Scramble Portobello Fries Buratta Pizza Bianco Pizza Californian Sandwich Ambiance: Big, beautiful older room. High ceilings so it can get really loud. A lot of business people since its located in downtown, often see couples and crowds. I just really appreciate the business model that these people have put together. They serve an extremely high volume of people, food tastes great, usually comes out in good time, you get to see the cooks prepare your food, the service is great, i like that the waiters/waitresses typically call you mr. or ms. so and so. i think they provide better customer service than a lot of restaurants half their size. It, for the most part, seems like a well oiled machine...with class. oh right and the desserts. honestly, i'm not a big sweets person. i've on occasion had some macarons here and they haven't disappointed. but the truth is, i come for the food and a little bit of a feel for what downtown la probably used to be like.

Guys: Take your lady-friend-that-you-want-to-impress to Botegga Louie. Ladies: Imagine a designer clothes store filled with desserts, it's like being in Louis Vuitton while eating marshmallows. (I stole this review, btw). Guys: Lamb Chops - $25...but just awesome. Ladies: You'll describe this place as magical.

I wish I could give this place NO stars for their terrible and RUDE manager. I've grown up in the restaurant business and this guy shouldn't be in this type of career. LA might be full of rude people, but he shouldn't assume all people are like that from the moment he first interacts with them. They need to CHECK their managers... Their food is NOT all that - check out their portobello fries (because that's all that's really stand out-ish here), so for something like this to happen, I DON'T need to be back.  Take your dollars elsewhere - walk in, buy some macarons and other goodies at the bakery section... but have your dinner elsewhere!

My friend and I went for brunch at Bottega Louie on a Sunday morning. We decided to go early around 10am to avoid a long queue. We did not have to wait for a table, but we were confused about whom to follow. There were about 5-6 hosts standing at the front desk, and our host did not even gesture to us to follow him. Our waiter was friendly and efficient, but I didn't like that he only recommended the most expensive items on the menu. At least be subtle by throwing in a few of the less expensive ones too. The freshly squeezed OJ ($5) was delicious, but the eggs benedict ($12) were just okay. The side salad was a little sad with only a few pieces of lettuce and one tomato (halved). For dessert, we ordered the peanut butter terrine ($9) for dessert, which my friend thought tasted like a "fancy Butterfinger." It didn't quite live up to the description. I also picked up a strawberry macaron ($2), which was not bad, but not anything special. There are better patisseries for French macarons. The food is average, but I find the interior and ambience excellent. The tall ceilings, large windows, and white paint of the restaurant are so elegant; and the colorful dessert display nearby provide a fun touch. Parking lots nearby are easy to find, but they will cost $6-7.

I've dined at Bottega Louie three times in the past five days. Twice for dinner, once for brunch, and all three times for the portobello fries! The Good: The venue is gorgeous. High vaulted ceilings, a beautiful dessert display, huge open kitchen, & decor that screams Parisian luxury! The portobello fries are good. They are better with the basil aioli and even better yet still for a mushroom lover like myself. I also really enjoyed the short ribs here. A tender & juicy cut drenched in flavor and served with polenta. YUM! Lastly, I can't go without mentioning their desserts. Chocolate souffle & macarons... Um, will you marry me? The ones that really stood out were the salted caramel, grand cru & rose. Don't leave without trying the macarons!! The Bad: I am an avid brunch-goer and there's nothing quite like a well-made eggs benedict. I had heard great things about the smoked salmon benedict here. Long story short... not worth the hype. Pocket your $18 and try the one at "Little Next Door" -- it'll blow you away! The Ugly: We ordered 2 pizzas -- the burrata & the mushroom -- and they came out burnt on the bottom. Did I really just spend $40 on burnt pizza?! Everything about the pizzas left me unimpressed and underwhelmed. Good to know: It gets pretty loud here around dinner time. Not ideal for whispering sweet nothings into her ear. Intimate date-seekers take it elsewhere!

I would say if you want to take a huge party here, make sure you all get there together and that you go when you're not starving because you will have to wait a long time. I would suggest that you don't, but hey we did it so it's possible. They won't try and seat you until you all are there and it's very likely that you won't be able to all sit together anyways. Unless you want to wait even longer. Otherwise, I would definitely return for a date or a lunch with close friends. The atmosphere definitely doesn't match the way it looks. When I first saw pictures of it, I thought it was going to be a quiet cafe, but it was actually really crowded, busy, and loud. There are three parts to Bottega Louie: bakery (known for macarons), bar, and restaurant. So you can definitely walk in for any of these or go for all three. I definitely recommend the burrata pizza. They are also known for they portobello mushroom fries. It's a little pricey, but I think you'll understand what you're paying for once you're there. Most trendy places are like that anyways.

I came here two years ago on a Saturday evening and experienced an hour wait, so we came in at 4:30pm this time. It was still crowded but not overwhelming, and we were seated rather quickly. Service was friendly and swift. We started off with complimentary bread and butter. The baguette was rock-hard and the butter was frozen. Rejects from their bakery? Bottega seems to have a problem with their bread considering this was the second time we received rock bread. Anyway, I tried their portobello fries, lobster nage, trenne, carpaccio, and salmon crudo. The portobello fries were still good. Savory but heavy, thus great for sharing. The lobster nage was the table favorite. It was lobster tail meat in a thin, briny soup made from the actual lobster "juice." It's brininess paired nicely with the sweet raisins and almonds, and cauliflower panna cotta which was identical to soft tofu. Delicious! The trenne was also quite good. It consisted of sauteed trenne pasta, braised beef, black kale, and shaved parmesan in a stew-flavored sauce. The pasta had the same flavor and texture as thick, crunchy potsticker skin... What an analogy. The hearty, mildly spicy dish was not what we had expected but very tasty. We didn't enjoy the salmon crudo and carpaccio. The salmon crudo consisted of salmon sashimi marinated in a salty juice and topped with crunchy cucumbers and sage. It was way too salty and completely overwhelmed the salmon. The carpaccio was heavily marinated in lemon juice and topped with crisp veggies. I like being able to taste the freshness of raw fish and beef so these dishes didn't do it for me. Anjin serves some great carpaccio: http://www.yelp.com/biz/… Overall, the food was decent but my friends and I enjoyed the bustling ambiance. Bottega Louie is somewhere I'd like to come once a year just to hang out. I would like to come back soon for brunch though. One day I will buy a 45-box of their colorful macarons!

Came here with a party of 8 so not being able to reserve is slightly off-putting but I guess neither can anyone else so it really depends on how lucky you are. There's street parking and a valet service for $6 but there's also lots that are $5 on the weekdays and $4 on the weekends. Also the place is in the middle of downtown so you're really at the mercy of traffic oh which ever day you choose to go. The place is really loud. Like, really loud. It's just one big room that seats everyone and everyone just yells or something. Definitely not a place to be.. intimate per se. But with a group of friends who you can be loud with, yah it's a good place to go without people getting mad at you for yelling. The food is yummy. The portobello fries is definitely something to try. The menu features a decent variety from meat to seafood to pasta. It's definitely a meal that you can choose how fancy you want to make it. You have casually priced items from 10-16 or you can get fancy and get a nice prime rib. But pricing wise, it's really not too bad. There are even small plates in the event that you're not too hungry. Pinot Grigio was a good wine, supposedly. The bakery is so cute! I just want to eat everything... The macaroons come in a cute little box and there are lots of variety of those as well. Fairly standard in terms of pricing ($2 per) and taste. But the box is super cute. The food isn't good enough for me to want to drive all the way to downtown to eat but overall it's a nice place to go, hang out, be loud, get a bite to eat, snack when I'm in the area.

OH MY! the wait was about 1 to 2 hours for us. They said it was worth it, so we took the chance and put our name down on a Saturday night. While waiting, we drank some wine and ordered some macaroons on the side. YES, macaroons! they had a mini french bakery inside the restaurant and I must say, it was not only pretty, but it was DELICIOUS! The restaurant was super packed. It felt like there were about 500 or more people inside this small restaurant. I wish they can make the restaurant bigger! and I wish they have nicer hosts because they gave us a pretty straight face the whole time and ignored mostly everyone that was asking questions. (I guess they got overwhelmed by the crowd) On the other hand, the manager was very helpful! he took care of us and made sure we get our table. Our server was super kind and sweet and we all had a great and wonderful dinner time. We were stuffed and left with a big smile on our face. Super cute restaurant! love the concept and I will definitely come back. BUT this time, I'll go when it's not super crazy busy though. I don't think I can wait for an hour or more to be seated to eat..........

Years later, this is still one of my favorite places to eat in downtown.  The place is a little loud at times, but it's worth it. Any of the pizzas are amazing.  Their french onion soup is amazing.  Their brunch is amazing.  Their cocktails are great (I'd recommend trying a moscow mule).  Their creme brule is good as well.  I honestly can't remember what else I've had there, but I've always enjoyed what was ordered. The staff is very attentive as well.  They really know the menu well and are good at answering any questions you may have, as long as they aren't about the French Revolution. They don't take reservations, but there's plenty to keep you busy while you wait.  Ladies, take a gander at all the pastries and chocolates.  I'm not one for macaroons, but their other pastries are great.  Gentlemen, just stop for a moment and take a look into the fully open kitchen.  It's immaculate and everyone there is working beautifully together.  It's like watching a culinary ballet. If I had a friend who was in LA for only one night, this is one of the places I'd recommend for dinner.

Let's be real, if you're in search of fine dining over candlelight, Bottega probably  isn't the place for you. What I will definitely vouch for is the eye candy that always seems to wander amid their staff. Come to think of it.... I think I'll give you guiz' one more star just for NOT hiring ugly people! Yes, dammit, I said it! {Don't judge} Anyway, as Christina B. stated within an earlier review - this place makes Magic Mountain look like the Downtown Library with reference to noise control. The ceilings, while vaulted and stunning - create the most loud, opera-like environment you'd ever dream of. In addition, for some odd reason, I'm always seated by the window. Note to self: Buy more Gucci, lol. With retrospect to this, I did once have the pleasure of having one of Downtown's transients spit upon my window while I dined at this establishment with friends. That was uhm.....interesting. Chalk that up to LAPD not being on their job... What's left to say? The Portobello fries are to die for alongside the caesar salad served with wedged Romaine. Might I highly recommend their lemon drop martini as well? It packs a Lalah Ali punch! Inevitably, there's really no going wrong here. I reside just down the way and I'm in sheer Heaven. Oh and they even permit you bringing your own bottle of wine. ANOTHER plusss! Most places frown upon this yet while Bottega charges a feasible cork-pop fee, they still allow it and will even go so far as to place your bottle over ice and/or serve your beverage to you in a carafe. FYI: They don't do reservations. In turn, add your name to their waiting list upon entering and hit up the bar!

Ok, Idk what all the hype is about....... (This is my review for the service, ambiance, location & macarons) Ordered: - 7 macarons in flavors of 1. Rose 2. Espresso 3. Strawberry 4. Violet cassis 5. Grand Cru 6. Passion 7. Chocolate Orange This place is wayyyyyyy too hyped up with their macarons. I guess since I'm not a big dessert fan that this is why I'm not loving the place. Likes - The restaurant itself is beautiful and classy looking. (Sort of hard to spot because the name of the store is branded in very light beige color that you would miss it if you didn't look closely. Or you can just spot the large amount of people outside & inside haha) - The decor and placement of the dessert made every one of them look so tasty and fabulous Dislikes: - The service of the cashier. He wasn't pleasant at all & looked like he wasn't paying attention to what i was saying. BIG "X" for him! - However, the other guy that was giving us the macarons was so sweet & nice! He helped us pick out flavors and was very friendly - THE MACARONS WERE NOT THAT GREAT !!! And for $2 each?!?!? Omg. I might as well have just threw my money down the gutter.... -__- it wasn't anything special. I've had macarons at other places and they all just taste whatever to me. - Parking...... no  street parking so had to pay $4 for get these damn macarons lol Bottom line, I'll only come back here for food because I've heard great reviews about them. But I would never spend $$$ on macarons again! NO THANKS!

First of all the address shown on yelp is incorrect! Its on the corner of 7th & Grand. This is such a beautiful space with great food, drinks, and desserts! I had never been here before when I walked in it was so crowd and I thought there was going to be a super long wait but it was just about a 10-15 min wait for two. Had a very friendly waiter that told us the pizza was a great choice so that is want we got and boy was he right! it was delicious. Also ordered the the calamari which tasted fresh and yummy.

I walked into Louie blindly. I had never heard of it. Never eaten food there or from there. The clever pastel gift bag (reminiscent of Tiffany's blue) was a cherry on top. I had a few hours to myself and goofed off in Downtown LA where I rode the Angel's Flight, saw the statue of the Ernst & Young worker with it's head lodged into the building, ate at the Taco House, and enjoyed the view of the part of LA that was obviously 'hopping' in the 20's. While on my way back to my hotel I notice a large glass wall and inside were a lot of people eating and they looked really happy. I was hungry and decided to be happy myself.  I filtering my way through the crowded doorway and hostess onslaught I immediately was coaxed by the dessert counter and floated directly to it like Aladdin on a magic carpet. Like the fish that got away, the counter had to be 200' long and delicious amuse bouches were stacked 12 tiers high. Not really but it sure seemed like it. I stood there in a droned trance and watched a gentlemen build a fruit tart. No attitude, no muss, no fuss. He wielded his weapons and like a magician waving his hand over a crystal ball POOF a perfectly crafted tiny sweet tart strategically piled with fresh fruit. Every bite was an eye closing experience (minus audible moans). Already full of actual lunch I left Bottega Louie with 5 different treats and about $20 less in the pocket and no regrets. I was super stoked to share these heavenly little morsels with other mere humans like myself.....or did I. MUHAHAHAHAHAHA! But really if you have a chance to stop by you will be charmed and enchanted. It's fun being a big kid in a big kid candy store.

Loud busy candlelit restaurant. Good for friends but hard to hear your date if you are trying to have a romantic dinner. Food is so-so.  Steamed salmon is neat in a packet but very light tasting. Portobello mushroom fries are only good when HOT. Tomato burrata too salty.  However, I enjoyed the onion soup and LOVEd the chocolate soufflé.  The macarons are also good. ***Go for small bites and order the awesome souffle!!!!

Heard from friends that desserts were great, but came here for weekend brunch around 10:30AM.  It was pretty crowded, but surprisingly, there was no wait and we were seated right away.  Because of the tall ceilings, it was pretty noisy too that it was difficult to converse.  Better to come in groups than for an intimate meal.  Also the A/C was blasting so I was freezing.   The brunch menu was pretty extensive.  Sitting next to the pizza oven, pizza sounded good, but it was a little too early in the day to eat one so I ordered the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes with a side of bacon instead.  My husband ordered the Belgian Waffles with a side of roasted potatoes.  After ordering, it took forever to get our coffees since our server was so damn slow.  I get cranky when I don't get my morning coffee! When we got our food, we were astonished how big the portions were.  4 big pancakes and 2 big waffles!  LA people must eat a lot!  If we had known, we would have just gotten either the pancakes or waffles and got something else.  They tasted good, but it wasn't anything great.  I was still distraught by the portion size that it was difficult to enjoy my food.  Only ate 1.5  of the pancakes.  Bacon and potatoes were not hot.  It seemed like it was sitting out for awhile so that was disappointing too.  When we were ready for our coffee refills and to get our check, our server was not attentive so we kept having to search for her and flag her down. Overall, okay food, slow service, noisy and cold environment = not so great experience.  Should have listened to friends and just got dessert.  Too bad there was no room for dessert.

Holy crap this place is amazing. The food, the ambience, the BAKERY? Can't get any better than this. I came here with a friend and we shared a Lamp Chop, the Portobello Fries, and Arugula salad. We finished with a chocolate souffle and the lovely macarons we saw when we came in. The Portobello Fries really are delicious and the dipping sauce it comes with (I think it was a basil spread) goes so well with the flavor. The Lamb Chop was ridiculously flavorful and so well cooked--the kind that falls off the bone. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. But I think the best part about our meal was the Chocolate Souffle. Our waitress asked us early if we wanted to order it since it takes 20 minutes to make, but good Lord it was so worth it. Warm, moist, and not too sweet. It was like eating ice cream out of a steaming ramekin. The macarons were delicious too, especially the violet colored one because I wanted to try something new. There are multiple colors and flavors of macarons available and they all looked amazing! Overall good experience. Definitely wouldn't be coming very often though because it's such a nice place and well into the two dollar sign range. I think the bill came out to about $73 total, which actually isn't bad when I think about the food we ate. This place is more quality over quantity!

I discovered my favorite pasta here. TRENNE IS A MUST!! Delicious combination of crunchy pasta with savory beef stew. I'm drooling right now. We also ordered the octopus as an appetizer and if you eat sushi you'll know it just taste like tako with roe.  The clam linguine was also light and yummy. The other pasta I had was not so memorable. We ended up ordering 3 creme brulees because a friend told us it was good. Tastebuds do not lie. BEST CREME BRULEE EVER! It is also a plus that you can go and order some macaroons to take home after your meal. I recommend the green tea!

The Sunday brunch here was pretty good. I would recommend the pancetta scramble and potato pancakes. The Lobster hash was a little fishy. The beignets were not pipin hot. Other than that the service and atmosphere was great. Good people watching since we had a nice corner table away from the hustle and bustle as this place is extremely crowded and busy. I was surprised we got a table right away. After brunch I ordered some of their pastries. Their cranberry lemon scones and chocolate croissants are delicious. The croissant was flaky and chewy, just like a good croissant should be. The chocolate eclairs were ok, but the passion fruit tart was pretty good. I would come here again and try their french macaroons.

I bestow upon Bottega Louie the highest praise an Angeleno can give: it' s worth driving from the Westside in the rain to eat here! What a fun place.  The building is gorgeous, and the staff is hip and cool but helpful and friendly.  And the food - wow!  Best bolognese I've had in ages.  The duck prosciutto, the chocolate souffle, the pizza - all terrific. Even the bread is great.  The menu is varied so it's affordable for everyone (the bolognese was $14), or you can get more spendy with short ribs or seafood dishes.   The only reason I'm giving this four stars instead of five is the noise level.  VERY loud.  I was able to hear my dining companions, but it was a stretch.  Also, make a reservation, though the bar is fun to bide your time in.

Seriously, watch the look on your girl's face when she enters and gets her first glance at the desserts behind the counter, I can't even pronounce half of them.

I was excited to go for all the hype I heard about this place.I am a real foodie and eat out 6 days a week.I have to say the service is top notch and the food does come out quite quickly considering how bustling/busy it is.The food for the most part has a gorgeous presentation. We had a myriad of dishes, from a pizza, salads, pasta with clams, steamed vegetables, dessert ,wine and coffee.The pasta was not up to par for my taste, It was dry and lack-luster of real flavor.The pizza was truly tasty but again a little dry, The roof of my mouth still hurts.So I will give it 3 stars for the food itself.I am giving it 2 stars for the overall experience.Parking is a quite brutal. It is somewhat loud. The menu writing is too small when you are trying to read it at night.It has very low light. The pace is that of an eatery and less of any dining experience especially with price factor one is paying. Everything is a la carte. So when you add up each dish; it can really add up . The desserts I would say are their real strong suit. Overall not my kind of place. Downtown has a lot more to offer for great food and dining.

Love this place, great drinks and food. And the scene is cool too, beautiful old building cleaned up to look how it might have in its hay day. Sausage pizza ordered and thin and crispy and is just perfect. The arugula salad with shaved Parmigian is also incredible. Pastas aren't my favorite things on the menu but there's plenty that's great to keep me coming back. Oh yes, the desserts are great too. One more thing, the quality of service is excellent and something you'd expect from a much more expensive spot.

I feel like this place waay over hyped. The food was good but not for the price. I came in with my friends for dinner and I ordered pizza and it was $20! Two of my friends ordered soups and each one cost $8. I should have expected for this place to be over priced but usually I don't mind paying if the food is amazing. I give it three stars for the service. Our server was nice and kept refilling our waters. Even though she knew we were students, she still treated us well unlike most bougie places, they treat you like crap. I also bought a beignet on the way out for a $1.50. Nothing special, just a sugar donut filled with nuttella inside.

It may be a little unfair for me to submit this review, but I'm doing it anyways because I don't believe the full picture of Bottega Louie is being represented in many of these reviews. First of all, Bottega Louie is very hip. Indeed, it's obviously *the* place to be in downtown Los Angeles. Trendy, without a doubt. Girls in revealing tight dresses and douchebags making asses out of themselves pretty much characterizes the majority demographic of its customer base. I have very little tolerance for douchebaggery these days; therefore, as soon as we walked through the doors and saw the sickening parade of these individuals engrossed in what they do (being idiots), I was immediately turned off. Granted, Bottega Louie cannot control who frequents their establishment. Nevertheless, it can control the atmosphere and flow of its operation, both of which I found to be irritating and offensive. Without exaggeration, the space is a sea of wall-to-wall people. We arrived for dinner and didn't know what to do; there was no hostess at the front, no signage, and no employees showing any regard for those of us that were standing there in our bewildered state. Finally, we flagged down a waiter and he directed us over to the middle of the restaurant where a very long line existed. Yes, the hostess stand is situated in the middle of the restaurant. That makes perfect sense (rolling eyes).  We waited in line for about 15-20 minutes just to get to the hostess to put our name on the waiting list. While waiting in line, people were walking in between us, bumping us. Sheer chaos! To make matters worse, the noise level was terribly obnoxious and out of control. How anyone could hold a conversation at a table without shouting would be a miraculous feat. As we waited and waited, the noise became so bad that I could sense a headache forming in the back of my head. At that point, we agreed to leave and find another restaurant that was more welcoming and quiet. Judging by the scores of reviews, I'm sure their food and treats are very good. Until something changes regarding their overall operation, however, I won't be returning. Not my style.

Pros: - Modern, nice decor. Love the high ceiling, open space. - Food is good especially the pastas and dessert. - Good service. Cons: - They don't take reservations. First come first serve so tough if you come with a large group as they usually make you wait longer. - Not a baby friendly place. - Too noisy. My friend was sitting across from me and I couldn't hear her. We were literally 'shouting' at each other the whole time.

It's located in Downtown LA and the foods are great here! I really like the Portobello Fries, pizzas, and the macrons. As most people say on this review, definitely get the Portobello Fries as your appetizer! There's a reason for that. There are few negatives at this place though.. 1. Parking 2. Noise You have to find your own street parking or part at a $5 parking garage. I don't highly recommend to come here as a date since the place gets really loud so you can't really have a comfortable conversation at dinner time.

It's loud, cramped, and hard to get seated.. Well, let's try this place! If there's a lot of people in a restaurant, must be pretty good right? Well, it's pretty good, not great, but eclectic though. Seating here is on a first come bases in all cases. Best to get a window view here though it does get kinda weird when people from outside stare at you. I've been lucky a few times and not so much other times to go somewhere else. I've had their pastas and pizzas here. The Trenne pasta and short ribs are my favorite dishes. They serve drinks here perfectly. Black Label with a two inch cube which is perfect since the ice doesn't water down the drinks so much. The  bakery which is next to the bar area is very artsy with trees of macarons and lots of desserts and candies. When I'm in the area, I'm always intrigued to go inside and check things out. Reminds me of a Dean & Deluca from NYC without the market.

Wow...! That's the first thing I said when I walked in. This place is a really awesome place for LA. Great atmosphere and ambiance.  The decor is really nice and trendy. The staff is prime and deserve to applauded to because they serve it up. The waiting area/cafe area is a nice touch to the busy restaurant side. The food was excellent. I have no complaints except one; my pizza was overcooked/crispy just a touch. Definitely a place to tell your friend. Recommended! Pros: Staff, Food Cons: Waiting Stars: 5 PS. Well executed place.

The desserts are absolutely delicious! Very inexpensive for the quality in my opinion. The restaurant isn't too fancy but very cute and the service is great. The portobello fries are to die for! The portions are a little small for the price BUT the quality of food is great! It's definitely a must-try if you're in the area.

Overpriced - Overhyped - Overcrowded.    vs. Fantastic Food + Superb Service + Magical Macarons. At Bottega Louie, the food, service, pastries win. So do you ... if you go. My recommendations: * Parking is $5 and up at the lot on Grand between 7th & 8th. * Try a flavorful Pizza like Mushroom, Bianco, or Burrata * Pasta Choice: Trenne (sauteed with Rib Eye) or Clam Linguine * Don't be shy about asking for the fresh Bread and cold Butter * Small Plates: Portobello Fries, Lamb Porterhouse, or Burrata & Vine Tomatoes * Seriously, get the Portobello Fries if you love mushrooms or morels. * Have a glass of wine or share a bottle to round out the mood. * Save room for the famous Chocolate Souffle (20 min. so tell your server early) * Get 5 Macarons for $10 in a cute box to go. They are amazing. Ok, get a bigger box. * Beignets are hard to pass up... so don't: Raspberry, Chocolate-Hazelnut, or Regular * It's busy. Coming during peak hours will not  fun. Check-in & wait. No reservations. * This is not a quiet romantic restaurant. It's a loud (really loud) and popular one. The almost 5000 reviews and 4 star rating for Bottega Louie are telling you the same thing this review is ...             Go            Wait           Relax         Dine Well        Drink Well     Enjoy Dessert Macarons & Beignets

After hearing all the hype I was so excited to have lunch here. While a bit on the loud side, the space is absolutely gorgeous. I took my mom here once for macaroons and she felt like she had been transported to an eatery in France. The food is underwhelming. Most of the dishes including the caprese salad, portobello fries, and pasta lacked an bold flavors. The cocktails were good, but were not able to rescue the rest of the meal. The highlight of the visit was the macaroons. The are exquisit and come in an assortment of flavors including earl grey, espresso, green tea, and rose. Bottom-line: Skip the meal and go straight to the macaroon counter.

A great spot for breakfast/lunch/brunch. There are a ton of beer and cocktails, iced tea/lemonade, and juice choices. I just want them all. Ended up trying the eggs benedict and the ravioli for brunch. The portion sizes are fairly small, but the food is packed with flavor. The ravioli is delicious and I wish there were just more of it. The eggs benedict was solid. You gotta try the macarons. There are a ton of choices and they are filled with great combinations of various flavors. The strawberry and lemon are especially appealing and the salted caramel is also good if you are not looking for a fruit flavored macaron.

That feeling when you can finally try a restaurant you've bookmarked for months! :D Only downfall: WAIT TIME. Being a popular and consistently busy restaurant, I wish Bottega Louie offered a reservation option even if it's just to hold a table for the next 30 minutes. Decor: White walls, high ceilings, and clean cut. Typical for downtown. Open kitchen which can help kill the wait time. Ambiance: Vibrant. Expect to talk over each other.. Service: Exceptional servers though I can't really say the same for the hostesses. It might be because they're constantly being bombarded with people trying to get seated but that doesn't mean to disregard their priorities. Hostesses set the tone for our eating experiences so don't drop that smile.   Food: -Portobello fries: delish! -Lobster hash: had to consciously remind myself to slow down. The poached egg really tied everything together. And of course, had to pick up macarons before walking out the door!

You can't hear the person if front of you since the room echoes like a cave. Also, parking sucks. You will always need $6 to park in the lot behind the restaurant.

I have honestly no idea why this place gets such a high rating! I honestly think it's just the bakery that attracts all the people. So after my Rock n Roll Half Marathon, my awesome bf took me here....however after running 13.1 miles - the pastries, macaroons, and other sweets that were beautifully displayed did not appeal to me at all...and that's pretty unusual. I usually would try out the dessert however perhaps because I was super tired that I didn't really want such heavy and sugary foods. The one thing about this place I could understand that people would ultimately love besides the sweets is the service....excellent - I would say for a restaurant that's not super expensive. The hosts and waiters would refer to you as Mr. or Mrs. - very formal and certainly makes diners feel important and special. The service is indeed excellent. The food, however, was very typical. Of course the display of the food is attractive and appealing but honestly (and perhaps this is only because it's brunch, I'm not speaking of their regular dinner or lunch menu) was very typical. I had the Smoked Salmon Benedict...given that this dish is usually made with ham and biscuit with Hollandaise sauce, I do like their version of it much better - it was made with two potato pancake topped with smoked salmon, sautéed greens, red onions, poached eggs, creme de fraiche and Hollandaise sauce. My bf ordered their Pancetta scramble and a side of their roasted potatoes...it was okay - rather kind of plain actually. First impression of this place as I walked by - wow people dress very nice! then I went in and realized not everyone - as a matter of fact this is one restaurant that I have ever seen with such a mixed crowd. - you have all sorts of people here - nicely dress, causally dressed, even not so good dressed at all...heh but it's one "fancy" restaurant that truly has many different customers. This place has very simple yet gorgeous decor...high ceiling, white marble and gold trim adds to the fanciness of this place...kind of reminds me something from Caesar Place in Las Vegas. Anyhow this is a really nice place considering it's located in the ghetto ares of downtown LA and service is great but the food was just okay to me, it wasn't as impressive as I thought it would be.

I am a frequent here, but itwas only this time i got the chance to finally rev up this wonderful place with a very honest review from your truly! What bad can i say about this place? Nada! Zip! None! How about what good can i say? Limitless things! I first want to say that i am in love thelocation and the post modern architecture that it has! I love the full glass windows that overlooks the pedestrian that criss cross between 7th and Wilshire and also the grit and dirt that makes downtown even more appealing--- and did i mention the airy high ceiling with wonderfully carved sconces. The ambience is cozy, comfy, casual, and the diners are a mix of everyone, which what makes LA, LA! The service was impecable! The waiters and waitresses are very professional yet comfortably disarming. I had stuffed portobello mushroom, salad, and pork chopwhich was out of this world good. The food was worth the price (which was actually cheap). I do not have to talk about it. It doesnt stop there, once you walk out, a treat awaits you on your way with full array of pastries and those little devils, the macaroons! Uhhmmmmmmmm yummy. After a  great dining it would just not be complete without a walk around downtown with friends with a cup of joe and enjoying the city in its rennaisance. Me and my friends always enjoy and always have a wonderful time every time we come to this downtown gem....and it makes me feel Cosmopolitan as an Angeleno dining here. Deinitely going to be a checklist to take friends who are not from the city.

After reading all of the reviews for their food, I'm instantly regretting not trying something because I headed straight to the bakery for their macarons instead. Their presentation and display makes everything too way to pretty to eat! I would call Bottega Louie the "Laduree of the West Coast" because their macarons are on the same caliber as Laduree and Pierre Herme. They have a great selection of flavors besides the typical ones, (strawberry, vanilla, raspberry, lemon) such as: matcha, earl grey tea, passionfruit, salted caramel, pistachio, rose, and a few more. What I love about Bottega Louie is that they give you a complimentary box with your macarons. (you can purchase them in increments of 5 and 12) At Laduree, you have to pay for your box, (if you don't get a box, they just stuff all of your macarons in a paper bag) AND they even offer to wrap it in a ribbon for you! If you're visiting LA and have a love for macarons and desserts in general, Bottega Louie should definitely be on your to-do list.

First of all, although it is said that this place is liked by vegetarians, I don't think there were a ton of vegetarian options. Where's the pasta al pesto, or pasta all'arrabiata, or ravioli di zucca / funghi porcini / spinaci&ricotta? (to name but a few..) Second, is this place supposed to serve Italian or French food? The classification suggests Italian, and does part of the menu, but then 'fleur de sel' and Macarons are obviously French.. The food; I opted for a pizza, split between two kinds - I liked that there was the option to do so. However, I wasn't impressed by the pizza. The Bianco was too bland, could hardly taste the mozzarella and parmezan. The Napoli was spicier than expected, which was ok, but it was too salty.   The pizza bread/bottom is also not much to write home about. Dessert;  the pear tart was fine, bit difficult to cut, nice flavour, although the pear taste wasn't very strong. A side note to this review; I lived in Italy for a couple of years, so it is hard to impress me with Italian food. I felt the food I had here was below Italian standard. Regarding atmosphere; it was very noisy in the restaurant. I could hardly here what the person opposite me (round table) was saying. I think if the restaurant was to put up some curtains or something to improve the acoustics, it would be better.

My review is strictly on the macarons that I've tried.  This place is very cute.  It has a bunch of desserts behind display glass, cute little tables next to the bar, a lot of chocolate covered this and chocolate covered that.  I love it.  The line gets long so be prepared.  Also, I suggest writing down the flavors you see and want so you don't hold up the line too much.  Some of the flavors I got were pistachio, vanilla, rasp chocolate, etc.  The texture was excellent.  I've eaten a lot of macarons and not that I'm an expert, but I know what I like.  The texture and flavor of the macarons were delicious.  I had the pistachio and I would say that was my favorite.  The vanilla one, not as good but still okay.  Definitely gonna have to come back here to try more desserts!  Street parking in downtown area.

DO YOU WANT SOME MACARONS? WHAT? WAIT, WHAT? Yes, the conversations that take place at Bottega Louie will most likely be of you screaming to other people, but it'll be worth it. Oh how beautiful their bakery section is, honestly, the people are so used to being photographed, they must feel like zoo animals (but dressed and smells way better). The only downside is things add up and before you know it, you've spent $50 on fruit tarts, some macarons, and then some. Oh if only you could have a supermarket sweep of the place and just grab what you can at no cost... I'd have my arms filled with the most beautiful macarons that are rose and lavendar.

Soley for the french macaroons... BL wins it for having the prettiest bakery display ever. As evidenced by the hoards of fobby Asians with their SLRs taking pictures. They have a billion different flavors of macaroons and are all so brightly colored, almost makes it too pretty to eat. I said almost. I got 5 different flavors that I can't even recall what they were, but all very tasty. I think the biggest downside is the price - $2 per little macaroon. Where does all the price goes? - see above for fancy display and also the ridiculously nice box they put them in. I almost wanted to save mine to put nick-nacks and jewelry in. Overall, certainly the best macaroons downtown. But if you find yourself on the Westside, Bouchon bakery is a better deal with only $3.50 for a large macaroon (think 3-4x the size of BL's).

Aesthetics wise... this is like a candy-land for us girlies. Why lie...I saw men here, either in groups or dining solo, enjoying the ambiance. The place gets packed...and I mean packed!!! Came here with five other folks; we luckily beat the dinner crowd because we got seated in 1/2 hour...not bad. Once we were seated, our server (sorry I forgot your name!) was on the game from beginning to the end. Mind, you, we literally dined for 2.5 hours and the wait staff was amazing, filling waters and booze without us EVER asking! I do have to say...whichever pizza we ordered, and there was three...they don't scrimp on the garlic! You'll feel like you left the Gilroy Garlic Festival from all the garlic you ate from the pizzas. The entrees we ordered was kid portions at adult adult prices! Don't get me wrong...their lamb steak and pastas were delish...but yikes, for normal appetites, you'll have to order two portions of an entree to equal a remote dinner. Luckily, we tried everything family style so no one was starved. In short: Burrata pizza: good! Claim Linguinie: good, but tiny portion Lamb porterhouse steak: good, but again, tiny portion Portabello frieds: shit, why lie: you'll have to order a few of these because no one will have just one Bruschetta: typical, but lots of garlic piled on Desserts...ooo.... Chocolate souffle: well worth the wait and ordering! Beignets: delish...and accompany it w/ raspberry sauce and you will thank me. Macaroons: we ordered 10 different flavors...none of them sucked! So why just 4 stars after the gluttony: meh...just overpriced, overcrowded spot...but  it's a bustling place to catch up with rowdy friends among other rowdy patrons and to enjoy the downtown LA nightlife without being scared.

Ok, am I like the only one who was SUPER impressed with how pretty the bathroom was? Seriously guys... the bathroom has got to be one of the prettiest restaurant bathrooms I've ever seen. Anyway, moving on to what most people probably come to yelp for... reviews of the FOOD. The boyfriend brought me here on our first date for Sunday brunch(hehe hoho, so cute.) Anyway, the wait was RIDICULOUS. Good thing we're both 21+ and the bar was right there! He got a mimosa and I got a bellini. The bellini is SOO good! Must try that if you can. Once we were seated, I ordered a smoked salmon benedict & he got the lobster hash. The salmon was a bit too salty for me, but I LOVED the lobster hash (yes, he ordered it, but it might as well be mine then right?) After, we got a few macaroons. He loved the raspberry chocolate.. I recommend pistachio & earl grey. In any case, it's a pretty, cutesy place to come with your girls, your girlfriend, your boyfriend or your mom. :]

Young, sophisticated yet casual atmosphere. The food was good but nothing memorable unfortunately. For not being a fan of mushrooms, I did enjoy the portobello fries. And of course, I couldn't leave without trying their Vanilla & Almond gelato which had a very nice creamy and smooth consistency but wasn't overpowered by the almond or vanilla flavor. A bit on the pricey side, but we did have a very friendly and timely service which can be hard to get nowadays. Not a place I'd go to on a regular basis, but I would recommend to someone looking for a classy yet casual place to dine that's not completely out of budget.

As if they needed another raving review...here goes: This place is overwhelming enormous, but this feeling subsides as soon as you settle into your table laden with portabello fries and delicious (and strangely shaped) bread. Our table was near the pizza kitchen, which is a mesmerizing place to sit. Those pizza chefs work with such grace and precision. It's truly delightful to watch as they construct delicious pies of delicate ingredients like rapini, burrata, and garlic. Every now and then they surprise you with a 10 foot dough toss which explains why this restaurant needs to occupy such a grand space. The staff is courteous and knowledgeable. Our waitress gave us great recommendations for our large party and even gave us the *genius* idea of pre-ordering our dessert. The majority of our table ordered generous portions of pizza. I ordered the Chicken Carciofi, which is a delectable and simple dish of artichoke hearts, capers, garlic, and herbs finished with an olive oil and white wine sauce. The chicken was so tender and was complimented well by the other ingredients. My boyfriend ordered the Ceppo Gamber, which features homemade tube pasta, shrimp, vegetables, olive oil broth, and fleur de sel (which was amazing). Both dishes were light but extremely flavorful. I was happy to try bites of the pizza but was most satisfied with the entrees we ordered. Our pre-ordered chocolate souffle (a must) arrived soon after our plates had been cleared. Our waiter ceremoniously prepared the souffle with a swift pour of the cream sauce into the fluffy chocolate cake. We were a table of mostly dessert lovers so this item was devoured in minutes. We spent the rest of the evening enjoying the constant buzz of chatter, clanking silverware, and general bustle of the restaurant. A trip to the patisserie for some take-home macaroons concluded our evening. Dining at Bottega Louie is an experience, not just a meal. I look forward to introducing this restaurant to out-of-town guests as it represents LA so well: the best of the best.

Portobello fries are good, but overly rich. Once I ate half the portion, I felt satiated. Once I finished the portion (with the help of a friend who had 3 fries total), I felt slightly nauseous. Certainly when a hundred-dollar 10-foot cone covered in multicolor macarons looms from a polished window, you can't help buying macarons. They're available in the entire spectrum, and more. Most of the desserts staring up at you superciliously from behind their glass display feature gold flakes. (Few things in life rival the pretentiousness of eating gold: considering your thrifted clothes "vintage," eating organic, discussing things more pretentious than eating gold...) The first and last time I came here was to try this place before leaving for the good old South. If I come here again, I'd better have a damn compelling occasion (e.g. winning the lottery).

I've been to Bottega Louie numerous times and I really love the atmosphere, great spot for downtown LA.  It gets super busy, but it has a great bakery and a great bar.   The place is super loud and you might have to wait 30-40+ min for a table.  Honestly I would have given this place a 4 star review, but I was here yesterday with a date and everything was going amazing until I found a piece of hair in the pizza. This has never happened to me and I don't know if it was my date's hair or it was from the kitchen, but the piece of hair was literally between the cheese and the crust.  It really grossed me out and lost all my appetite.  I honestly don't think I can go back to this spot any more. I told the waiter and he took the dish back, but at that point I didn't want another pizza, so I just ordered some pastries, cause I was starving.  The waiter was really nice and apologized numerous times, but honestly a piece of hair in the food needs the managers attention.  I expected the manager to come by and apologize.   I think this was a fluke experience, but the fact that the manager didn't come by and I had to wait 30 minutes for a pizza and then another 15 minutes for a pastry and then pay $110 for the bill was just g-d awful.

Regardless of how packed it is, I can definitely say that their sweets are worth it.  Things I can recommend:  Lemon Tart, Raspberry Stuffed Pastry, and Macarons.  Everything is made right there and has a very gourmet look and taste to it.  Not only do their sweets taste fantastic, they look fantastic.  They really have the textures of their pastries down, whether is the perfect crust on the lemon tarts or the soft shell of their macaroons.  You'll often find yourself buying some to go to give to people as gifts.   PROTIP:  Typical tourist hype.  Not sure if it is worth the wait and clusterfuck for dinner, but definitely swing by their open area to pick up deserts.

Great atmosphere, very NY. I've dined there only once and the food was good but I like the deserts the best. The cappuccino is also one of the better ones in town. Food: 7/10 Desert: 9/10 Service: 9/10

This place is great! Just the entire set up - the way the place looks and feels is great. Their customer service is amazing. I swear that our server looked like Superman! Besides that, the servers definitely know the menu because they were able to quickly and confidently advise us when the were unsure on what to get. We got an assortment of different plates including salad, bruchetta, and pasta. Even the water tasted so refreshing. Anyone who comes here must have the macaroons. They are delicious! One more thing, it can get pretty loud in here so just be careful, probably won't be able to have an intimate date here. =)

Love their portabella fries with basil aioli sauce yummm! Their pizzas are really good. Great size to share between a few people. I tried their white one (I think it has clams on it? I forget)... Their veggie one was pretty good, the one that had artichokes in it. Not heavy at all considering it's a pizza. Their tripenne pasta is good except the pasta is normally served fried. I didn't like it fried because it was too chewy for a pasta, so I asked them for non-fried, and it was much better. It's basically like pasta in beef stew with kale. So good. Their candy is really good too! Love their grapefruit candy and their peach gummy candy.

I have been here multiple times and generally the food has been great (4 stars). However the last dinner was a disappointment! 1. We ordered our usual pizza which was overcooked. 2. Waiter recommended the ceppo pasta with shrimp - very disappointing. 3. Hanger steak was dry. 4. Minestrone was salty and oily. 5. Souffle was the best part of the meal.

Bottega Louie- I love u! So delish. Set in an architecturally beautiful building, this restaurant is first class. The pizza is to die for and the short ribs are out of this world. They have a full bar and incredible maccaroons. My personal favorite is the salted caramel one.

We really loved this place.  Great service, beautiful people and delicious food.   The pan seared trenne pasta was one of the most amazing pasta dishes I've ever had...and I've eaten my way through Tuscany twice.  A little crunchier than al denta the only downside to this dish was the potion size, I could have eaten much more!  (but I'm not from LA.)  Reasonable prices too.  Would love to return.

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful place. Like being in San Francisco, NYC and Paris at once, all smushed together in one large and beautiful high-ceilinged room. I'm thrilled to know such a place exists in LA. We drank a delectable 2008 Sonoma red recommended by the bartender while we perched waiting for a table on Saturday night. Nobody in our party minded the wait: we were off to the side next to the small bar and the people-watching was just exquisite. I'm pretty sure I glimpsed at least one A-lister. Once we were seated, we continued with the lovely wine (and a delicious fresh OJ for the DD) to accompany some of the oft-mentioned portobello fries. Their brilliance is difficult to adequately describe... I'll just stick with "mmmmmmmmm." After some thought, we split one onion soup and one salad as appetizers, so as not to use up valuable room for the legendary dessert offerings. The soup was perfectly-sized and was just the right thing to share as a bite-on. It turned out to be a good thing we ordered the starters, for our main course ended up being delayed for some time in the kitchen. Actually, I didn't even notice it was so late: we were having such a blast chatting and sipping at our table that it didn't cross my mind until our considerate and accomplished waiter came over to apologize. Wen it arrived, everybody was thrilled with what they'd ordered. I had the trenne, and hubby had the linguine with seafood. However, the winner of the best plate of the night had to be the chicken carciofi, which our friend let us try. Out of this world!!! Desserts have already been beautifully described by other Yelpers: soufflé - fabulous; le grand macaron - delicious cross between sweet and tart, chewy and gooey, fruity and sugary. I expected our bill to be higher than it was, too. Not bad for an entire evening of delightful experiences with great friends. Oh, and don't pay any attention to the comments about noise. You can see from the moment you glance in the window that this is a highly popular downtown eatery: were you expected hushed tones and whispering waiters when the line to get a table is out the door for 2 hours straight? Come with people you don't mind talking loudly for, gaze around you and savor the myriad of treats that is Bottega Louie. Worth every penny.

This is a great place to come for dessert and to people watch! Of all the different places i've tried that supposedly "specialize" in macaroons, none compare to Bottega Louie! I am always so enticed to purchase every flavor as soon as i walk in the door. To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of the food here, but I'm without a doubt addicted to their macaroons! I would highly recommend taking any out of town guests here if they want to get a glimpse of the LA downtown scene.  I love the unique architecture of this place and love how it is always lively, loud, and filled with a diverse LA crowd!

Got the eggs benedict for brunch and it was.. meh! Had to rush out because had to catch the game at Staples but I would definitely come back here to check out their other food items and their bakery. I got a kick out of their maccaroon x'mas trees decor!

I FINALLY checked-in to the super hyped restaurant around the LA area. HAHAHA And I must say...it was below my expectations :( but I had a great time with great people. We ordered Panzanella salad($10): it had the vinaigrette dressing with cherry tomatoes, on the menu it said "ripened" tomatoes but ....I guess they forgot the "ripe" part but overall the salad was decent it was nothing that'll make me think about though. Portobello fries($10): THIS WAS GOOD, one of my friends actually DO NOT eat mushrooms but she gave this one a try and kind of liked it haha she didn't go for seconds but at least she ate one. The fries come with a sauce which was seriously THE BEST SAUCE EVER. Clam linguini($16): bland.... The clams were VERY seasoned but the linguini was .... bland there wasn't enough... the linguini itself was so bland but I guess the VERY VERY well seasoned clam should've balanced it out but ... sadly it did not. Fettucine Belmondo ($16): This once again was bland as well... I don't know maybe I was just expecting too much from bottega, the pastas were not well seasoned. The parmeasan and once again their "unripe" tomatoes cover for their bland pastas. And we ordered a bottle of Riesling ($36): I'm not much of a wine person but riesling was very sweet and it was somewhat of a nice wine for me :) The service: on a thursday night it was VERY busy with a lot of servers, but we were NEVER too sure WHO our server was, a young lady did introduce herself to be our server but forgot to bring us water and ...disappeared. Some gentleman served us the wine but he never came back and another guy served us our food and took our order but never really checked up on us until we make the AWKWARD eye contact. I mean ... it was one of my VERY good friend's birthday and I guess I kind was expected them to be more attentive. But I must give them props for the very last server that came to our table and apologized for not bringing my sparkling water the WHOLE entire dinner, he said there was a problem with the sparkling water (prolly ran out of ...co2) hahah :) and thank you I honestly didn't want to make a big fuss about it but he apologized in advance. Lastly, we ordered the Le Grand Macaron ($9): for the birthday girl and the dessert was FREAKING AMAZING. The vanilla ice cream and the HUGE macaron piece made a wonderful combination. To be honest they did fail in so many ways this night but we had so much fun, it was our girls night out kind of night and I could've been a lot more b*tcher with the review but I know it was an off day! I still loved their dessert and their atmosphere so I'm going to give them another try VERY soon, maybe for their brunch :D

Chic, modern decor. 1/3 high scale candy bar, 1/3 bar, 1/3 restaurant. Seems like it wouldn't work but it actually gives the place a different uniqueness. I had the Ceppo Gamber and it was just the right amount of olive oil, veggies and shrimp. It was very filling as well. They get docked one star because their bread was harder and colder than you would expect. Will i go back? Most def!

Bottega Louie's got something special for everyone.  From carnivores to pescetarians, to vegetarian/vegans. They had me at the sit down with the complimentary premium sparkling water..hello!! Who does that? A friend & I came here on Good Friday (Christian observed holiday) and ordered the Modena salad, zucchini linguini, portobello fries, eggplant parmesan & salmon pasta and everything was insane good.  I wish I could have had more friends there to sample just about everything.  I was much impressed.  We ordered a chocolate souffle ahead of time for dessert and it was a delicious way to end our dinner. Now getting pass the bakery without buying something would be close to impossible considering you went through all that downtown traffic. A treat to go is in order, right? Our thoughts exactly! The french macarons here are quite pricey ($2 ea) for the size of a half dollar coin but man oh man, I think they were worth it!   The violet, rose, grand cru, pistachio flavors were smooth & innovative on top of out of this world.  In addition to the macarons, I took home some pana cotta, creme brûlée, eclair and tiramisu for my family and they loved it all.  Score! Thank you, Louie!

My first visit here was several years back and the experience was not memorable so I can't recall the food and service during our dinner experience. Although, this past weekend my friend had her birthday dinner nearby so we decided to drop by Bottega Louie for their delicious macarons. Once my eyes met the display case of macarons, my eyes lit up like a child on Christmas morning. My god the beautiful rainbow of macarons and the macaron tree displays! Gah! I fell in love instantly! Although I'm NOT in love with the price of these beauties. I heard they raised their prices so they are now $2 a piece! :( I still walked away with two 5 piece boxes. The boxes are so cute and they wrap them up nicely inside with tissue paper so they make great gifts! I was initially going to walk away with just one box but once I took a bite out of that delicious Earl's grey macaron I knew I didn't make the wrong choice. I would love to come back for more but I know it will end up costing me an arm and a leg in the long run if I start my macaron addiction now. Sigh...first world problems i know....

1star- loved the NY feel! + 1star- great service + 1star- great company made it worth it. The food is ok and for the price it should be better. Creative pairings, but the recommended Trenne pasta was an awful creative miss. Trenne translates to crunchy, veneer shattering "pasta". The portobello fries were dry and not seasoned well. Great idea, but very disappointing. The short rib and polenta was good. Again, the seasoning was bland on the short rib. The desserts are these macaroon multi colored cookies that all the women google over & clap at upon arrival. Bitches must be hungry & never experienced real, kosher Macaroons...these were just ridiculous hype. Again, I had the best company & service...or the 200$ bill would've really pissed me off. Lots of single women on the prowl here guys! ...even if they're hungry & trolling for blasphemous macaroons....its worth checking out or a drink!

Sunday morning. Brunchtime. Enter Bottega Louie. First time here, this place was packed at around noon.. beautiful décor, massive selection of pastries, friendly staff. I was looking around the restaurant and accidentally caught the eye of a few of the staff and they all smiled unlike most people in LA. Also great for people watching. I ordered the French toast, I love French toast, and was a tad bit disappointed. I don't love the farmy taste of eggs, and although I know French toast is dipped in an egg batter, I felt as though I was eating eggs on a farm in Wisconsin. But the toast was perfectly crunchy on the bottom and overall was ok. I would not order it again though. My boyfriend ordered the Lemon Ricotta pancakes, those were really tasty. He would order them again. Also said his coffee was bam. Gotta love a man who drinks his coffee black. We didn't save room for dessert but clearly planned on taking macaroons home. Note: We've never had macaroons! They were out of most of the ones we wanted but we ordered the strawberry, passion fruit, lemon, and vanilla. The vanilla and strawberry were especially good, but the passion fruit was kind of funny tasting. I couldn't decide what it was supposed to be. They come packed in a precious little box, it's darling. At $8 for four you definitely pay for that precious little box. The minus one star was for the server's attitude when we requested that we have the macaroons to go. Still can't wait to go back- Macaroons are my new favorite obsession. I hope they have the Earl Grey macaroon next time!!

This review is only on desserts. I tried the peanut butter terrine and the vanilla ice cream. I like my desserts with different textures, and it had both the softness and the crunchiness together. The ice cream is also very good, they actually make their own icecream. I definitely want to try the food here next time, but, to dine here there's always a long wait whenever I come, whether it's during lunch or dinner. So I would highly recommend making reservations. They have an open bar, many selections of desserts and pastries. Very classy, elegant, and hip. Also, they have to-go premade sandwiches and salads.

This place needs 2 separate sections for reviews.  The dessert section of the restaurant and the dining section. The dessert section gets hands down 5 stars.  The dining part gets a 3.  We waited an hour to be seated which was OK.  Ordered a glass of house wine which was nasty so i took it back and ordered something a little more napa if you know what i mean.  Waited for the table and got seated and right away received some warm fresh bread.   It was good. Not much flavor on it but fresh.  After going thru the very simple menu we decided to order the margarita pizza.  Came out and it was OK tasting.  Nothing to crazy for I'll be honest.  it was thin which i liked but it wasn't that tasty.  I was wondering if pizza was the wrong thing to order from this place.  But i wont know until i try it out next time.  Will go out back for sure.  Mostly for the sweets.  We ordered the macaroons.  All diff sorts and they were all amazing!

Love it!  First time was around 4:30 before ballet at Disney Concert Hall.  We had mussels, pizza, calamari, the fried mushroom and EVERYONE was so good.  Also the wait staff was super nice and good looking (single girl here) Glad we went a little early because the wait starting at 5:30 was crazy! Today I went back for a late breakfast and the restaurant took on a different personality.  It was brighter, crisp, and serene.  I got to really enjoy my french toast and latte. Good food, Good staff, Fair prices, Great Sweets!  Can't ask for anything more (maybe a loft upstairs)

Been to Bottega twice and they are not as good as they use to be. They need to do something about it or they will lose customers like me: Pizza: had the Artichoke and it was salty. We didn't finish the pizza but we tried by drinking lots of water because I hate to see wasted food. Portabello fries: yummy. These are special. Trenne: favorite dish! Lasagna: good but nothing spectacular. The bottom layer of my pasta was so hard we couldn't cut or chew it. Service: OK. Not great. Front desk text the wrong person that table was ready even though they had our right number. Not sure what the confusion was there. Good thing we went up to ask. Waited was 1 hr. As for our waitress, nothing special to talk about. Ask for pan epi bread with butter if you want it. They don't bring it out. Am I coming back? Hard to say. Probably not. I like the vibe but everything else was mediocre. I was hoping for better food and service especially because we bought guest. Parking: next door for $6

3.5 stars. This review is based on only one visit. I would come back, but I doubt I'd do so if it required waiting more than 10 minutes. Food is fairly priced, fairly tasty, and served in reasonable portions. Our party of 4 ordered several things and shared. The most memorable thing was probably the pizza, actually. The crust is very good. Ambience is magnificent and beautiful but loud, as echoed by countless reviews here. Service was friendly and good but nothing outstanding. Based on food alone, I'd say this is a solid 4-star place, but the puzzling popularity and the resulting wait times makes it closer to 3 stars for me.

I love this place because it's classy and beautiful and within walking distance of the Walt Disney Concert Center.   Also, their portobello mushroom fries are weird, but delicious. Seriously, a must try. They have excellent salads (only order as a starter, they're too small to serve as a entree). The kobe beef burger is quite tasty. Downside? It's insanely loud. Every interior surface is some kind of glass or marble, so every sound echoes across the room and magnifies.

3.5 Why, why do I keep coming back to BL?  Well, I work in downtown and decent food is limited.  The SERVICE HERE IS TERRIBLE.  In the restaurant, in the bistro, at the front desk, TERRIBLE.  The bakery people are super cool. The waiters are all walking around like they have nothing to do-meanwhile your glass is empty, your plate is sitting there and you have to set a fire drill to get another drink. I still dont get the guys in suits-walking around, looking busy, but the service is still horrific.   I even wrote to the GM after they first opened and it still bites.  I took my friend here that works for a very, very famous person-she was searching for a restaurant to host a party for this person and wow, I was embarrassed by the service. Almost everything I have eaten, however is solid.  You pretty much cannot go wrong with the food.  Hot, well seasoned, executed well and their desserts are the bomb.  anything in the dessert area with passion fruit is 5 stars.   OH and no matter what time you come, its super loud... your throat will sore after screaming to your dining mates after your meal.

Visited this place on a Monday night with a few friends. The place was surprisingly busy for 8:30pm Monday night... a good sign. We ordered the "Portobello Fries" and "Burrata & Roasted Vine Tomatoes" appetizers. I highly recommend the Burrata if you like cheese! The portobello mushroom could have used a lighter dough batter in my opinion, but the flavor and texture of the mushroom was good. For entrees, I ordered the Ceppo Gamber (jumbo shrimp pasta). The light wine sauce paired perfectly with the shrimp and ceppo pasta, along with broccollini and sun dried tomatoes. The butterflied shrimp was perfectly cooked and fresh, but the unattractive and unappetizing vein was still there. We also ordered the pork chop, and it did not disappoint! It was grilled rare (beware if you are afraid or rare pork), and had good subtle flavor and texture, and perfectly paired with apple sauce. Request it to be cooked to medium if you prefer, but I like the rare tenderness (if it's fresh, its okay to eat pork rare). The Lasagna was solid. The pasta layers were not too soft and had plenty of mozzarella cheese. Good downtown city atmosphere / ambiance. Noisy but comfortable.

I've been here several times and each time, have not been impressed with the food.  This place would get three stars if not for the excellent desserts.  Definitely would go back time and time again for the selection of creative sweets that are available, albeit expensive ones.   The food was only average, but this place will always be successful because of the beautiful venue and the desserts will suck you in time and time again.

Bottega Louie looks very nice. You walk in and the desserts display is amazing, and the ceilings are high and it feels pretty fancy, although attire is casual. The food and service however were just okay.  Our server was not very friendly, and very forgetful.   Portabello fries - These were just okay, did not like the batter. If you've had the ones at Pizza Antica, those are like 10x better. Prosciutto & Burrata with a potato cake - There was barely any burrata, but the proscuitto was good.  The potato cake was way too big, I'd much rather have more burrata. Lobster benedict - Good, but not great. French toast - Very disappointing. The slices are big and fluffy, but it was not very tasty.  Also, I was expecting mixed berry compote, but they just give you a few whole berries. It's a nice place to have brunch, and the macarons are good, but you can find much better food elsewhere.

Our group of five arrived at 6.30 in the evening, after parking in a garage across the street for a mere $4.  We were greeted warmly, and seated within moments of walking through the door.  BL does not take reservations, so we had been prepared to wait for a table.   When you walk in, you'll wander through the fairyland of a bakery that is located in the front of the restaurant.  It's so pretty, and everything looks so wonderful that you'll want to stop there and gawk.  Ok, go ahead, gawk a little, but keep your feet moving!  You'll get seated that much more quickly :) The first thing you notice after they seat you is that the noise level is almost rock concert worthy.  Seriously, it was so loud we nearly had to shout to each other to be heard at our intimate little round table. Anyway, we settled in and ordered our drinks - Arnold Palmer for me (pretty bland; I should have had a cocktail haha) and the vanilla Italian soda for Sister, and cocktails for the other ladies.  Our water glasses were quickly and constantly replenished with refreshing, filtered water throughout the evening. Butter and chewy, crusty bread arrive while you're looking over the menus, and we decided on the portobello mushroom fries and bruschetta for our starters.  I thoroughly reccommend both!  The fries were so good with the aioli they came with, and the tomatoes were super fresh and flavorful on the bruschetta. I'm a pretty big fan of linguini with clams, and though I really like a spicy red sauce, at BL, it comes in a white wine sauce.  Or so I thought.  When it arrived, I took my pictures and then began enthusiastically prying the clams from their shells with the cute little bitty fork provided, only to discover that they were overcooked into rubberiness, and there was no discernable taste of white wine.  A hint of lemon juice and butter to be sure, but it was hardly what I was expecting.  Still, I love pasta, especially linguine, so I du in, to discover cold linguine.  Not all of it was cold, but enough was.  I was hungry though, so I ate it.  Sister wanted me to send it back, but I just don't do that. Two of the ladies ordered and enjoyed the lasagna, which looked really yummy and man I wished I'd ordered that, or one of the pizzas the other two ladies ordered!  The pizzas were pretty generously sized, and looked good, I admit.  I'd like to come back here one of these days and try the pizza, as I suspect that they do this dish especially well :) We opted to go through the bakery area after paying our bill, to see what desserts we'd like to take home.  Macarons are a bit expensive here at $2 each, and not all of the flavors are superb, but the strawberry one was really delicious!  The ladies picked up various tarts and other confections, including fresh marshmallows, but we quickly concurred as a group that the desserts were much nicer to look at than actually eat. The service was not bad - certainly not great, but definitely within acceptable range.  Be prepared for the niose level and the proximity of other patrons though, as they sure do try to cram in as many tables and seats at those tables as they possibly can.

I dont understand the hype. We were staying at the JW and our pool boy suggested this place to us since it was close by. I dont know if it's because I'm from New York and we're used to things being a little over the top, but this place was boring and plain. Dont get me wrong, i love simplicity but this was a bit depressing. Super crowded and the wait was about an hour+. Had the Champs Elysee at the bar while we waited - soooo good. Ordered 2 more during dinner and had a fourth come to the table on the  house by accident (lack of communication between the server and the restaurant manager). Tried the Portobello Fries which i  found delicious - just wished there were enough aioli for the humongous fries. We shared the Burrata pie. I have to say no one got seconds. The rapini was so bitter and we just couldn't enjoy it. If i ever come back it would be for the Portobello fries and only if they have take out.

Bottega Louie was an okay meal, but it definitely wasn't worth the hassle. First of all, meters in the area are either $4 or $5 AN HOUR. WHAT? Your other option is to park at lots around the area that have a $6 flat rate. $6 to eat lunch for an hour and a half? that's nonsense to me. I can buy myself a burger, fries, and milkshake at in&out and still have change to spare. money doesn't grow on trees, you know. anyway, after begrudgingly paying for parking,  i met my friend at the restaurant. we only waited maybe 5 minutes on a Wednesday lunch at about 12:40pm before we were seated and greeted by a friendly waiter. we ordered the burrata pizza, portabello fries, and chocolate souffle. I wasn't really feeling the fries. Maybe it's because I had fried stuff the night before but it made me feel really sick and greasy inside. I could only eat a few pieces. The pizza, though decent in flavor, was a little too burnt and hard for my taste. By the end of the meal i could feel slabs of skin hanging off the roof of my mouth. i wasn't really feeling that. and i've definitely had better tasting pizza elsewhere. the chocolate souffle however, which takes 20 minutes to prepare, was great. It was delicate and rich, without being overly sweet, and it was fairly large. We also got macarons. My favorites were the matcha green tea, pistachio, and strawberry. I didn't like the salty caramel and the earl grey was just okay. friendly waiter went m.i.a. for the entirety of our meal except when he popped his head in to ask if we wanted dessert and to bring us the check. not so friendly anymore. portabello fries ($9) + burrata pizza ($20) + chocolate souffle ($15)  + macarons ($2 a piece) = a hefty price tag for lunch. Include the $6 we each paid for parking and the traffic we had to fight through to get there and back, and i would say a whopping IT ISN'T WORTH IT.

Something is terribly wrong...if not illegal here! Good food, good service but 20% tip added to the bill  then tax me on the tip, plus sales tax? Really? Seems excessive.  No wonder the waiter tries to get you to order dessert from the market/bakery at the table. Easily adds $50 of delicious marcoons  to your bill, plus the 20% tip,and gratuity tax, plus sales tax. Yikes :(  Although may be worth it to not have to deal with the chaos the bakery. Come with your black American Express.

Came here for dinner on a Saturday night (with an hour wait).  The hour went by fast because we spent a while walking around the area and then watching the cooks prepare the orders before we were seated.  Ordered the portabello mushroom fries (recommended by a friend), short rib, and salmon-- all of which I liked.  My favorite was the short rib--good texture, good flavor.  Ended the night off with a box of an assortment macarons to take home (a must if you're visiting bottega). Not a good place to be at if you're trynna have an intimate conversation.  I had a hard time hearing the waitress when we were first seated but luckily my bf and i aren't on a first date basis anymore and luckily we were seated next to the window so it wasn't AS loud as it was in the rest of the restaurant.  Don't think I'll be back again on a Saturday night just cos I was only willing to wait since it was my first time there.  Possibly next time for brunch with the girls!

Atmosphere - 4/5. I felt like I was back in NYC here. But it was also a douchey-feeling. Macaroons - 5/5 - Earl Grey and salted caramel were fantastic. The others we tried were good, not overly sweet. The box they use was extra nice quality too. Other Desserts- 6/5 - Hazelnut beignet. do it. DOO IT! Food - 3/5 - We were about to sit in the main restaurant, but the hostess annoyed me plus my other 2 friends were not here yet. We ended up in the bar area, which is what I'd probably recommend. Drinks were nothing special. We ordered a mushroom pizza and a bunch of small plates. I think the waiter forgot to put in the order for the pizza too, because he said "Oh you're pizza's on it's way out. And what pizza was it that you ordered?" Right. Smoooooth haha. Duck prosciutto crostini- Solid, but small portion. Meatball - dry/ burnt/overcooked. Lamb porterhouse - tasty, but cold Brussels Sprouts and pistachios - Actually pretty good. Portobello Fries - A MUST!. and the aioli is delish. And most of the food came out tepid-cold. 3 stars if it was just the food and I wouldn't come back. But the desserts were the saviour of the restaurant for me. Oh this was on a Friday night at around 11 PM as we just flew in and drove there straight from LAX.

Reasonably priced, exquisitely decorated, tasty food.  I think their macaroons are overrated.  But, you feel great at this establishment.  The service is similarly exceptional.

Brunch: the Farmer's Market Breakfast, which included fried potatoes, two eggs and tomatoes and something green. All fresh from a farmer's market, according to the waitress. It was good, but not great. Veggies were used more like a garnish than an actual ingredient. Eggs and potatoes were good, but the portion was fairly small, leaving me wishing that I'd ordered something else with it. Not really worth the $12. Also had beignets. They didn't use powdered sugar, which rendered it inferior to almost every other beignet I've had even though the dough itself was good. But, the raspberry compote they served with it was amazingly intense and delicious without being overly sweet. Dinner: Get pizza, its awesome. You can split one with someone else unless you're really hungry. Had some kind of mushroom pizza there last time. Very very good! Atmosphere: very nice marble architecture. But combined with high ceilings makes for an unnecessarily noisy environment. Service: Very friendly and attentive, though a tad slow. 4/5 for a great dinner and an okay brunch plus the generally good experience.

A lot of people have been raving about this place for a while so I decided to give it a try. The atmosphere is OK. It's extremely loud inside and I had difficulty hearing what my boyfriend was saying even though he was sitting right next to me. The service was on point, though. I can't complain about the food because it was excellent. I had the lasagna and may I say it was cooked to perfection. The portobello fries were a bit expensive but the flavor almost made up for it. All in all, this place has great food so stop by when you're around.

They need to accept reservations here!!! Ever since I moved to DT LA, I wanted to try this place! So I decided to come here for my birthday (4/20) and wing it on a Saturday night at 7PM. Smartest idea ever!!! No, not really. Long story short - I didn't get to eat here for my birthday =( The wait was almost two hours long! If you are planning to go to Bottega Louie, do not come here during prime time. I came back on a Sunday afternoon around 3-4PM when the lunch crowd died down and I was able to get a table at the bar area. I tried the salmon benedict and it was delicious! I'm not a big dessert fan but I also tried the tiramisu and crembrule. My favorites so far. The boxes are so pretty!

I lived downtown a few years back and went here all the time.  I guess I didn't yelp as much back then because I never gave Bottega Louie my 5-star rating.   With the frequency I've visited BL I believe this is one of my strongest 5-stars.  From their strong Italian menu including burgers, pizza, and appetizers to their fun bar, to the great atmosphere, to their fresh pastries. Bottega Louie provides a fun, energetic atmosphere that is perfect for date night, a business meeting, or a casual lunch.

This place has one of the best pizzas I've ever had!!! We came here mid-afternoon on a Sat after hiking up to the Hollywood sign and walking through the Griffith Observatory. I didn't know at to expect cuz my friend didn't set any expectations with me beforehand. When you first walk in, there is a 25-ft dessert case filled with individual tarts, pies, and cups of mousse. Oh my, what did I just walk into?!? The decor is beautiful and tastefully done with high ceilings, white walls, an leather booths. You feel like you just walked into an old Hollywood set. After being seated, and having a chance to look at the menu, we asked the waiter what he would recommend and he said pizza hands down! Wow, how do you say no that kind of recommendation? The menu is broken down into pizza, pasta, entrees, sides, and small plates that encourages you to share. My dining mate decided that he really wanted lasagna and of course we had to try the pizza. Since you could order the pizza with 2 different toppings, we decided to go with 1/2 Mushroom and 1/2 Burrata. The Burrata was an unexpected twist with salty prosciutto and bitter broccoli rabe with fresh mozzarella. Wow, this was the best part of the meal. Although I'm sure their desserts are awesome, we were so stuffed that we passed on it. I'm sure the next time I'm in town, I will be venturing to this place again for the pizza and room for dessert!

Summary: Excellent quality ingredients served with dedication in an elegant, but casual, atmosphere.  The vibe of the establishment reminded me of Porto's in that it's very loud, bustling, and sought after.  However, the likenesses end there as Bottega has no parking lot, has much higher prices, and ultimately leaves a question about value for the experience of dining.  To me, what I got just wasn't matched by what I paid. My first visit here was with two friends on a Wednesday night.  We arrived at around 730pm and the place was packed.  We were told an hour wait would be required.  To kill some time, we made our way to the bakery and picked out a couple Macarons each.  I had heard so much about these things that I figured at $2 each they must be amazing.  Given that they are about the size of Oreo cookies, they had better be amazing for $2 each.  They were not amazing. They were good, but not $2-each-good.  The texture of these little items is sort of crispy on the outside, soft/chewy at the next layer inside, and then a creme filling of some sort.  The problem for me was that the cakey/cookie part that was supposed to be soft was often dry and overly chewy.  The flavors were a range from so-so to pretty awesome.  In the course of the evening, I believe I tried 9 or 10 different flavors.  My favorites were the (surprisingly) the Earl Grey and the Green Tea, but still I couldn't justify $2 per cookie.  Sorry, I'm cheap/value-driven :) After killing more time at the bar across the street, we made our way back and were finally seated.  Our server was friendly and attentive throughout the meal.  He provided one of my friends with sparkling water while the other two of us had normal, sans-gas liquid.  Two lobster-claw shaped bread rolls were brought out for us to nosh on while we figured out our order.  We decided on starting with the Fried Mozzarella, and then each get a beer and a burger done somewhat differently. My burger was requested medium, add cheese, with bacon well-done, avocado, and grilled onions.  The other two burgers had combinations of avocado or bacon, and one was medium, and the other medium-rare.  It wasn't long before the fried cheese was brought out.  The price for this item is $8, and it included a single mozzarella stick on a plate with some marinara sauce on top.  I should have figured that, given the price of the macarons, this would be an unfortunate choice but we split it into three 1-inch squares of fried cheese and enjoyed what we could.  It was certainly well prepared and the flavors were excellent.  The outside texture was also well executed.  Just a terrible value. Finally the burgers arrived.  Unfortunately, this is where my experience somewhat didn't hit expectations, in particular.  The presentation was excellent.  The bacon was really tasty and crispy (splendid!).  But the burger was dry and over-cooked, the onions were not grilled, and the $2 addition for the avocado yielded a very small portion of the ingredient.  Kind of disappointing.  It was tasty, but not $16+$2/extra ingredient tasty.  The fries were actually my favorite part I think.  Excellent texture and very tasty.  Balanced well by the ketchup.  No ranch dressing here, btw, for those who are fans of dipping in that condiment. For dessert, we ordered 5 more macarons, one of which was not the one we ordered, so our server brought out a sixth one for us at no charge.  By that time we were pretty full, so we paid the check and made our way home. Ultimately, I'm glad I got to go and experience what the big hype is about.  I appreciate what the restaurant brings to the table as far as atmosphere and service goes, but food and value are fundamental to me.  There might be better items on the menu, maybe even better values, but I figure a burger is pretty straight forward and should be easily executed with mastery at the price point they are asking, and when it's not, it is somewhat disappointing.  Not to mention, $2/cookie is pretty exorbitant.

This place was hyped up to me the first time I went. I've been back multiple times not because I recommended the place, but due to the party I was with. List of foods: Pizza: like the consistency of the crust  Burrata: prosciutto. enough said  Clam: trying to be adventureous, it's neither good nor bad. Grilled Squid and Chorizo Ravioli: just okay. not very memorable Tomato Bruschetta: it's really hard to go wrong with this simple yet delicious dish Brussel Sprouts with Pistachios: some of the brussel sprouts were too bitter and undercooked Trenne: it's pasta with braised ribeye, kale and parmesan. I do not like this dish. It was just beef stew with what tasted like fried pasta. This was a total disappointment due to the fact the dish was recommended to me by the waiter after I asked for something refreshing and/or light pasta.   Tiramisu and Passion Fruit Eclairs: both good, no complaints Beignet (free) Macarons - I got a whole box with six different flavors and only listed the good/memorable ones  Earl Grey - best one  Pistachio and Mandarin - just okay  Rose - 2nd favorite The food is good, not great. What really gets the credit is their decor. The high ceilings with huge columns, big windows, half open kitchen and the dessert display hooks you in. The noise is overwhelming at times, but it's good to hear everyone enjoying themselves. Do not come here if you want a quiet dinner, you're not going to get it.

**REASONABLY-PRICED ITALIAN FOODS AND AMAZING SOUFFLE** PARKING ======== Free street parking on Sunday. YAY! AMBIANCE ========= Lofty, plain white interior, very European, and LOUD. FOOD ===== ORDERED: TOMATO SOUP ($8) Tomatoes, garlic herbed croutons, basil, extra virgin olive oil, fleur de sel & crème fraîche was piping hot delicious. A bit too thick for my personal taste buds, but it was indeed hearty. GRILLED ARTICHOKES ($10) One of my favorite tapas of the evening. Flavorful and beautiful. BRUSSEL SPROUTS & PISTACHIOS ($8) Another good tapas for Brussels Sprouts lovers. BURRATA PIZZA ($20) Burrata, Grana parmesan, rapini, garlic, extra virgin olive oil & prosciutto di Parma pizza was simple and delicious. I loved the crust. CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE ($15) Yes, it was a pricey dessert, but it was one of the best souffles I've had. Perfect textbook souffle in every way. It was worth the 20 minute wait. SERVICE ======== Good despite the fact that it was jam-packed with people. Attentive and professional staff. Our waters were consistently filled and my napkin was folded every time I returned from the ladies' room. OTHER NOTES ============ No reservations. We waited 10 minutes on a Sunday around 6PM. Dinner for 4 with wine and dessert was $150. Not bad. OVERALL ======== It's a good restaurant but nothing extraordinary. I personally thought it was too loud for a romantic date spot. I would recommend for families and groups.

Tonight, I enjoyed my weekly fix of the best hand made fresh tortillas.  Three of them in the form of 3 fresh yummy warm shredded chicken tacos from CafÃ Bottega Loui.  Only $1.75 each for Taco Tuesdays.  I really look forward to the consistently great service and food quality.  I always get chicken tacos. I usually only et two.  Tonight, I thought I could handle three.  They were all yummy, too yummy to waste but too much to eat and still feel physically comfortable.  I notice they have a great deal to add a heap of buttery looking rice and your choice of black or pinto beans and a drink for only $2.  Next week, maybe I'll try one taco with rice, beans and the drink.  But,definitely not three tacos all in one sitting. I love this place.

I swore that I would never venture downtown unless it is absolutely necessary. Well, this restaurant makes the weekly trip downtown "necessary" to me. Not only is the restaurant extremely good (you've got to try their portobello fries) , their bakery is even more amazing. From what I understand, the restaurant is Italian, but the pastry shop (le patisserie) is French. I found this place because a friend wanted to have lunch in downtown close to her work. It was a great choice as it was my first time there. Nevertheless, subsequent visits of mine were mainly for the macarons (yes, they're macarons - NOT macaroons my fellow Americans). Don't bother with any other imitation places if you are a macarons lover. I've tried all of them and this is as good as it gets unless you're in Paris and getting it at either Pierre Hermé or Ladurée. All and all, I've spent over $400 on macarons in the past 2 months at Bottega Louie. C'est parfait! PS - It's crowded and LOUD here, so don't expect an intimate and romantic dinner if you're going here on a date.

Macarons = 4.5 star Food = 3 star Salted caramel macarons are my favorite! I have yet to have better than Bottega Louie's salted caramel macarons!  Their earl grey macarons are my second favorite.  They have a bunch of other great flavors but in my book the two I mentioned are by far their best. Now onto their food. We started with the Portobello fries (battered and deep fried portobello mushroom). It wasn't as impressive as some of the reviews stated. It was so-so, a bit too oily and salty which was a little too much for me to handle. Now onto my pasta dish which I will rate as so-so.  I had the Trenne (pan sautéed trenne pasta with braised prime rib eye). The pasta was on the tough side so I didn't really enjoy it but the flavor wasn't bad. Our server was really friendly. We sat in the bar area which was first come first serve. Lunch time was super crowded but the ambiance was lively and the crowd was mainly the downtown business folks. Parking ranges about $5 to $10 in the nearby lots or you can find metered parking but in downtown LA it can be quite expensive. I think the meters near the restaurant run at about $4/hr. Best option is If you are able to take the redline metro, it's about 2 blocks from the 7th street station. Though I wasn't a fan of the food, I did hear that their brunch was quite good so I will update my review once I get around to checking it out.

I feel like I'm the last of my yelp friends to finally set foot into this place.  Almost 5000 reviews later, the only thing I've ever tried here without being here were the macarons (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…).  While they are good, I reserve the top to another establishment.  But, the bakery is only a 1/3 of the story at Bottega Louie. The atmosphere feels like an open air bazaar enclosed in its single room design with 30' high ceilings and tables strewn about its floor.  There are three main market stages; there is no real divide between the bakery, bar, and dining room.  Due to the very minimal décor, the patronage-created sounds can be deafening, but each table seems to have its own isolated conversations that most people can feel comfortable with by using well-trained ears.  I'm not a fan of this type of structure/atmosphere as I prefer somewhat of a more intimate setting when dining. It took 15 minutes before we were waited on with water, but our waiter Jonathan apologized and was very attentive afterward.  The water option is Still or Sparkling.  ALWAYS go Sparking since it's no extra charge!  My jaw dropped when I saw Jonathan plop our epi bread down on the table top (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…)!  If anything hits a bare table top in a restaurant, I won't eat it, but that's when I finally realized that the table was perfectly squared with white butcher paper.  The epi (artisan bread shaped like wheat) bread IS awesome and after our meal, Jonathan gave us several loaves to go as well.  Going with the most popular recommendation - we ordered the Portobello fries as our appetizer. These did not disappoint as these firm thick slices of mushroom heads were flour-battered and fried (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…).  The aioli dipping sauce was perfect to complement the nutty aroma and taste. The flavors are all very distinctly Italian/Mediterranean with generous uses of polenta, ricotta, parmigiano, garlic, fennel, truffle, panna cotta, and olive oil.  Our early dinner consisted of: - Lobster Nage Soup [8] - poached lobster served on a bed of cauliflower panna cotta with raisins and roasted almonds (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…).   This was a light and tasty starter to the rest of the meal. - 16 oz Rib Eye[35] - this bone-in rib eye was served with Kennebec (type of potato) fries and Béarnaise sauce on the side (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…).  This rib eye needed no sauce as a complement.  The steak was cooked perfectly as the fat melted in the mouth and it was not overly seasoned.  So having the option of Béarnaise is just a plus.  The Kennebec fries were sea salt and herb seasoned. - Short Ribs [25] - Braised beef short ribs served on a mixture of white polenta, sage and ricotta.  The ribs were topped with large dice-cut lardon ragu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…).  The ragu was sharply smoky, however the short ribs were room-temperature warm.  Not sure if this was the expected serving style - but would prefer it being served hotter.  The polenta was infused with the ricotta flavor and quite tasty. - Panna Cottta [9] - having already had their macarons, we opted to something lighter.  The vanilla panna cotta was initially sharply tart.  But, once the palette became accustom to the flavors - it was quite enjoyable.  The dish was topped with a blood orange gelee, accented with candied almonds, blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, and mint (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…). A sure return to Bottega Louie will be focused on Brunch, as there are so many recommendations from others.  I do like the food and its probably around a 4 - 4.5 in my book. People have identified the parking south of the restaurant for $5 parking.  For the cheap asses, the parking structure across the street on S. Grand offers parking for $4.  You should know which one I parked at!  ;P

LOVE Bottega Louie.  There are so many things that I love about this establishment.  I don't normally do a list format, but there are so many things I love. 1. Portobello fries, mmmm, amazing! 2. Peanut butter tart.  OMG 3. Macaroons, any flavor is heaven. 4. Service is impeccable. 5. decor.  love the clean and simplistic upscale look of the place.   My husband works in downtown LA and brings home treats from the bakery every once in a while and everything he brings home is always delicious.  He bought a chocolate birthday cake and it was seriously the best cake we EVER had!  Such a great restaurant all around.

I first came here because of their macaroons, and soon was drawn in by their food. The first time I had a meal here was for my 21st birthday. Me, being the broke college student that I am, only ordered about three dishes off of their small dishes menu and split it with my sister. But I was in for a treat on my birthday! Terry Hatcher was seated at the table next to mines! Despite my ordering small dishes, they were DELICIOUS! The second time, I came here for brunch and boy was I in for a delicious meal AGAIN! I had a bagel with smoked salmon and it was just PERFECTION! It may seem cliche, but just about everything at Bottega Louie is amazing. Even the service and waiters!

The noise level here is off the charts.  It's hard to have a memorable experience here until they do something about the noise. The bare walls and high ceilings make the acoustics here just plain terrible. We stopped here for brunch and here are our impressions: 1)  Modena salad is outstanding 2)  Macarons are just blah. Nothing spectacular really. 3)  Pizzas are generally good but stay away from the pepperoni. Way too spicy! 4)  The pear tart is just out of this world. Absolutely orgasmic. Not too sweet, just perfect. If it wasn't for the noisy acoustics and slow service, this could easily be a 5-star establishment.  If they improve those flaws soon, I will definitely come back.

Best pizza I've had in LA. Having lived in Chicago and NYC, my pizza standards are pretty high. I had long ago decided nowhere in CA could really rival what I had had on the East coast or Midwest. The crust here is thin and crispy, ingredients are bright and flavorful. The macarons are delightful, and the pretzel is the best I've ever had. Also you have to ask for the braided bread, it's so good - do ask for it. Great service. The place feels like a grand French palace (a la Versailles), but the food is casual and delicious. Can't wait to return!

SOOOO EFFING GOOD. I was visiting a friend in Culver City and we decided to check out this place based upon a recommendation another friend had given me and we were blown away by the place. For having over 4000 reviews, you have to know that this place is legit. Not only are the desserts eye catching and delicious, but their appetizers and entree items are to die for as well! We were greeted by our lovely server, who had great recommendations for us being first time customers of the restaurant. She was helpful and knowledgeable about everything on the menu. My friend and I ordered the portobello fries as our appetizer and were in bliss by how tasty they were! If you're undecided on an appetizer, give these a try. You won't be disappointed! Next, we decided to share their sausage pizza. They use fennel sausage which was soooo freaking good. It's making my mouth water just thinking about it! And the mozzarella was gooey and oh so yummy! ;D To end the amazing meal, we decided to share the creme brûlée and my friend and I were literally in heaven for the moments we consumed the delicious sweet. It was made to perfection. Lastly, I decided to buy a box of 13 macaroons which totaled $28! But it was well worth it. I haven't had great macaroons until I tried Bottega Louis'. I got one of every flavor they have except for the raspberry and dark chocolate macaroon. ALL of the flavors are SOOOOO GOOOOOD. My favorite is the pistachio! If you're in downtown LA, YOU HAVE TO GO HERE. Or you'll probably burn if you don't bother giving this place a try ;P

Bottega Louie is great I'm giving it 4 starts because of the noise level, if you want to have a nice/romantic conversation this is not the place to go, unless you're planning on "breaking up" because you are basically going to be yelling at each other during dinner The food is superb, try the "small plates" they go from $8 to $12 and is basically a portion for 2, everything is delicious They also have an amazing wine selection

Its a real beautiful restaurant but I'm not too too impressed. Since the restaurant has high ceilings, it echoes and it's very hard to hear your friends/date. The line is always long and the hostess are not too welcoming. The food is okay but the presentation is nice. I do like their mushroom fries, its different but good. If you like macaroons, its the place to go. You have a wide variety, but not cheap.

I was torn between 3 and 4 stars in reviewing this place only because I'm not a huge fan of macaroons period and that's one thing that they're known for. Also, I'm not too big on super sweet desserts and treats so another reason why. Also everything here is pretty pricey. But I absolutely love the decor and setting. Don't judge me but it feels very French and cozy. If you're a chick, you'd probably give this place a 6/5 because of the macaroons here and also the other foods they serve and also for the interior design. If you're a dude, bring a date here. Only thing is, it's super busy. You'd be hard pressed to find an empty table with chairs but if you go on a date and you find one, hold on to it for dear life. It's hard to miss if you're walking in this area since it's on the corner of the street intersection. Parking: Limited street/metered, paid parking lot Price: For a full meal about $25-$40/person Wait: Long

I was a little skeptical about checking this place out before going to Seven Grand across the street and I was pleasantly surprised!  We just had some pastries but they were very very good!!!  Didn't get anything else but I was impressed enough to want to go back sometime and try a lot of other items on the menu!

Great place for breakfast.  I had a farmers market breakfast consisting of vegetables and two boiled eggs.  It was very healthy and delicious.  The fresh orange juice was refreshing and service was friendly and  efficient. The ambience of the place was pleasant and the crowd very diverse.  I loved the the bakery goods.  The macaroons were outstanding.  There were gift packages to purchase for gifts.  I felt like I was in Italy,

I have wanted to try this place for so long but have never made the time to drive downtown for brunch. I don't think it's worth the hype- but the food is pretty good and I would be down to grab this once every couple of months. I found street parking a block away early Sunday morning and walked to the large, white facade and impressive glass windows. I was awed by the macaron trees and felt slightly underdressed wearing a v-neck and shorts on a hot summer weekend. Nevertheless, we were greeted kindly by the hostess and our server remembered my sister's name that was written in the guestbook. I got my bellini quickly, which was rather disappointing and small. It didn't taste very fresh. Maybe I just have bad luck with brunch drinks. The portobello fries came out next and they were quite good- fried with a delicately crispy skin but soft and savory on the inside. The flavor wore off after eating more and more of it though. The accompanying dipping sauce was great. I got the Farmer's breakfast which was not very balanced in terms of acidity. I feel like the vegetables and flavor didn't mix very well and the dish came out overall bland. Not recommended. On the other hand, my sister's lemon ricotta pancakes were great. The highlight was the thick homemade blueberry syrup- it crystallized after a while but was still so delicious. Overall I don't think the meal was worth it, but the ambiance was very nice and the service was great and I really enjoyed the setting in the middle of downtown.

We went twice in the span of 1 1/2 weeks because we thought, Hey, they're onto something here. Let's just say going on a Tues for an early dinner can be a 5-star experience, and going to a late dinner on a Saturday night a 1-star experience. This averages out to 3 stars but that's too f-n generous after my last visit. I'll take the Duck Prosciutto Crostini small plate over the Portobello Fries any day. The breading is funky, people! I'd order the orecchiette again but Jim said his chicken parm tasted like Olive Garden's. So what irks me is that the manager, after I told him one of his bartenders treated me like shit (using cleaner language of course) and helped an older couple wearing uppity clothes (she's gotta be a Housewife from somewhere), offered to "get" me a drink. Sure enough my glass of white wine was included on our check. Low-class service at a "high-class" establishment. Sliver of redeeming grace: the servers were excellent. But seriously: go in, grab your macaron tree, get the f out. You'll stand a better chance of having a 5-star experience every time if you don't venture past the bakery into the bar or dining area.

A must-visit LA restaurant. The food isn't great but I love the ambiance, decor, and everything else about this place. I love the white interior and high ceilings, the open kitchen, and dessert bar. I came here for dinner last night around 9:30pm. It was still really crowded, but there was no wait to get seated. The bread you get before your meal is really hard. Their pizzas are pretty good. Last night, we opted for a half margherita and half pepperoni pizza. You get a decent sized pizza for $20. I'm not a big fan of the macarons here. I haven't tried any of their other desserts, but all of them look delicious.

I was here on a Sunday for Brunch.  Just myself and another person so we got a table fast.  Probably waited only 5 minutes.  The place was crowded and loud.  People with large groups seemed to be waiting longer.  I love, love the open concept here.  The main kitchen and pizza kitchen are in plain sight.  You can see how your food is being made and who doesn't like that?  We got seated by the pizza kitchen.  All the pizzas look amazing!  I would like to try next time I'm there.  We both ordered brunch items and the portobella fries, omg!  amazing and very filling!  Must try!  They offer complimentary flat water and sparkling water.  Service was excellent!  I stopped by the bakery and purchased some macaroons, they have different options for dessert and everything looks great!  I can't wait to go back.

So i went from being lukewarm about this place to LOVIN IT!!! That sign-in book has always terrified me for some reason, and i've just visited the bakery and scurried away to another eatery a couple of times now, but dude, bestie and I held our ground this time and brunched here an excellent experience! I don't really understand how their "system" works but i was quite amazed. No ressies allowed, u put your name in and wait. They don't give you a buzzer or yell your name out (its BL for goodness sakes!)- they note your name and amazingly another host comes and finds you admist all the other parties waiting around. The server addresses you by name and we were lucky to score a FABULOUS waitress Aubyn- she's the best i've had in awhile. Loved how genuinely friendly she was and how she took the time to suggest her favorite dishes. Drinks were replenished without asking and we were never rushed through our meal. GREEN TEA ARNOLD PALMERS for the boys and ICE TEA for me. Although i don't use sugar, i love that they serve a lime, orange and lemon slice plus liquid sugar. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Table Bread (EPI) with butter http://www.yelp.com/biz_…. Yummy. They give this upon request. I forgot to ask for the berry jam. PORTABELLO MUSHROOM FRIES!!! ($10) A MUST ORDER. (Carol, i finally ordered them and they were AWESOME!!!). I'm so glad that we didn't pass up on ordering this. We ended up with too much food, but it was a concensus that these ROCKED. Dude went so far as to even say he enjoyed these more than the popcorn bacon he had at black hogg. GASP! I even loved the cilantro dip http://www.yelp.com/biz_… SMOKED SALMON BENEDICT ($18) Delicious salmon, perfectly runny eggs and served over yummy hashbrown patties instead of your traditional english muffins. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… LOUIE CLUB SANDWICH ($12). We saw them assembling these in the open kitchen area and i love clubs, so we ordered this. It was nice and light and served with nice potato chips. But compared to everything else, this was a little too mild. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… NY EGG SANDWICH ($8) Bread was fluffy and overall was a satisfying sandwich with the bacon and fried eggs, but we could have done without this one and probably should have skipped the two sandwiches and gone for the lobster hash. Next time! http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Parking- there's a couple of different lots behind the restaurant where u can find $4.00 to $5.00 parking on the weekends. Not a huge fan of their macarons, but i definitely loved BRUNCH here and i'm looking forward to crossing off more things off their menu!

With all the hype, my sister and I decided to finally try the macarons.  Busy Saturday night (mainly because of the restaurant area), loud but good atmosphere.  In and out in about 20 minutes.  Tried all 13 flavors ($26 for the set) - all delicious, but Salted Caramel and Pistachio were my top two.  A bit pricey but worth every penny.  Will be back to try the restaurant.

Not that this place needs yet another review... but here goes! This place is a great place to take people from out of town because it's gorgeous inside and the service is excellent.  And the prices of the entrees are reasonable so you can treat your out of town guest without secretly resenting them after settling up the bill.  Overall the food is decent.  I'm not really a fan of their pizza but i do enjoy their entrees and small plates. the burrata is delicious.  Their chicken with artichokes is good and citrusy and their trenne pasta plate was different (crunchy) yet also tasty.  brunch is fun.  the macaroons did not blow my mind but I've had other deserts there (cakes, tarts, etc) that were awesome. The only minor issue is if you plan on having any kind of meaningful conversation with your company because it's incredibly loud inside. I've saw a couple on a date there having a difficult time getting through the regular mundane personal details of their lives because it's was so hard for them to hear each other.  Also, it's packed virtually every hour of the day that it is open so be prepared to wait.

What more can be said about this place? Cute and classy interior, a decent wine bar, and amazing food for decent prices.  They don't take reservations so you might have to wait a while, but it's so worth it. Definitely recommend the portobello fries for the appetizer! If you like pasta, get the pasta trenne.  The hanger steak is also really good! And, of course, save room for the macaroons and other delish dessert options in the bakery :) I'm a sucker for the mini blueberry tarts!

Onto the bakery, I only tried the macrons but everything looked so good. as for the macrons - salted caramel rose and early grey PERFECTO

I would go back just to use their all white marble and gold restroom, and, feel like a Queen. However, the melt in the mouth macarons, the white and gold clean lines, the modest high ceilings, the great service, the gourmet pizzas, fresh seafood, the cute as a button chocolate boxes, the light and fluffly chocolate eclairs, and, the French brasserie vibe don't hurt either! Went there for breakfast, and, drove back all the way to downtown in the manic LA traffic for dinner. Go back? I want to live in a house that looks like Bottega Louie!

This review is only for their macarons! I've been meaning to try out their macarons for awhile - after hearing how good they are from almost everyone I know. I did so quite recently, and by the suggestion of the very nice cashier by the display stand, I got their early grey and lemon. They were good. Prior to indulging in a macaron, I feel as though I am about to commit a crime by cracking that perfect shell of smoothness embodied by the meticulously baked macaron cookie. It's a bittersweet feeling as I my taste palates are delighted, yet that once delicate surface is no more. Point being, I enjoy the crunchyness in a macaron. When I had my Louie ones, I felt that they were overwhelmingly chewy. They either didn't have the crunch or it was just forgotten since I took a longer time getting them down my throat than I do with lette ones. I don't know...as for now, I feel that I've been betrayed by all the hype I've received prior to my experience. And even in my past experience with them, all I remember is that they didn't leave me a strong enough impression for me to go again until now. I will definitely give them a try again in the future and update my review then, but as of now they are a-ok.

Bottega Louie is a place well known and a place you should try at least once to form your own opinions. Sister picked this place for us to try since we were already going to be in LA for the day. BOY am I glad she did! Of course we used YELP to see what dishes we should order ;) Yelpers led us to PORTOBELLO FRIES $10 and they were not wrong. Unique and tasty! I wasn't sure how they were going to be able to coat and fry this because of its moisture content but they did it with a cornmeal batter! Definitely worth a try if you enjoy portobello. Had to try the BRUSSELS SPROUT $8 with PISTACHIOS --I never thought of pairing these two and it was awesome! Ordering these again. We also ordered the MUSHROOM PIZZA $20, the cheese hardened way too fast :( flavor was good and the crust was nice and thin. I will pass on this one next time, I have had better gourmet mushroom pizzas.... I would also pass on the LAMB PORTERHOUSE $12 --not much flavor for me. For dessert we ordered the CHOCOLATE SOUFFLÉ $15, sister really enjoyed it. I'm not a fan of soufflés so I'll take her word on it :) Aaaaand of course you have to order their macarons. Many different flavors, not my favorite and I'd pass next time. Nice interior and great staff service. BOTTOM LINE: Another visit is in order :)

When I first stepped in, I was overwhelmed by the assortment of desserts and the space/interior design of the restaurant!  But I am conflicted.... The macarons deserve 4 stars. As you bite down on the macaron, you break the outer layer and dive into a yummy chewiness. My favorite is the salted caramel because the chocolate filling was thick and you can really taste the caramel. But the food deserves 2 stars. The menu and the dishes looked really good at fairly decent prices. But our dishes didn't taste as good as they looked. After watching Top Chef and Food Network, I really wanted to try asparagus with a poached egg because it seems like a simple dish but can be wonderfully made. Well...the asparagus was grilled too long...the tops were burnt and the stalks were wrinkly. The most interesting thing is that it came with an anchovy/balsamic vinegar sauce that didn't taste good at all. We also ordered pasta with tomato sauce that was good but cold.

I was too intoxicated to remember all the details, but I just remember thinking to myself these two things over and over that night at Bottega Louie. "Damn these macaroons are good", and " Damn all the people here are so beautiful". I dont think there's any other place in DT LA where so many of the young, beautiful, and successful come to grab dinner. It can be considered trendy... The macaroons are tiny and $2 a pop, pretty pricey but something you probably should try if you come. Going there before a Laker's game in a couple weeks with the company folks. Will be fun. if coming in a group, probably better to valet, if coming in a single car there's a parking garage just southeast of the restaurant.

Great food. Great drinks. Affordable, but classy. Fun Atmosphere. The only drawback is the acoustics. It's sooooo loud in there, and it's just because the ceilings are a mile high. It's a gorgeous place, but you might as well be eating in a church. Trenne Pasta with black kale and braised short rib pasta is amazing. By far, our favorite thing on the menu.

The first words out of my mouth were:  "OMG look at all the beautiful people!"  Seriously, I could kill hours here just looking at the folk who are here to be seen! I digress; got here rather late after some friends brought us here.  We had already eaten dinner, but couldn't miss out when a table by the bar opened up, and boy, did we pounce on that table.  Opting for small dishes, we got to sample the Portabella Mushroom Fries (boyfriend loved), the bruschetta (I loved), and the prosciutto with seasonal fruit (we both loved).  Although it was loud, it was kind of a romantic atmosphere, being squeezed onto a little table with a single candle.  I really would love to try the pizza next time. But the piece de resistance, of course, were the macaroons.  I'm not a macaroon fan - not that I hate them, I just am not obsessed with them - but these were truly wonderful.  My boyfriend picked three, and I did the same, and we took those babies to go and indulged in macaroons in our hotel bed.  A must-visit, when I get the chance to see LA again.

Bottega lives up to the hype, I think. I just loved it; its busy, bustling, and you feel like its where everyone wanted to come for dinner on a Frdiday night. Is a huge, clean, white space, part bakery, part seating, & it has an open kitchen & separate pizza oven area. We only waited maybe 10-15 minutes at about 9pm on a Friday. Common was eating behind us, the sole male in a group of like 5 women, & that upped, the cool factor for the evening. Usually I hate everyone, but I didn't mind this crowd for some reason. I think it's cause I love DTLA so much.  We ordered drinks at the bar while waiting, but as soon as we got them our table was ready. There were 2 of us, so that helps get seated quick. We ordered the artichoke pizza & meatball Parmesan sliders. The pizza is sooo good, and we determined its because the dough is sourdough! Genius!  our food totaled $40, plus drinks ($22) and of course a to-go order of Macaroons. They're melt in your mouth amazing.

I first came here 2 years ago and I've been coming ever since. They make fresh pasta, pizza, salad...everything. Their drinks are amazing. Try their Cucumber Martini, it's to die for. Expect to wait even on weekday evenings, this place is gets packed. It's beautiful, fun, clean, friendly, and worth the wait. Don't mind the snobby LA people, they're everywhere, just enjoy your food and throw and elbow at em :)

I would love to transplant this place here to Oklahoma!  What I would love my own restaurant to be like! This is my favorite go-to place in California!  Great food and it's reasonably priced too!  Service is quick and waiters are very friendly!  The open concept here  with the kitchen and bakery gives you a very spacious feel.  Love picking out tons of small plates and sharing it!  Everything I've had there is so yummy!  The bakery selection will get your mouth watering before you even sit down!   The only TINY gripe is the tables are a little small.  But everything else outweighs that!

This is one of my favorite places in DTLA! I love coming here. I'm always intrigued that their kitchen is not hidden! You can watch them cook if you're seated close to the kitchen! They have a separate kitchen for pizzas so you can also watch them prepare your pizza & toss it into the stone oven! They have a separate area for the bar. Another separate area for their desserts http://www.yelp.com/biz_… & bakery http://www.yelp.com/biz_… & deli. They have everything here!! Awesome atmosphere. The only downside is that it's really loud once you walk in. Complimentary sparkling water http://www.yelp.com/biz_… & interesting looking bread http://www.yelp.com/biz_… to start off the meal. Trenne ($16.00) http://www.yelp.com/biz_… - This was delicious & fun to eat because the trenne pasta was crispy. It came with braised prime rib eye & it was so tender & juicy from all the sauce. Would definitely order this again in the future. Ceppo gamber ($16.00) http://www.yelp.com/biz_… - Another delicious dish, I only took a bite out of this one & I really enjoyed the flavor. Orecchiette ($14.00) http://www.yelp.com/biz_… - Didn't really like this because it tasted bland. My cousin didn't like the texture, it was too "doughy" for her & she said it needs more sauce. Macaroons http://www.yelp.com/biz_… in order of my favorite flavors that I've tried so far: earl grey, rose, pistachio, salted caramel, espresso, matcha, passion & lemon. They're $2 each, expensive .. but one of my guilty pleasures so I don't mind from time to time. I can't wait to come back here to try more dishes.

Atmosphere: classy but NOISY. Beautiful display of their desserts and especially those macarons! Bathrooms are kept clean as well :-) Service: genuine and friendly for the most part. Jason (sorry for name dropping) was an a-hole though. The house was packed but to my surprise we were still seated immediately! Food: My favorite by far is the trenne pasta (pan sauteed trenne pasta with braised prime rib eye, Tuscan black kale and shaved grana parmesan). The pasta was crunchy good, nothing like any others I've tasted. The rib eye was so very tender it melted in my mouth... -The portobello fries are a must try -Burrata pizza is yummy but VERY oily. Two slices filled me up quick. -Macarons are delightful but pricey. I like earl grey and pistachio. A box of 12 is $24. Parking: is a nightmare. Thought it would be cheaper to street park, but it cost $5 for one hour.... Bike instead.

These stars are only for the macarons. $2 each and the their selection is heavenly! My favorite: Passion Fruit. It even has a small piece of fruit inside! Other flavors I've tried: Pistachio - would like it if it had more nutty flavor Salted Caramel - a denser macaron. Tasted almost like a brownie Earl Grey - this one's really pretty to look at with the gold flakes on top. But...can't differentiate the taste Strawberry - a little too sweet for me Mandarin Chocolate - an orangey and dark chocolate combo Macarons are definitely a luxury, but at $2 a piece for this quality, it's worth it. I've seen other places charge almost double, for the same size, and the density + chewy factor didn't compare to Bottega. I also bought on impulse the $1 Beignet. Meh. Just a soft sugar donut and it's not warm. Also, a Pistachio Cupcake since it looked so cute. Ugh, so much CREAM. Don't bother! Their eclairs in the other display case looked awesome though! Like jewel sticks. Will try next time. Open 'till 12 AM

I don't know if I should like or not like the fact that they don't take reservations. This place is classy, nicely structured, and well kept with their clean marble floors and fancy dessert macarons. I love how you can see the chefs work on the dish in a clear view. Their presentation, service, and integrity with food is excellent. Everything on their menu is pretty good so order anything friends. I almost had a 15-minute crush on this Asian waiter named Jason. He brought this tiny slice of dessert which I don't remember what it was but he made my birthday experience so fun I forgot what I ate that night. I wrote my name and # and tried to pull a call me maybe by writing on the paper covers of the table. I've always hated that song. of course it didn't WORK! but that's fine life goes on and I'll just take it as he was taken. Anyways, i really like this restaurant. I wish my dad owned it. Maybe later I'll create a better restaurant than you Bottega.

Pastry case: I find that the pastry selection is freshest on Thursdays and Saturdays. The macarons are fine. The cupcakes are not worth trying. The beignets are great, as are the passionfruit tart, eclairs (as long as they are fresh), chocolate tart, verrines, fruit tart, and frasier. The restaurant: Too loud to conduct a conversation during busy hours, the Italian food is fine, but nothing stands out.

Came here on a sunday around 7 and the place was packed!! But it only took us 10 minutes to get a table. They will acknowledge you by your name, so if you watch closely you will notice the host writing down a description of you when you give your name. Even before you enter the place will take your breath away with it's tall ceilings an marble flooring...even the restrooms have marble flooring w/gold & white accents. The bakery is def worth checking out w/it's impressive dessert spread. We were sat right next to the window...I love chipotle and our window gave us a view of it so i was happy..but my bf could see a lot of pedestrians walking by including homeless people which does take away from the magic of the place...you should def request to be sat away from the window The service goes at a leisurely pace & while our server was good the length of time to which he maintains eye contacts is a bit intense and awkward. Portobello FrIes $10: The sauce that comes with this is amazing but the fries...not so much. Of course these don't seem like fries at all aside from the fact that they are cut in long strips...it's sprinkled w/cheese but not evenly at all. It seems like they seasoned it after they plated it which makes most of it bland...def not meant to be eaten alone. I don't see what the big fuss is about and would not recommend this. Club Sandwich: Cut in 4 pieces w/Fries $12: Def one of the best Club Sandwiches we've ever had. They do it well and have that special touch...n e one that likes club sandwiches should try it. Le Grand Macaron $9: I ordered this because I thought it was cute..and i love macarons..but it was sorely disappointing.  The macaron was subpar and the vanilla ice cream too sweet. The berries were too tart and did not compliment the dish at all. I would not recommend this to anyone! Macarons: yum!! Best I ever had...comparable to L'ette's! $9/5 (purple box) macarons Matcha...i wish it was less sweet but that's just my preference for green tea Violet Cassis...we're told this is one of the most popular & it was very good Strawberry...they did well on this one Espresso...one of my fave flavors to get n e where & bottega got it just right!! Amazing coffee flavor...great for any coffee lover! Rose: I rarely encounter rose flavor but I always love it when i do & they did this one very well I am def coming back during the holidays & to get more macarons!! tip: free metered parking on sundays

This is a good standby.  Food is consistently good, and service is fast.  The layout of the restaurant is flexible for those who just want to come for dessert and drinks too. If I was just coming here for desserts I give it 5 stars (hence this review). For main's, I give it something slightly less.  Mainly, I'm a big pizza fan.  I make my own from scratch using a big green egg at 700 degrees and they come out fantastic. The pizza here is slightly off the mark. I crust is not fluffy enough and they tend to be a bit bland.

I've decided that Bottega Louie is my new happy place. Just a few blocks from the hustle and bustle of the financial district is an oasis of impeccable interior design and gorgeous sweets. This could shape up to be a very expensive and unhealthy habit, but I'm willing to take that risk. After a grueling day downtown, my friend and I decided to pop in for some pastries and chit-chat. I had an amazing chocolate financier (pronounced fee-nan-see-ay, with some Frenchy swag) that tasted like Christmas mixed with L.A. It was kind of a cross between a dense brownie and a sticky toffee cake, with a strong chocolate flavor and a small pool of light caramel on the beveled top. A football-shaped scoop of smooth, luscious vanilla bean cream was perched happily on top of the financier. And the garnish of gold-dipped candied almonds really made this dessert for me - fresh, crunchy, lightly toasty almonds! Perfection. The tiramisu was tasty and beautifully presented as well, but I'd go with the financier any day. Gorgeous interior - a wide open space of mostly white and gold accents, with marble-looking counters and pops of color from the packaged sweets. The place looks like someone plucked it from New York and plopped it on the West Coast. We need more establishments like this in L.A. Apparently they also offer real food here...perhaps on my next visit!

One star off because our waiter was waaaaayslow taking our order and a little socially removed. Other than that it was amazing! Came in around 2:30 for a later lunch with my mom. Very large crowd still, despite being past the lunch hour. Beautiful decor and baked goods up front. We split the portabello fries which were incredible, and the artichoke pizza. If you are not a garlic fan DON'T ORDRR THIS. Luckily, we loved it. I will for sure be back... maybe next week.

1. Atmosphere - Interior is beautifully designed with high vaulted ceilings, open kitchen, macaron displays, and pizza brick oven, that give you a sense that you're eating in a nice art gallery or old bank. It's very LOUD. Good for a big party but not necessarily a romantic date. 2. Food - Had the famous Portabello fries, Mushroom pizza, and Trenne pasta. Portabello fries were immensely over-hyped. The batter tasted like a mix of original Pringle chips and a blooming onion, not tasty at all. The sauce people rave about was just pesto and mayonnaise. 5/10 Mushroom pizza - Had a good white sauce with plenty of garlic and was large enough to share. It was my favorite. 7/10 Trenne - I enjoyed the hardened baked pasta dish for its unique and interesting texture. It tasted more like a beef stew than pasta, though. Girlfriend didn't like how hard and chewy the actual pasta was. 6/10 Macarons - This is what they are really known for. $2 a piece. I generally never think macarons are worth their price, but some are willing to pay. Friends tell me they are some of the best they've had. They say 9/10 In summary, go there for the macarons or for a social meal with friends, just don't expect the best food.

We had to try all the different yummy flavors! Also we stayed and ate for lunch. It is very cute/fancy. The artichoke pizza was very delicious and flavorful. I want to take my guy here so we can try more of their different entrees! I know he will definitely like this place. Make sure to try to come during lunch when its not too busy. Last time i tried to come at 8pm at night on a Friday, the line was out the door to eat. So come when its not too busy so that you can enjoy the full experience of the restaurant/bakery!

Bottega Louie has become one of those must-do's in DTLA in the 3+ years it's been open. Whether you are in the mood for some good Italian food, a glass of wine, or macarons, this spot is a destination for all of your senses! The place looks positively palatial, with its white marble floors, bare white walls, and expansive ceilings with just a dash of scrolled columns. Be aware that all that flat-ness translates to a punishing noise level, as it will sound like you're in a cafeteria. Azya C. and I started with their signature dish, the portobello mushroom fries. As someone who doesn't really like mushrooms (but who is always willing to try the "signature dish"), I was surprised at how much I liked these, and I mostly chalk that up to the garlic aioli that they are served with. We split the burrata pizza, and I love that their pizzas are made neapolitan-style here. Thin, but chewy crust, quality toppings, and perfect for sharing. Here's the thing about Bottega Louie: You may find better versions of a lot of their individual items elsewhere. Yes, that includes the macarons. I'd even suggest going down the street to Colori Kitchen for better Italian food. But for the experience, for people-watching, and for the combination of all the things that have made this a place that people will wait for 2 hours to dine at, you've just got to come here.

This place has such an elegant display of desserts.  Ordered a few macaroons, mini desserts and also grabbed a table to sit down and eat.  The place is quite busy and although it took a little long for the food to come, it was well worth it.  Ordered a pork sandwich which I can't remember the name of and also ordered an egg and Bacon branch sandwich.

This place is so cute! I don't know how long I've been coming here, but.... their brunch, breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, bakery... all worth coming for. SERVICE: Usually it's good. During crazy, busy, weekend brunch time....they aren't so good. :( BEST: Portobello fries!!! Bianco pizza. Arugula Salad. Italian soda. Lox. Go for brunch to get the breakfast AND lunch options (and bellinis and mimosas). The pastries, macarons, and other baked goods are definitely things you should pick up before you leave! There's a large parking lot right behind the place. There are also parking structures nearby. There's also street parking but, c'mon, it's L.A. - don't expect to find any near Bottega Louie.

My family and I were in downtown to check out the jewelry district, so we decided to eat here for brunch.  I've heard so many great things about this place, so I thought we'd check it out since we were in town.  Be sure to carry cash on you.  There is a parking lot next door for $5.  The restaurant is very trendy....a huge white room.  The desserts displayed were so pretty.  We were seat right away.  My husband ordered the lobster hash and I ordered the eggs benedict.  They were both delicious, but the portions were too small for my husband.  I asked for a side dish of fruit for my son, and it came in such a cute little package.  My son loved it....although it was just strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and pineapple.  Our server was very friendly and attentive. Of course, we had to order their famous macaroons on our way out.  They're a bit pricey, but we're not in the LA area very often.  I would say my favorite ones are the strawberry and espresso macaroons.   It's a great place to eat, but be prepared to spend some money.

Had very high expectations for this place, but alas was rather disappointed.  The service was great as was the decor, however, the food was just not that delicious.   Had the portobello fries, sea bass, and tagliatelle and were all mediocre.  The fries are definitely overrated, tasting somewhat mushy and doughy.  The sea bass was dry and flavorless.  The tagliatelle was also somewhat dry with an average texture.  The chocolate soufflé was tasty but not enough for us to leave satisfied.  Not even a few extra macaroons, which were also just average. Was worth a try and made for an interesting visit to downtown LA, but probably won't come back again.  Plus a 45 minute wait at 10pm?  No thanks.

200th Review ---- & I still am IN LOVE with Louie's. Unforunately since my first review this place has become almost too popular. I've tried coming here a handful of times, only for them to tell me "2 hour wait". & they DONT do reservations! AHHH! It's one of those places where I'd love to bring a guest, but if it's too long of a wait I'll press on somewhere else. Good luck skwirming your way through the masses, when I say it's packed, I mean its PACKED! Don't be anxious if there is a wait time between everything, with the amount of people dining here it's understandable - & you'll notice that everyone is running their ass off. If you want to eat right away, don't bother coming in after 7:30P - try and get their earlier (we came in on Friday around 7 and got seated right away - which is RARE!) More items I've tried from the menu: ________________________________ Lyonnaise Salad: if you're into all those fancy greens, eggs & big thick chunks of bacon- you'll love this! Modena Salad: uhhh, anything with butter lettuce is my fav - plus it's topped with the best candied walnuts, cheese, herbs and a balsamic viniagrette Tomato Soup - delicious, almost wish I had a grilled cheese to go alongside it! Beignets - don't expect the standard "powdered" beignet- these puppies are covered in standard sugar (almost tastes like a sugar donut hole) - & the raspberry sauce on the side is sweeeetness! Drinks - martinis, cocktails... they're all delish!

While I haven't given up on my mission to try each pizza that Bottega Louie offers (as of right now I'm 3 for 8) I've also added on the very important mission to try each and every macaron they offer... After having dinner at Perch with a girlfriend, we decided to stop by Bottega and have some macarons. Of course I was aware of the hype about macarons, attributing it as the next big "it" dessert following the popularity of cupcakes. Everyone I knew was ranting and raving about it and posting pictures of these round colorful discs all over Facebook.  I quickly dismissed them as an average sweet treat linking them to icky store-bought creme filled rectangular wafers. How ignorant I was (smh). When you enter Bottega, their bakery section entices you with all sorts of yummy looking desserts and pastries, but the macaron display will definitely catch your attention with its organized rows of colorful discs begging for you to look, touch, and finally taste. My friend, who has had Bottega's macarons before (and loves them), easily ordered 8. Me, aka the newbie, only ordered 3: 1) Salted Caramel: my absolute favorite of the 3 2) Earl Grey: very subtle flavor of tea 3) Pistachio: couldn't really taste any flavor, but that could be attributed to the mere fact that I practically inhaled the other 2 macarons with no time to give my palette a break.   The crisp yet moist texture of the outer shells along with the subtle flavor of the creamy filling was enough to make me wonder what the hell I was thinking in associating this lovely dessert with those icky store-bought, creme filled rectangular wafers I'm just glad that I've now been schooled in what a macaron is, so much so that I'm jumping on the bandwagon and ranting and raving all about them :)

Pros: -The space is gorgeous. -Soaring ceilings and an open kitchen that's fascinating to watch while waiting for a table. - Convenient parking with a flat rate $4 across the street (Saturday night) - Some very attentive waiters (I was with a very large group, right next to the waiter station, however, so it might have just been because we were in the middle of everything) Cons: - For a restaurant with an Italian name, the pasta was completely disappointing. I ordered the Italian salad (tasty), clam linguine (not fresh noodles, sauce was watery) and macarons (okay). I apparently made the mistake of not ordering the portobello mushroom fries, but that's not what I would have expected to order at such a nice restaurant for dinner. - Quite loud. We were a big group and it was hard to talk across the table Overall, it's a nice location, but I was unhappy with the quality of food for the money.

This place has the best pastries and desserts in LA. The only downfall is that it is really pricey. There's also a little restaurant area and bar. The restaurant is okay and the bar is pretty cool because it's a FULL bar. Anyways, I came here last week with a girl friend of mine and we ended up purchasing 13 Macarons for $26. That price wasn't too bad considering that I've had more expensive ones that didn't taste as good. They were also fresh. The guy kept coming out of the back with new and fresh Macarons. So that made them taste even better. I think my favorite flavor of theirs was the rose. I am a big fan of everything rose flavored. We also got the Tarimisu. It was definitely mouth watering. Each slice had a raspberry, blue berry, and black berry suck on a corner with raspberry creme. It was delicious and refreshing. Overall, the place looked fabulous and the food was delicious. The downfall was just the pricing, but I guess it was kind of worth it if you love desserts!

YOU THINK YOUR FANCY, HUH..??? As we approached the gold inscription on the entrance step, acting as a floor mat into the grand hotel-esk structure with hundreds of macarons insight, I hesitated and threw a quick question to my brain, "do they allow kids"? Without so much cognitive dissonance I pushed my burnt orange double stroller through the glass double doors to embark on the fanciest cafeteria looking establishment, named Bottega Louie. Without to much push from crowding; we made it to the seating desk and I was offered the option to have my stroller next our table or in the manager's office, I picked the office. We were seated very quickly and our server Mr. Pedro approached with a smile, offering the chance to be fancy with an option of Sparkling H2o or H2o. I ordered the fancy H2o thinking the carbonation would taste somewhat good during the heat wave So Cal. was experiencing. Wrong..... I kindly let Pedro know that I was not fancy at all and was need for a cold glass of regular H2o and a Belgian Beer ($7 per pint). As we studied the menu trying our hardest to Google all the ingredients mentioned in something as simple as a  "pizza" we relied on Mr. Pedro to step up and give the run down on what to order. Appetizer: PORTOBELLO FRIES $10 Fried battered mushrooms that resemble biscotti (Must try) Meal: BURRATA PIZZA $20 Not sure if this is on the menu? Very light mozzarella cheese pizza with a thinly sliced ham and maybe a veggie involved (Very Very thin Pizza) Meal: MEATBALL SLIDERS $12 3 sliders with one meatball inside each, a hunk of provolone cheese, tomato sauce and some fries on the side. (Must try) Dessert: LE GRAND MACARON $9 Vanilla macaron the size of a Frisbee golf disc with ice cream and berries in the middle. (Might as well...The place is known for "macaron") Dessert: BUTTER SCOTCH BUDINO $9 Custard with whip cream on top (order if you enjoy kahlua or baileys in coffee) If you are feeling FANCY or NOT; drive down check this place out, because apparently it seems cool to let everyone know that you had a "Macaron" at Bottega Louie and the food is pretty Good! BOTTEGA LOUIE 4-STARS

Bottega Louie has undoubtedly become a downtown staple in the past several years. Chic, lively and insanely busy almost all the time. Amazing, vibrant atmosphere. They do not take reservations; you must put your name down when you arrive and make sure your whole party is there. You can also try to grab a small table in the front of the restaurant which are first come, first serve. Service is consistently exceptional. I recommend the portobello fries (must try), caprese salad and any of their pizzas. Their macarons are to die for. I always go home with a box of 5. Definitely a crowd pleaser. If you have a friend visiting downtown, you know where to take them!

Wow ... just wow!  I doubt Bottega Louie needs another 5 star review, but I'll throw my thoughts into the ring. One of my daughters and I went to Bottega Louie before a performance at Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.  Parking was a $5 flat rate right next door.  It was an admittedly early dinner,  so getting seated right away was not a problem.  From what I hear, they do not take reservations and the wait can be a bit during more peak dining hours.  Had I had to wait more than 15-20 minutes, Bottega Louie would have been pulled down immediately to a 4 star ranking, but that was not an issue. Fabulous staff, our waiter was friendly, informative and efficient.  Beautiful "different" restaurant, with soaring ceilings and huge ornamental crown mouldings, on nothing but white, white and more white.  Seating was comfortable, with 1/2 booths - 1/2 chairs and larger tables for bigger parties.  Sparking or still water served complimentary.  The main kitchen-cooking area can be seen after you've walked past the very crowded and busy (good sign) bakery area.  The pizzas are cooked in a completely separate kitchen with a stone oven.  At the end of the meal, our waiter went and got our dessert goodies to go for us so we didn't have to stand in line, score! As for the taste and quality of the food at Bottega Louie, every morsel eaten was delicious. Salad Modena: Butter lettuce, candied walnuts, crumbled goat cheese, shallots, garden herbs & creamy balsamic vinaigrette.  Yum Factor is 4.5 out of 5, candied pecans would have been best! Pizza:  1/2 Sausage & 1/2 Burrata wth prosciutto.  Yum Factor is 5 out of 5, awesome dough/crust, the drizzle of olive oil was over the top good. Chicken Carciofi:  Pan sautéed chicken, artichoke hearts, capers, roasted garlic, garden herbs & white wine.  Yum Factor is 5 out of 5...maybe more!  Every perfect bite of tender and moist chicken was savored in that awesome sauce. Creme Brulee:  a beautiful creamy custard with a great crust that wasn't too thin or too thick and cracked beautifully.  Served with fresh berries.  Yum Factor is 4.5 out of 5, raspberries go so good with this dessert, but not a fan of blueberries with it. My daughter got a small, super pretty, bright pink box of Macarons to go, courtesy of our fab waiter.  She said they were awesome. We were asked towards the beginning of our meal if we wanted their ever-popular Chocolate Souffle, which would take 15-20 minutes.  We said no, perhaps a mistake?!  Not really, because now I have a reason to come back. Clearly I highly recommend this HOT eating spot and it appears that you can't go wrong with just about any selection of food.

We came here to surprise a birthday girl! That did not go well. First, you can only put your name down if your whole party is here, never mind if it is supposed to be a surprise, if you came an hour and a half early, if you're the governor of North America or if you bribe them. Not too sure about the last two, actually. Second, if you fib and put your name down and they text you and you don't respond because your whole party is not here because the birthday girl was taking her sweet time oblivious to all things timely and sensible, your table is given up. On a Saturday night, the wait is about 40 minutes. So anyway, + Parking lots are available next to the restaurant, but I parked across the street for $4 on the weekend. $4 + crossing the street beats $5, no? Apparently not according to the droves of people who dutifully parked in the $5 lot. + Split into dining area, bar/pastries area, bakery, kitchen area enclosed by glass + Complimentary bread and butter all night! + They carry the Sofia Riesling ($36) that you can get at Costco ($20)! + Portobello fries ($10): the tartar sauce makes the dish. I dipped calamari in the tartar and it was like I was eating portobello fries. + Scallops ($12) were really freaken good! + Mash potatoes ($8) are always good. + Snazzy bathrooms + Service: the waiters are attentive, friendly and eager to give advice. - The pizza ($20) is alright. I spent too many days craving pizza with stringy cheese piled high with stuff. This pizza here is thin and sparse and elegant and generally for dieters. Serves 6. - Chocolate Souffle is not as chocolately as you would think it would be. Also not very sweet. I basically doused each bite with cream sauce. - I'd never pay $2/ macaron for myself. But then again I don't like macarons. They come in a super cute box that I would actually pay $2 for, and they (the boxes) make snazzy gifts. - Loud. I could not hear the people sitting in front of me 3 feet away without them raising voices. - No waiting area. I stood around awkwardly and walked around aimlessly and stood around some more while I waited for my party to arrive. Overall this is a high-ceiling, really impressive, super loud, rather pricey place for important events. If I were to come again, I would order the fries and scallops, but I most likely won't make the hassle back.

I came to this joint strictly for the french macarons.  My ultimate favorite ones to get are coffee, pistachio, vanilla, and the best one ever: salted caramel.  The salted caramel macarons are to die for.  I would actually get a box of 5 of those, and another variety box of 5 of 1 of each of the other flavors.  But you MUST get more than 1 of the salted caramel ones, or you will definitely regret it.   This places gets super busy, and it's not a place to take someone on a date to go eat brunch or something because it's super loud in the restaurant.  I suggest coming to buy dessert, or having a quick bite.  Definitely not a place to hang out and chill over some mimosas.  Too hustle bustle in here!

I'm kind of mixed about this place. It's nice, the service is good, the food is prepared fresh, but my pasta was not so good. Maybe it just want to my taste. However, I have to review on food because, after all, this is a restaurant. The wait was extremely long, but we did have a party of 5. Still, it took an hour to be seated. While we waited, my boyfriend and I looked at their desserts section. They have a wide variety of macrons. I'm not really a fan of macrons but I actually liked some of these. The one that really stuck out to me the pistachio flavored one. It was good! Anyways, that was enough to kill the hour wait so we watched the chefs prepare the dishes. The kitchen has glass so you can see exactly how your food is made. There are no doors to the kitchen. Everything is fresh and made as you order it. Yelp said the trenne was good so I de died to try it. Well, it's alright. They fry it on one side so the noodle is crispy but it actually just tasted stale to me. The sauce and the meat in the pasta was nothing special either. However, I did enjoy the portobello fries. It's is a big deal for me because I do not like mushrooms. Having said all of this, mushroom fries is not worth an hour wait and the expensive price of our meal. The trenne is not for me, but other people like it so I guess it just depends on preference.

I absolutely loved the atmosphere here! Simple, white walls, high ceilings, and dim lighting. All very romantic except I was there with two girlfriends haha! Anyways, this place seems to be always crowded and I think it's a good reason. Of course, you have to purchase some macarons!! It's like going to Extraordinary Desserts in San Diego and not ordering a dessert...the cute little dessert sandwhiches are what sets this place apart from other LA eateries. Only bad thing is that these little babies are expensive as efffffffff. $2 each!! But so worth it for that 1 minute of bliss. I could probably finish them in 2-3 bites but I try to take small ones to savor them as long as possible. My favorite flavor would probably be salted caramel! Salty sweet goodness. The entire bakery area is just too cute to pass up, especially since it's right in front of you when you walk in. For the food, my pasta was good, but nothing too special. It was called Ceppo Gamber. The shrimps were pretty large though so thumps up for that! I'm also a sucker for roasted tomatoes. Mmm! The Portobello fries were a new food adventure that I really liked! Obviously, only order them if you truly enjoy mushrooms though. They were breaded lightly so it wasn't like they were made tempura style. The mushroom taste was still very powerful. So bottom line is get some macarons no matter what!!!

It's a nice spot for breakfast.  Be sure to get there early cause it gets packed on the weekends! We had a number of different dishes to share: Arugula salad - so yummy! Not too dressed up and super fresh ingredients New York Egg Sandwich - not bad for $8 Smoked Salmon Benedict - I didn't like the flavor of the salmon or their hollandaise sauce, not was I a fan of potato pancake it sat on - not worth $18 French Toast - dry Portobello Fries - overrated, it's the dipping sauce that makes it good Angus Beef Hamburger - thanks! Nephew for letting me try some of this burger, it was great! I can see why people jock this place, but I wasn't that impressed.

5 stars for their desserts --BEST BEST BEST macarons (not be confused with the coconut macaroons) in Southern California.  Their selection is huge:  orange, lemon, black currant, dark chocolate, rose, pistachios, and many many MANY more.   *the FILLING:  they use GOOD ingredients.  Not artificial or powdery stuff. *the macarons are light and airy.  Not too chewy or hard.  You can save them in the fridge and take them out for a few minutes to thaw out and it's good as new.  We usually buy like 18 macarons and eat them throughout the week.   CON:  be careful that they use the complimentary boxes  and not the gift boxes. Those cost money of course and are just slightly nicer than the free ones. Don't waste your  money. PASSION FRUIT ECLAIRS:  Holy cow!  These are delicious.  The passion fruit filling jumps out and satisfies your palate with it's citrus flavors and the outside is covered with a "brush" of sugar glaze and it has bits of "gold" like dust on it.  It's beautiful and yummy.  Make sure you eat these same day. They do not taste good once you save them. The outside gets hard. TARTS:  they have a wide selection of these babies.  The crust is nice and buttery and the fillings are great. Pick the filling that you like of course. Dont go fancy. Stick to what you know.   --Chocolate ones were ok. --Key Lime was good. 3 stars for their food.   Service was ok. But, unfortunately you can't help but feel a little "small" when you eat here. The waiters are a bit SNOOTY!  At the bakery too. We got their at about 10am and we were right in between breakfast ending and lunch just about to be served.  We ended up having lunch.  BREAKFAST menu (weekday) is small.  I just remember bagels! Ok...so - Pizza and fried mushrooms & zucchini at 10:30am didn't quite FLOAT my boat.  It was good. But, nothing special. Perhaps I should come back on a weekend and try their brunch.  I heard that was better. Parking:  your typical LA parking.  Bring change for the meters or go to the parking structures. Careful w/ drop offs - there are cops everywhere.

I'm not saying bottega is bad. I'm just saying I hate it. The food is soulless, and the place is so trendy it hurts my eyes. Macarons ($2 per) are decent, but I prefer the ones at 'Lette, which are lighter and much more flavorful. I would recommend waiting for them to come to room temperature before eating. The texture is much better when they've warmed up a bit. Also, I'd recommend avoiding the salted caramel and lemon flavors. Portabello fries are a cool concept. Unfortunately a little bland without the dipping sauce. They are also $10 ummmm what? Fried calamari is nothing interesting. Clams linguini is terrible. At $16, it's not that pricey, but the portion is tiny. Luckily, the pasta tasted so bad that I had enough leftovers to take home. Just kidding, I did not take that shit home. Did they forget to salt the pasta and flavor the sauce? I mentioned this to the waiter and she was very nice about it. New York Strip steak is delicious ($35). Fries on the side are soggy and unsalted. Ceppo gamber pasta ($16) is good but not great. The pasta itself is a little doughy. I don't even need to taste the rest of the pastas to know that they are mediocre. Creme brulee is tasty ($9) - rich but not overly so. All their desserts have cute presentations. The waitstaff is attractive. Somehow not one of the 9 people at our table ordered a pizza. How did that happen? I suspect that the only good things at this establishment are the pizza and the sweets.  To this I shake my head. Is there something wrong with having every item on your menu taste fabulous? Also, our group waited a good 1 hour and 15 minutes before getting seated. I'll be honest: I think the no reservations policy is stupid. I could have been doing so many other things with one hour and fifteen minutes of time. You advertise yourself as an upscale restaurant, so please offer upscale services. tl;dr: not impressed, won't be back.

This place is located in downtown L.A.. The place is very busy, crowded, and loud. Even though the place was busy we still received great service. The staff was friendly and very attentive. We were a party of ten so that was amazing. The favorites would be the Portabello Fries and the Lasagna which had the best Bolognese meat ragu and the creamiest Buffalo Mozzarella. They also have a very delicious Creme Brulee. Yummy! Next visit one box of Pistachio Macarons!

Damn these macarons are good! When you walk into this restaurant/pastisserie you see compete beauty and elegance! You walk right into their  display of macarons. It is absolutely gorgeous except for one thing,,,,,the massively high ceilings resulting in a high level of noise from poor acoustics. Other than that you are immediately taken away by the beautiful macaroons perfectly laid out in the display. They are ALL tasty. At $2 each you can try all of them! My favorites were the dark chocolate ganache, rose, earl grey tea and of course salted caramel. Anything salted caramel is good! I have never had lunch or dinner here and probably won't but I will be back for more of these crack macarons!

With all the great reviews, I had high expectations, but was disappointed. Here's the breakdown of my brunch experience: 2 stars for the food- lobster hash was bland. We also tried the portobello fries, which was only saved by the aioli sauce. I have no idea why everyone raves about it. 3 stars for the macarons- I can never pass these up and these were yummy, but not the best I ever had. I prefer the ones at 'Lette.   4 stars for the service- despite the 40 minute wait, everyone was friendly and busting a move in there. Maybe they had an off day in the kitchen, but I won't be rushing back for more anytime soon.

Lovely. I'm a sucker for bright white rooms and gold accents and pretty food. Polite service, and our treats and coffee were wonderful. For sure worth a try &...and worth revisiting. The only downside: The atmosphere outside is not nearly as posh. I get that a big beautiful building is cheaper in DTLA than in Beverly Hills or Santa Monica....but the block Bottega is on is busy, and a little "shady" - it leaves something to be desired, but I suppose it is a part of their charm. a gem amongst the mean streets. I still think they should franchise? Or at least open up other cafes throughout "higher-end" areas of LA   . . . Please?

Went here for my 2 year anniversary with my boyfriend. My hair stylist recommended this place so I decided I would give it a try since I was in the area. Parking is whatever. It's in Downtown LA so you can't expect it to have its own parking lot. We parked two blocks down in a private lot and walked (no biggie). The place is beautiful. White walls surround this HUGE restaurant. I ordered the calamari, portabello fries, and pizza. Calamari was cooked to perfection! The dipping sauce it came with was sooooo good! Def not your ordinary tartar sauce! Portabello fries were okay... I wanted to try them cause everyone raves about them but for some reason, ours tasted bland. Our pizza was huge! I split it with my boyfriend and we STILL couldn't finish it! For dessert, we had the Grand Macaron and it was pretty good! The reason for the 3 stars was the service. Everyone around us had really attentive waiters/waitresses but for some reason, I only saw our waiter twice! Once to take our order and again to bring our check! We had someone else bring us our food and refill our water. That was a disappointment. ALSO, we were seated by some snot nose hostess who walked us to our table with an attitude... Not good! Overall, I won't be back because service is everything to me.

I came here w/ the bf late night because we were hungry and it was just right around the corner from our downtown LA hotel. one side of the restaurant were where all the pastries were being sold at...from fancy mini cakes/ pies/ MACARONS.--yes. the other side was the restaurant. We waited about 15 minutes. We shared a burger with fries (which was a good portion for two) and PORTOBELLO FRIES. You must get the Portobello Fries! Our waiter was very attentive. Great place to eat for late night!

I visit here often for lunches with clients, quick bites, and better yet it's a great place to gather with friends for wine, macarons, desserts, and laughter. The laughter carries through the room.

This place is very trendy with high ceilings, sophisticated diners, and a beautiful bakery that can rival any place in Paris or New York.

A bunch of my friends and I decided to eat at Bottega Louie after walking aimlessly at the DTLA artwalk.  For a party of 9 they seated us within 5 minutes in a packed house at 9:30 pm which I found quite impressive.  I have heard such great things about this place that I was very happy to have my friends in company to dine here. The service was awesome.  The location is a bit seedy at night (but it's DTLA, you expect that, right?).  The staff is very attentive.  The food was delicious. I had the trenne which was pan sautéed trenne pasta with braised prime rib eye, Tuscan black kale & shaved Grana parmesan.  I don't know if the definition of trenne is crunchy, over-baked triangular shaped penne, but the pasta could have been better.  I did love the braised prime rib eye so I didn't complain.  I had a sip of my bf's raspberry Italian soda and a taste of a friend's creme brulee; both were heavenly!   I'll come back and try something that doesn't have crunch pasta, maybe the next time around I'll become a fan.  3.33 stars.

Wow...a very grand restaurant indeed. Upon entry you are amazed by the beautiful and colorful display of macarons and assorted baked goods. I was there for lunch but it took a minute for my boyfriend to finally steer me away from the sugary treats with promises that he'll get me what I want later. This place is definitely legit. White walls, high ceilings and staff that really take their job seriously.  I saw waiters with perfectly coif hair, wrinkle free white shirts under a lintless black vest. The restaurant is rather big but the tables are put very close together so you sit in very close proximity of other patrons. After scanning the menu and the dishes that were brought out to other patrons, we got the diver scallops, the club sandwich, the portobello fries and the duck prosciutto crostini. I thought everything was really good especially the juicy scallops and the portobello fries. Make sure to ask for extra sauce if you get the fries!! Pure fattening heaven! My BF didn't really care for the duck prosciutto crostini because he said it was tangy. If you like balsamic vinegar then you'll like it like I do. Only thing I can say that I didn't like was that it was so NOISY! My BF sat two feet in front of me but I can barely hear him. We were there during the crazy lunch rush though. Definitely would like to try their breakfast next time in LA. BTW... the salted caramel macaron is the best I've ever had.

Disclaimer: My friend bought macarons and I will try them tomorrow and update this review once that has happened.  This review is based simply on cost to benefit for their desserts. Great decor and the display of macarons were impressive.  Unfortunately I only bought a chocolate bar for $8 and shared it with my friends.  It was milk chocolate but it was delicious and melted in my mouth and in my hands.  It was pricey but I had to try something from this beautiful store.  Wish I had gotten the toffee with dark chocolate instead.   Overall: Everything was pricey but the presentation is a notch above.  Not the best value but worth trying if you're in Los Angeles.

No. Bottega Louie.. you are totally overrated. ok yeah its pretty awesome that you have every color/flavor macaroon and your desserts are pretty jawdropping, but other than that.. take your stuck up hostess' out of there, and maybe I'll want to actually sit. My friend wouldn't sit down with me because your hostess was so rude. The other time I went the waiter was so in my face and needy of approval it was overwhelming, and therefore tough to enjoy my very so-so burrata pizza.  My friend thought your club was really just ok for what he had to pay too. I believe you have what it takes to be pretty awesome, but please fine tune before you get so cocky.

Finally got to try this place! It lived up to most of my expectations. The only reason why I didn't give it five stars was because of their service. Since it was pretty hectic (weekend brunch) and noisy, service was on the slow side. However food and ambience was amazing. Super trendy and totally an LA experience. Tried the Portobello fries since every review raved it and it was pretty mind blowing. If you don't like deep fried things with too much flour you may not be a fan FYI. The sausage pizza was the best-totally ordering this again! Waffle was slightly on the burnt side to me but their fruits were really fresh. Would totally recommend their green tea mojito!

Yes I know this place has a crazy amount of reviews already, here it is: Came here for a birthday dinner. We were running late of course and didnt get there until about 20 minutes before closing. The hostess was very gracious and sat us immediately after everyone in our party arrived yes some people were later than the birthday girl maybe ten minutes or so. I shared the mushroom pizza with my sister and had a taste of everyone's dinner. Everything was tasty. Portobello fries are awesome! Totally coming back for the macarons!

Lunch was great, the Macarons were awesome.  I liked the ambience, service, and the open kitchen was fun to see.  Portobello fries were tasty and the dish I remembered the most.  Had some pizza and a burger.  They were great, but for the price I expected a little more.   You pay for 2 hour parking adjacent to the restaurant, which was enough time for us order, eat, and browse the bakery.   I definitely do need to go back and indulge more on the menu, maybe for dinner. 5 stars for the macarons 4 stars for the food.

Went here for a friend's birthday. There was about 10 of us, so maybe that played a factor. The waiter poured water sloppily and it kind of splashed over everyone. Food took about an hour to get to us (with the exception of an ashy pizza that came within 30 minutes). I nibbled on my friend's burnt crust for sustenance. We got a bitch attitude from the waiter when we inquired about the ridiculous wait for food. When the food came out... bland and over cooked. What did we order? Some chicken or pasta? Among the shared dishes, nothing stood out to me. It was insufficient in quality and quantity. Bleh. I'd spent better money before on a can of Chef Boyardee. As for our waiter, I think among my table, I was the only one with the heart to leave tip. One positive thing... it was clean. Maybe this was just one isolated shitacular experience since most everyone else loves it. But there's so much out there in LA that's a thousand times better, so I'm steering clear of this one unless someone drags me here while I'm unconscious.

This place is truly, truly impressive. Of course I can only speak for the baked goodies and the ready to buy section but I think anyone walking into Bottega Louie would be hard pressed not to be extremely impressed by the sheer size and selection of this place. I passed by this location a day before I came in as I didn't know about Bottega Louie at all and was definitely confused why there were SO many people lined up outside. A quick look on Yelp told me everything I needed to know about how great this place was. Furthermore, while at Daikokuya ramen in LA, I also discovered that Bottega was the NUMBER ONE restaurant on Yelp in 2011! Of course I had to go. We didn't have time for a sit and eat but I am a huge pastries fan and usually haul home a hefty stash when I visit LA so I was pretty determined to clean house when I got to Louie. You walk into the ready made section first where there are brightly colored macarons immediately staring at you in the face. They sell a macaron tree of 125 macacrons for $275! Further down, you will find delightful candies, chocolates, cakes, tarts etc. and at the very end you will find their amazing selection of breads including epi bread!! As you can imagine, I was beside myself. I had to exercise extreme extreme restraint from taking home like $100 of pastries and limited myself to a few items and their macarons. The plain beignet was AWESOME. My thighs thank you very much Bottega Louie. You have made me a happy, happy girl. On another note, they also have a great food / kitchen area where they serve their infamous soufflé. I definitely have to try that next time.

Beautiful place next to not-so beautiful area in LA. Bottega located in downtown LA. Never thought this level of restaurant would be here in LA, not in downtown or even other parts of LA! When I walked in to the restaurant, the place was packed. Beautiful people were eating, waiting, all over the Bottega. Never seen this kind of crowd anywhere in LA.   I felt like I was in Paris, or somewhere in Europe. Beautiful macarons, eclairs and other goodies laying pretty inside of glass cases. We waited maybe 30 minutes or so. Beautiful hostess brought us to a round table. Two rechtanglular white  papers were on top of the table. A bread guy brought a Zopf type of bread on the table. Not on a plate. I took a part of bread with my hand, added butter. Wow, that was good. The bread sold me! I love this place. I had prosciutto something. Prosciutto was a bit thick side though it tasted excellent. Salmon millefeuille  looked beautiful and tasted good. Coffee was good. Service was nice and prompt. Nothing to complain in Bottega. You just want stay longer, though you see tons of beautiful people waiting patiently... Again, Bottega is a beautiful place to have breakfast or lunch with your beautiful friends or family..Good thing is you don't have to fly to go to Bottega. You just drive to LA downtown though you feel like you are in Paris or...

Yea so I bought into the hype about these "macaroon" " macarones", w/e you decide they are called. Friend of mine brought me in for some dessert- you know it. I will be back here for dinner next time, incredible. I grabbed a sea salt and caramel mac- so good. I also tried her choc macaroon which was afloat a lava cake surrounded by berries- yea ok that was better than mine I'll admit. She was slightly more seasoned at ordering here than I, but I will soon catch on. I also ordered this indescribable mousse and raspberry filled rectangular red, thing? Yes the name has escaped me, but theres a picture of it I've posted. Brb... The "revisit" 8.26.12 - Portebello fries - Shrimp pasta - Pizza: half artichoke/half shroom (do it, stat) - Broccoli Rabe - Choc soufle - Butterscotch Budino (Best of the desserts) - Strawberry shortcake - Beignests with raspberry sauce - 5 set of macaroons (strawberry, pistachio, sea salt n cara, lemon, and dark choc) 4.5 stars for the meal, quality service, and being seated within seconds of arrival for an important occasion by the fire pit- awesome.

We didn't eat dinner here but the Macaroons were exceptional.  I am not a macaroon fan but I thoroughly enjoyed them.  I had the Salted Caramel, Chocolate Orange and the Expresso.  The Salted Caramel flavor was my fave.  Also had the a slice of cheesecake and a chocolate bar too.  Also, sinfully rich and delicious!

Good Italian restaurant in the middle of downtown.  This place is in an old bank building so the stone walls and hard lid make the restaurant extremely loud... Definitely not a good place if you're there to catch up with a friend you haven't seen in a while.. All of their small dishes are reasonably priced... love their fennel sausage with beans.. not too crazy about the portobello mushroom fries... their diver scallop dish is made perfectly.. i prefer their pizza over Mozza... the crust here is done nicely with the balance of the chewiness and crispiness done right.. nice refreshing salads.. burrata with fresh tomatoes, basil and balsalmic vinaigrette... Not too impressed with the meat dishes.. the lasagna was a little salty but definitely better than most places.. Best part of the meal is the dessert... Don't order the Panna Cotta... it is definitely too hard.. Their Grand Macaron reminds me of the Divin that they have at Laduree in Paris.. their peanut butter chocolate bar is pretty decadent but I heard that they toned it down since their original was like 1500 calories.. Their chocolate souffle... speechless.. takes a while so make sure you order it early but it was great.. the texture was perfect... crisp outer shell and the moist light inside of the souffle was so good, we would have ordered another one if we weren't in a rush to get somewhere else.. Try to kick the pizza cravings at other places, but definitely have to come here to make that craving go away.. for what you get, the price is definitely right.. for the people complaining about the price, stick to Olive Garden and CPK..

I had been looking forward to trying out Bottega Louie for a long time, and I definitely plan to return to check it out again. I went with my boyfriend on a weekend night so the entire restaurant was packed - we had a small wait but were able to get a table for 2 within 10-15 minutes which wasn't bad at all. My favorite thing about Botegga Louie also happens to be my least favorite thing: the interior. The space is huge and open with extremely high ceilings but because of that the noise level is off the charts, much louder than a bar. I've never eaten in such a noisy restaurant before -- I had to lean in and shout each time I wanted to speak to my boyfriend which kind of ruined the dining experience. I was also worried that the server hadn't been able to hear our order and would bring out the wrong thing. The open setup, however, is pretty unique because you can watch all the chefs cooking in the kitchen space. Service was great, food came out fairly quickly considering how many people were there. We got a pizza and prosecco, both of which were very good. I'd like to come back again, maybe on a weekday, and hopefully the noise level won't be as loud so I can enjoy the experience more.

I visited Bottega Louie on a Sunday night, but the place was still packed. While waiting for our table we tried out a few drinks at the bar. The bartenders were knowledgeable and they had a nice selection on the back bar to work with.   Once seated our server was amazing. She gave us good suggestions and was on top of things throughout the entire meal. The scallops were amazing as was the pizza we selected. Of the drinks we had, my personal favorite was the Champs Elysees was my favorite but then again I am a sucker for green Charteuse.

Came here last night with a group of friend...I have to say the number of STARS has gone wayyyy downnnnn. The service was overall great but the food was BLEH. Honestly, people are either here for DESSERTS (souffle) OR the DECO. Still unsure why this place is still so packed everyday of the week. Parking: $6 valet parking right next to the restaurant. If you want to SAVE MONEY, the lot across the street is even cheaper but a BIT FURTHER WALK and it is not VALET. Ordered   ***PANZELLA SALAD $10: toasted house made ciabatta, tomato, persian cucumbers,basil and creamy red wine vinegarette dressing: first of all this sald dish is super hard to dish since the LETTUCE LEAVES were so large!! not the best way to serve salad. The dressing was just right for the amount of salad. Wouldn't recommend this dish. ***BURRATA PIZZA $20: The pizza is topped with BURRATA, parmasan, rapini, garlic, extra virgin olive oil and prosciutto slices. the pizza is pretty large, serves about 2-3 people depending on how many slices you can consume. For those of you who wonder what RAPINI is ...it is commonly known in the United States as broccoli raab (also spelled broccoli rabe) and belong in the mustard family. So it has a kick of horseradish taste, can be quiet intense if you dislike the "wasabi" sensation. Again not my fav ***CLAM LINGUINI: $16 white wine, clams, shallots, garlic, Italian parsley, with linguini. SERIOUSLY not worth ordering!!! The pasta is not the homemade type of pasta so you can basically mimic this same pasta at home by pouring in some olive oil, clam, white wine, and seafood stock. Wasn't impressed at all. ***PORTEBELLO FRIES: $10 Not the best fried mushroom i've ever had. Typically you would expect the mushroom to be a bit more juicy after you fry it but you won't get that JUICINESS in this dish. Very disappointing. ***FRIED CALAMARI: $12: VERY TYPICAL Nothing impressive. I don't think its hard to mess this one up since its just fried calamari served with red sauce. *** CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE: THIS IS THE BEST DISH OF THE NIGHT. Don't expect a chocolate lava cake texture because there's no lava inside this souffle. They serve this dish with a cream which perfects the fluffiness of this souffle. MUST ORDER IN ADVANCE or else you would probably have to wait forever. OVERALL: AGAIN ANOTHER DISAPPOINTING EXPERIENCE. Not sure if I would ever come back here again if it wasn't for friends. I personally would not recommend this to any of my foodie friends.

Like my review matters given the 4,500+ others, but still... The wife and I stopped in for brunch yesterday before hopping on the Expo Line to the coliseum to watch my alma mater whip her alma mater on the gridiron. I figured I best get the wife well-fed to keep her from getting too cranky about her Bears' ineptituude on the football field. We arrived at Bottega Louie at around 12:15 pm, and had about a 15 minute wait for our table. No biggie - we just went over and oggled the desserts. The wife bought a five pack of macarons to sneak into the coliseum, and I got an incredible strawberry thing to eat after brunch (sorry, forgot the name - it looks like strawberry shortcake). I don't like macarons, but the wife thought that hers were among the best she's ever had, rivaling Bouchon in Yountville. For brunch, I had the lobster hash and she had the burrata scramble. The lobster hash contains some serious chunks of lobster tail, and the smoked paprika hollandaise is just incredible. I soaked up every last drop with the amazing bread. As for my wife's, the burrata was excellent but the eggs were a teeny bit cold. We drank the free sparkling water, but the cocktails looked good. All in all, I'm thinking 4.75 stars but I'll round up. I hope we make it back for a regular lunch or dinner soon - the pizzas looked fantastic.

Was just here on Wednesday and upon entering I was in love with macaron display and the design of the restaurant. But immediately lost interest when management did not want to sit our large party) together in a booth, so instead we opted for a bunch of little tables lined up together. Our waiter was very friendly until he began to talk "ghetto" because we were black. He did this the entire dinner service. It wasn't funny and some of the girls found it very offensive. The food was OK at best. we sent a few plates back due to it being over or undercooked. The lasagna was terrible. The lamb chops are OK, I've had better at the former Cafe Entourage's all in all I will not be returning

Love at first sight! As soon as I stepped foot inside I was already a fan. I was greeted by several friendly faces behind the counter immediately and overwhelmed by excitement with all the bright and colorful macrons, cakes and pretty little boxes. Although the macrons were a little pricey they tasted like a piece of heaven. I can't wait to go back for dinner.

Been going here for the past two years and it seems like my experience is getting better over time. The building itself is in the corner so it's easy to find. Inside is very open with high ceiling and fancy decor. Once you enter the premises you will be greeted by DELICIOUS DESSERTS that will not leave your mind alone for the entire dinner. Beautiful presentation and great taste is hard to find all in one place, but they've got it here with their desserts! Cute packaging also, perfect for a 'just because' gift (: Must try their portabello fries and go home with A LOT of macarons :) Absolutely LOVE their rose macarons, probably the best one I've had out of all the macaron places I've tried. Will leave you wanting more, that's for sure! Great place for a girls' night out or a simple date night with the significant others. Very young crowd most the time, wouldn't recommend family dinners here. For big parties please keep in mind, everyone in the party must be present to be seated! So make sure your friends don't lag, otherwise, you'd be standing around and ending up buying a bunch of desserts before dinner.......guilty :X

If someone is visiting downtown LA this is the no-brainer place to take them.  The pizza is suspiciously delicious (they'll make it however you want -- crispy, light cheese, whatever) and the drinks solid.   Pizza -- try the margherita or artichoke!!! Old Fashioned -- was even better at Bottega than it was across the street at Seven Grand (a legitimate whiskey bar).  They also have a list of specials.  Try something weird! Calamari - lightly fried and tasty tasty tasty. Portobello fries -- big portion of delectable, crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside Portobello tastinees. No reservations -- you have to put your name in when you arrive.  Be prepared to wait a while in peak hours.  The place gets packed.   Service -- invariably friendly and attentive.   Parmesan pretzels -- if my girlfriend is ever mad at me, I know what to do.  She claims these are the best pretzels she's ever had.  Get one from the bakery stand, take it home and throw it in the toaster oven.  Holy crap.   To go meals -- you can pick up prepackaged sandwiches and salads and whatnot.  I am told they are delicious. Bakery -- they also have a smorgasbord of fancy looking and commensurately expensive sweets (e.g., macaroons, square pastel  marshmallows).

I don't know what I could add to the 4000+ reviews that hasn't been said yet, so I'll just keep it short. Bottega Louie easily is 5-stars because their service was fast and attentive, love the high ceilings and modern look, they have a bar, macarons galore, and desserts for days. I came here for brunch with a girlfriend and we had bellinis and mimosas. Food is reasonably priced and delicIous. We shared a pizza and got the Portobello fries as they were highly recommended on Yelp. I enjoyed them, especially with the sauce it comes with. As far as macarons go, my favorite was the vanilla and earl grey. Pretty pricey macarons, but I don't know any other place that has cheap macarons. I'll definitely come back here when I'm in the LA area again.

Bottega louie reminds me of pinks hot dog. Somehow many people go but the food is not so impressive. The difference though is that you are paying way more money than pinks. But I want to give some credit to the restaurant. Its interior is nice (even though high ceiling makes the place very loud) and the service is good. If you want to take your date or significant others to somewhere nice, this can be a place but only if you don't mind so much about mediocre quality of the food. Ps: I hate yelpers who think they are qualified food critics and I try not to be so anal about food evaluation when I rate restaurants but I cannot help thinking the food in LA is so overrated and so overpriced if it is a half way decent. This place is unfortunately one of those restaurants.

Do you remember Willy Wonka??? Well...this restaurant has extraordinary desserts fulfilled mostly by macaroons in various flavors, beignets, favorite dinner desserts. Walking inside was like walking into a candy store. The extravagant colors and design definitely holds a sense of upper class status. Of course this restaurant is very popular, so the line could be frustrating. We went on a Saturday before 3 pm and noticed that they serve brunch...I emphasized 3 pm because afterwards they would give you the dinner menu instead. Bad thing was that we were there at 1:30 pm, we wanted to taste their dinner not brunch. What we ordered was roasted potatoes and an egg white omelet. The roasted potatoes was very crispy and had loads of flavor! Better than your average French fries. I would definitely recommend this side dish. The egg white omelet had red bell peppers, cherry tomatoes and spinach. The combination was phenomenal, the flavors just exploded in your mouth and had the urgency to put more...very addicting. The little side salad was light and terrific. Service here was spectacular! Very attentive and friendly. They were helpful in helping us order some of the dishes, since we were newbies. Overall, I would definitely recommend coming here. However, I can't give them five stars until I taste their dinner...sounds fair right? =] Note: They give you free sparkling or plain water. I would suggest plain water...the sparkling water wasn't that great...

Great food and ambiance!   Kisses: Portobello Mushroom Fries - a must side!  Long chunks of mushrooms deep fried and battered with a yummy aioli sauce! Trenne pasta with short ribs - the meat is tender and the trenne pasta is al dente and tastes almost like it was pan fried - very interesting and yummy take on pasta I've had quite a few of the pizzas and they are all yummy thin-crust Italian style pizzas. Bar area where you can order a drink while you wait and they have a wide selection of desserts, pastries and international fare in their cute marketplace. Disses: Macaroons - since having the "real" ones in Paris, these are a bit too crispy and do not melt in your mouth Don't take reservations so plan to arrive early and wait.   Sketchy area of downtown LA but there's a parking lot next door and they do have valet so you can be in and out if you don't want to stick around!

This is the kind of place where you can expect solid food every time and finish it off with a good dessert. There are just a few things though they could do a little better. For example, the portabella mushroom fries were amazing and possibly the best thing on the menu. Perfectly crisp but still juicy and cooked on the inside. However, the basil aioli dipping sauce it came with didn't taste like much and just seemed overly thick and greasy. The homemade orechiette with sausage, olive oil, and broccoli rabe, tasted just like homemade orechiette with sausage, olive oil, and broccoli rabe. Nothing more and nothing really special. The macarons too are good, just not really wow. There are no real wow flavors on the menu. The flavors are kind of like the interior of the restaurant. It's a great space with hugely high ceilings and the potential for grandiosity, but they didn't bother putting any artwork on the walls so it's just plain white space. Like vanilla ice cream with nothing in it.   They'll get you in and out, fed and satisfied in a fairly short amount of time. It just won't quite make you linger for more.

Two words can describe this place: 1. White 2. Macarons I actually think this restaurant is kind of cool because it's just one giant room (no real walls) so the front door and back entrance are within one line of sight. However, this just means that it'll be SUPER noisy during lunch and dinner times, which it was. Ideal for large parties but not ideal for intimate dates, Bottega Louie is sub-par compared to other Los Angeles restaurants which can accomodate for both. -Portobello fries- these were really good! They were so good, in fact, that they were the best part of our entire meal... sad. Crispy with a soft interior, the mushroom flavor paired well with the assortment of sauces they provided. Also, it being fried mushroom always makes me feel healthier about eating 'fries' ;) -Macarons- YUM! At the front of the restaurant, they have a beautiful display of baked goods including a giant display of macarons in every pastel color a girl can imagine :) Before you buy them though, you should know-- yes, macarons are expensive and no, this place doesn't inflate the prices THAT much. If you ask nicely, they'll give you a pretty box even when you didn't buy the packaged ones. -All the other food that we ate was unmemorable... I don't think you should come to this restaurant expecting a good meal. It's really just a place for baked goods :)

For me, Bottega Louie's only getting stars for their macarons - I've been here twice, and I am only coming back for the delightful desserts :o My favorite was definitely SALTED CARAMEL, although rose and coffee are also superb. My roomie likes the Earl Grey, which is a really cool shade of blue with gold flecks. As for the food, I was disappointed both times I was here :( Salads are ordinary and bland, pizzas are decent but nothing special, and pastas are a noooooo. Their clam linguini = dry noodles + soggy boring clams. Come, but don't venture any farther than the pretty glass cases of macarons + sweets. :)

This was probably the easiest five-star-er reviews I've had to give.  This is one of my favorite spots in LA, or perhaps, anywhere in Southern California.   No reservations.  So depending on when you show up, you may be waiting about 30 minutes to 1 hour for a table.  Although, i've also heard that you might also wait up to 1.5 hours for a table on a busy friday or saturday night. but i've never had to wait that long.   I just love the interior design of Bottega Louie.  I know everyone mentions the tall ceilings.  and well, i'm gonna mention them too.  I love the "hall" type of setting inside.  It's loud, but you can actually still hear your friends talking to you.  it's almost like a huge water fountain filtering out the sounds in a sort of weird effective way.  I especially love the completely open kitchen that's located at the center of the establishment.   I haven't had one bad dish here at Bottega Louie.  From breakfast, to lunch, and to dinner.  The food is very good and everything is reasonably priced.  You're not going to break the bank or empty the wallet here.   And of course, every time I show up here, I can't leave without getting some freshly made macaroons.  I always walk out of here with at least a box of 5 mac's.  The packaging of all the desserts is just sick. I love it.  It all looks very elegant and high quality.   My only complaint is that I wish there was a Bottega Louie that was 5 minutes from where I live.  Unfortunately, it's 45 minutes away in Downtown LA.  But the visit is always worth it.   An easy 5 star rating.

Decided to have brunch in LA this past Sunday and since everyone has been talking about this place i just had to see what it was all about. Obviously you HAVE to get the macaroons because that is what they are known for and they are absolutely DELISH! :) I heard that the pistachio, early grey and salted carmel are the most popular and they are right! For our meal we ordered a pizza (the artichoke and added sausages onto it) and an order of the eggs benedict with the smoked salmon to share among the both of us. When we got there, there was a bit of a wait, about 30 mins or so, so we decided to grab some mimosa. To be honest i was a little disappointed because the bartender didnt even pour us a full cup. it was barely half and for just that little glass of a mimosa it was 12 dollars. talk about RIP OFF. :(( but then again you have to put into consideration that this place is one of those high-end dinning spots. But still doesnt mean you can be cheap about it! :O Anywaysssss... other than that, the food was great! Oh and make sure if you like bubble alcoholic drinks, to get the French 75. It's yummy! but also dont expect for it to be a lot for the price that you are paying. -_- At the end our bill came out to 80 with tip. Not too bad, but it's still a bit pricey. I have to add though, I really liked the decor of the restaurant. It felt like i was dinning at a restaurant in New York, a mini escape. haha ***Also if you are looking for parking, there is a lot that is right next to it on grand, it's 5 dollars during the weekends to park there

An extremely well thought out restaurant concept which shows in their success.  Everything from the design of the restaurant to the open kitchen concept to the demeanor of the staff.  I don't throw out five stars to just anyone, being the self proclaimed reviewer that I am of many a eatery.   I am in all kinds of love with Bottega Louie.  I came here one Saturday morning expecting a long wait for brunch, the host promptly greeted us and another host sat us immediatly.  Hosts rocking three piece suits, love it, I'm a sucker for any man in a tailored suit anyways.   Onto the food now, that's really what the review is all about.  I ordered the eggs benedict.  I must say I almost had a mouthgasm.  This was the best eggs benedict that I have ever had and I will attest to that all day and night.  The macaroons are a must try, they have boxes of five for $10, I wish I would have gotten the larger box as I am nearly out of these delectable treats. I can leave the sweets alone and go with food any day of the week, I would rather have food than sweet treats, but that's not the case with B.L. I want both, I want them all. Their pastries are an artform as their pastry chef(s) have carved out a niche with flavors reminiscent of France. Downtown L.A. don't hesitate to stop in, grab a table, sit, eat, enjoy.

Great place for good food if you don't mind the loud ambiance!   Yes, it's big, it's white, the flowers are great, but the FOOD is amazing!   The duck prociutto crostini and the mussels are delishes!  The macaroons perfect and the fish, meat and pasta paired with wine are some of the yummiest!   Go, take your friends, family and your ear plugs!

Tried Bottega Louie for the first time this week. Love the environment and the food. Drinks are pretty good! It's very well balanced, not too sweet and not too strong. It's the perfect amount of alcohol. The Portobello Fries are sooo good! I also love the Beef Capriccio there!!! The Lobster Soup is very flavorful, but a bit on the saltier side. The pastas are alright... But overall, I really enjoyed my experience here :)

I was curious about what the hype was all about so my big sis and I went to check this place out because we haven't seen each other in a while. When we first got seated, I enjoyed how this place offered a complimentary bottle of water. Things were going well and I really liked the decor, but I looked at the menu and my jaw dropped. The prices were ridiculous and I know plenty of places where the food is worth its money. I checked on yelp which food is good and so we got the trenne pasta and the portobello fries. The food also took a very long time even though it was just two dishes. The trenne pasta was too difficult to eat as I didn't expect the pasta to be crunchy. The flavor was fine, but the texture was a huge let down. The portobello fries were really good especially since I love mushrooms. Mushroom + fries? DOWN. So far Bottega Louie did not leave a great impression, but I guess next time, I would like to try the smoked salmon and pizza. Maybe by then, I will change the yelp review. The line for the macaroons was very disorganized. I had no clue where the line started and just aimlessly went into the crowd hoping that someone will help me. I do like the macaroons here, but it's not to die for. I wouldn't mind going to Lette in Old Town Pasadena and get my macaroons than spend my time finding parking in Downtown LA. Overall, I think this place is too hyped up so my expectation was disappointment.

Oh Botega Louie, I am glad you live in DTLA so I am not tempted by you on a daily basis. As soon as I entered I noticed your bars full of pastries and chocolate delights.  I put my name down and stood amongst the commotion... There seemed to be hundreds of people filling your well decorated, European inspired space. I went to the bar and ordered a pink lemonade and thought my taste buds were going to burst with delight. I sat by the window and marveled at the impressive white marble floors that the servers seemed almost to float above. I ordered the most simple breakfast and it was amazing. Eggs served with both bacon and turkey sausage and fabulous roasted red potatoes. I got the bill and tried to make my way out but the macaroons pulled me back in. I enjoyed every sinful bite. You put quite a dent in the pocket book and if I lived near you I would whore myself out to pay for those macaroons.... Oh those macaroons..

Second time there and this time not so enamored. Conclusion: some dishes great, some mediocre at best.  Had the pizza - quite good but not great. Friends had salads and declared them good, not great.  Fried portabellos looked way better than they tasted - they really needed something more than the dab of aioli provided.  Salt and pepper helped, but in the end, it is a batter-fried mushroom on steriods.  Service good but again, not great.  The ambience, although some people like the frenetic, crowded noise, is awful for any kind of conversation.  That would be somewhat offset if the food were so damned delicious you didn't care to talk anyway.  Won't be returning for a meal, but maybe the bakery.

Went back here on a random Sunday night when BF was craving Macarons and I was craving Bottega's cupcake! Went on Yelp and found out this place closes at 11 pm on a Sunday night, SCORE! This is one of the most random nights, when you're just sitting around doing nothing and all of a sudden, a mission to get some sugar! haha! We got there and the line was pretty short! BF wanted to get the of 13 for $26, I just wanted a cupcake for $2.50. I got my cupcake, it was a good thing they didn't have the rose cupcake because I would have gotten it again and I really wanted to try something different. They only had Vanilla, Pistacio and Violet Cassis, so I decided to try the Violet Cassis and it was sooooo YUMMY! but I don't think I can eat all the frosting on top, it's good ; but oh so sweet! Macarons (last time we had the salted caramel, Earl Grey, Raspberry, Rose and strawberry) BF got 13, so we got the 5 like last time plus 8 more: -Vanilla: One of my favs, it was so yummy, tasted like vanilla bean ice cream! -Chocolate Orange: Not so my favorite -Grand Cru: Not a fan of dark chocolate -Expresso: I thought i was going to hate it, but it was actually good! -Pistachio: Another fav, YUMMY! -Violet Cassis: Eh, not as great as the cupcake. -Matcha: YUM! Green Tea! -Passion: Also yummy! Passion Fruit flavored desserts are usually good! The only one we haven't tried is the Lemon, we didn't get it because we both don't like lemon flavored desserts, but I think we should have gotten it.. Oh well... Oh, shall I add...after eating a few macarons and a cupcake, I was seriously on a SUGAR HIGH, I could not stop laughing for the life of me! haha!!

So we went here for my sister's birthday and it was my first time. It's really loud in the restaurant so you kind of need to talk loud to the people at your table. However, it's really pretty inside the restaurant. It's an open kitchen so you can see the chefs making your food which is really nice. Our server was VERY helpful. She was very friendly and answered any questions we had about the menu. Now the food. For appetizers we got the portebello fries, YUM, fried calamari, and beet salad which were all delicious. For my entree I got the Trenne pasta which was very tasty. The texture is interesting because the pasta is crispy, which is something I have never tried before. I got a taste of m  sister's short rib and it was melt in your mouth delicious. You didn't even need a knife to cut into it because it was so tender. Usually I don't like polenta, but the white polenta with the short ribs was really tasty. I also got a taste of my cousin's rib eye and you could never go wrong with rib eye. And last but not least, for dessert we had the chocolate souffle. So light and good, not overly sweet but just the right amount of chocolate flavor. However, when we walked over to the bakery for some macarons to bring home, the service was TERRIBLE. First of all, we ordered the box of 13 and asked for one of each flavor. So how come I got 2 of one flavor and didn't even get the Earl Grey which I even mentioned to the cashier. Second, thanks for just handing us a box without a bag, and when we ask for a bag, you give us attitude about it. I understand the bakery was closing up, but when you see TWO other customers in front of you get better service than you, it is VERY DISAPPOINTING. It's very sad that our server in the restaurant was so good and we received great service and you walk over to the bakery and get the complete opposite experience. The macarons are delicious, but I wish we would have received better service.

Came by to try out LA's most popular restaurant according to Yelp. Located in Downtown LA, parking is either on the street, in a paid lot, or Valet for $6. ...opted to park in a private lot for $3 flat rate a couple blocks down. Upon arrival, I was greeted with a plethora of sweets and baked goods. There a few dozen "cafe-style" tables for the order and sit type. Checked-in with the hostess and got a real table in the restaurant. The restaurant is loud, REALLY loud with the 15+ ft ceilings. All of our dishes came out at the same time: Portebello Fries - Definitely worth the hype and a must try at $10. Portebello mushrooms battered and fried. ...simply delicious! Fried Mozzarella - Tasty when hot. A good dish, slightly pricey at $10. Sauteed Spinach - Fresh and flavorful. Plenty of garlic to bring out the spinach flavor. At $8, pricing was slightly high for tasty spinach. Trenne Pasta - A-ok at $16. The pasted is poached and then pan-fried to make this a really unique dish. Rib-Eye - $35. Rib eye was both flavorful and perfectly-cooked medium rare. Skip the fries and they weren't too special. Chocolate Souffle - $15. Save room for dessert! This dish takes 20 minutes to prepare and it's well worth the wait! Place your order when you order your meal to minimize the wait! The cream sauce was orgasmic and the souffle had a perfect mix of softness as well as crispiness! Maracons - $2 - Grab one on your way out to see what the hype is!  Slightly sweet but definitely a tasty treat! Service was top notch at this restaurant by the entire staff, including our waiter, Will. The biggest challenge for this venue: ...the really loud venue...

honestly i walked in and it was to die for beautiful....i really thought i would totally enjoy my time here....BOY WAS I WRONG ..the waiter was insanely rushed and rude , he cleared my plate in the worst way posible( he dropped some left over food in my water ...needless to say i lost my apetite for dessert). I tried some of my friends fruit tart and the fruit was a bit out of season. Honestly too expensive for the quality. Makes me terribly sad, the place itself is a girls dream.

Alas I finally dined at Bottega Louie and it pretty much lived up to the hype. Went here for dinner on a Saturday night and the place was packed but lucky me, I had a hook up (aka reservation).  My memorable highlights ... I had the Portobello fries - great concept and super delicious, next time I will order one for myself!!  Meatball Parmesan Sandwich - damn if I knew I could just get the meatball alone !!!  Also, thumbs down to the waiter for not telling us it came with fries since we ordered a side of fries separately.  Pizza was good, the crust was excellent - we decided on 1/2 Mushroom and 1/2 Napoli (Mozza good).  Our dining companions were full so dessert will have to wait but I did get some Macarons to go - good but nothing extraordinary nor mind-blowing. Anyways, I wish I lived closer to Bottega Louie - then I could go every other week.  Need to figure out how to get there for breakfast.

Granted, I just had a beer and some tiramisu Éclairs last night (not quite indicative of their products overall), but the experience was consistent with other times I have tasted Louie's desserts. The prices ranges from great value to overpriced -- it has been the place-to-be in LA for quite some time: 2700 reviews is A LOT. Their desserts were amazing: light on the stomach and easy on the buds. You can tell they use the right amounts of butter/sugar/salt. The drinks are overpriced, but they make it up with their great dessert packaging.

I've had burrata, mushroom, and clam pizza, clam linguini pasta, ceppo gamber pasta, portobello fries, and bruschetta. For dessert, I've had tiramisu and different flavors of macarons. Pizza overall is good. Stay away from their pasta dish. Pasta is unoriginal and bland. Portobello fries had too much batter. The batter really kills the subtle flavor of portobello mushroom. Bruschetta was soggy. Perhaps bake the bread a little longer? Or serve the tomato topping separately? Tiramisu is alright, stick with macarons-- especially earl grey, espresso, pistachio, and rose.

Too many choices but too little stomach space!!  Luckily, they readily offer their sweet goodies to-go, so I was able to try good variety of their offerings. At the cafe, we got the sausage and white beans.  It was excellent.  The white beans were cooked perfectly and they mixed them with some fresh greens.  The sausage was well seasoned and had a great fennel flavor.  We also shared the Frangipane tart.  It had a nice buttery crust, light almond paste, and fresh blueberries.  We also tried the green tea mojito (non-alcholic) and I wasn't a fan of that.  I couldn't really taste the green tea and it was too sweet. I also got some macarons to-go.  They were packaged beautifully, and they were delicious!  Sorry Bouchon...but I have a new favorite macaron.  The flavors are so distinct, the filling has the right amount of sweetness, and the shell is crunchy on the outside and super soft on the inside.  All their flavors are good, but the green tea and salted caramel were my favorites. Next time I want to try the pizza and also this dessert that looked like a macaron cake!

I can't believe how insanely popular this place is. When I walked in the door and saw masses of people, I was a little surprised, but then I thought about it... this place has over 4000+ reviews. Of course it's going to be packed. Duh! The restaurant is large and has high vaulted ceilings. I kinda felt like it had an art gallery vibe to it. The walls were tall and white, and all that was missing were pieces of art. Since it was my first time here, it was hard to figure out where to go since people are everywhere. My friend and I were directed to the middle where the host was and we waited in a line to put our name down. She told us the wait would be about 20 minutes and that they would come find us. Confused, since I didn't know how the hell they would find us through all those people, I didn't question her and we went to the bar. We grabbed a drink and perused the desserts while we waited. I couldn't wait any longer, so I bought a box of macarons because they looked so irresistible. Not the best I've had, but hey... they're pretty. Like the host said, they would come and find us and about 30 minutes later, some guy did. I was so curious on how they do that and he said that the host writes down a description of us so he knows what to look for. Ahhhh, that makes sense. As we sat down, we glanced at the menu and decisively started picking what we wanted to order. Our server, Aileen, was super bubbly and friendly and she helped us out and we went with the Grilled Artichoke ($10) and the Ceppo Gamber ($16). The Grilled Artichoke came out first and it was really delicious. I savored every bite of it. The cheese and whatever seasonings they put on this makes this a superior dish. The Ceppo Gamber looks really good, but I personally thought the taste was too bland. I like my pastas to be potent and flavorful and this particular one was a little too light in terms of flavor. I let Aileen know and she happily exchanged it for another dish. We decided to try the Trenne and although the pieces of prime rib were very good, I didn't care too much for the crispy pasta. Trenne reminded me of beef stew with pasta. I can't say I was really a fan of this one either. For dessert, we had the chocolate souffle and if you're a chocolate lover, which I'm not, I suggest you get it. It was a little to rich for my taste, but the sauce that I like to call "ranch," (I know it's not ranch... but it came in a gravy boat like ranch often does) makes the souffle very good. Although I can't say I cared for the pastas very much, the service was excellent. It's a little too crazy in there for me, so I'm not sure if I'll ever be back. I can't really comment on the food, but aside from the artichoke, I hope their other dishes that I didn't try are better. That dessert case though... it's so pretty, and it makes me DROOOOOOOOL. :)

We were dying for dessert so we stopped in.  We were blown away! The display cases are a delight to see. Every item is gorgeous and mouthwatering. We were running back and forth from one to the other, trying to decide what to get. It was like we were on a sugar overload and we hadn't even ordered anything yet. We finally decided on some macarons, a chocoate hazelnut filled bignet and a vanilla and berry verrine. Everything was amazing, except for the verrine. I was a bit disappointed because it was a little bland. I will return soon to try the rest of their goodies.

The desserts here are a work of art!  Service here is fast and easy.  The decision of what to get is hard.  We got a couple of desserts to go. I've been here for lunch once before and the food was actually good but all I could remember about the experience was our table of eight's conversation.  It kind of went like this..."What?"  "What did she say?"  "I don't know?  I can't hear her?"  We all couldn't wait to finish to get out of there.  The noise level in this restaurant is unbearable!  The quietest place in the restaurant is in the restroom.  Bottega Louie, take note from your neighbor Mo-Chica and also Comme Ca.  Add either a felt padding or carpet under all of your tables & chairs to absorb some of the noise.

This review is for their macarons only. (Visited Bottega in August 2012) Once I stepped foot into this bakery/restaurant, I was filled with joy. My eyes began to glisten when I saw the wide selection of gorgeous looking macarons. WIthout even trying them yet, I already knew that I was going to give this place 5 stars for the appearance of their macarons. Never have I ever seen such perfect, vibrantly colored, and sparkly macarons. And after eating my first Bottega macaron, I was even more happy and satisfied (: I ordered a box of 6, and enjoyed eating the Earl Grey, Matcha, and Strawberry. However, the texture of the Pistachio was a little hard. It was probably just that one in particular. Nevertheless, Bottega is at the top of my macarons list, right after Lette Macarons. I'm definitely coming back!

Upon reading all the yelp reviews, I have decided to give this place a shot! I wish there are 2 separate reviews for their food and pastries. For pastries, so far I have tried their creme brûlée and chocolate soufflé and I would give it a 4 star for those. However, they are super expensive. The chocolate souffle cost about $17 and the creme brulee cost around $10 ! Even though they are really good, its not worth the expenses. I  have tried those from other places with a cheaper price and same or even better quality. For their main entree, me and my friend got clam and trenne pasta. All i can say that i was really disappointed and i felt like this place was too overrated. First of all, the trenne pasta has barely any meat in there. Through all my poking and flipping of the entire pasta, there were only 3 small pieces of meat. The pasta itself was not flavorful enough and they didn't give you a lot for the price. SOme of the pasta was crispy and some was not and when you eat those together, it was not very satisfying and tasted weird. Secondly, the clam pasta taste like crap. I am sorry to say this but there was barely any taste in the pasta. They were supposed to put moderate amount of olive oil with salt into the whole pasta. However, i did not taste any olive oil and flavor. The whole pasta is very boring tasting with the clams as though they didn't put any seasoning or effort into those. Both dishes i believe cost around $15 and its a huge disappointment for me. This place was too over priced and crowded. I rather just go to cheesecake factory and eat their pasta because cheesecake has better pasta and they give you a lot more. I was going to try their macaroons but i was so disappointed that i did not even want to spend anymore money at this place. I do not recommend this place to anyone who wants to try it. All i can say is that there are other places better than this place with the same price. This place is a total rip off and its too overrated for the price and qaulity.  I would never come back again to this place.

Three and a half stars. This place is super trendy. Big warehouse like space, high ceilings, white walls. We came for brunch on a Saturday with a party of three and were seated immediately a little before noon. The place was packed and loud. The food was good but in retrospect it was nothing special. We got: Eggs Benedict- this was good but standard, the arugula salad that came with it was tasty, portion seemed small for an eggs benedict dish, eggs were poached nicely Farmers Market Breakfast- this was just ok, it was really fresh tasting and all the veggies were crisp but it lacked seasoning for me. Small portion as well, very light dish. Burger- it was good, again a standard gourmet burger but it was huge and impressive looking. came with a heaping side of fries. This dish is probably the best bang for your brunch buck. Of course, I couldn't resist the gleaming little macaroons on my way out and got a box of five. We got the dark chocolate, rose, green tea, salted caramel, and earl grey.  Macaroons were fresh and the texture and richness were perfect. In terms of flavors, I really enjoyed the green tea and earl grey. Rose was too floral for me, dark chocolate tasted like a rich brownie, and salted caramel was not bad but not crazy good. Service was surprisingly not bad considering how busy our waiter was. Overall, good place to try, cool place to see and be seen, but I don't know if I'll be back.

I was very impressed by the customer service. Based on our reservation, the waiter came to our table and referred to us by the name we gave which was very classy. The room is huge and ambiance is so special. We went for an early dinner and  were dressed very casually. It felt like a high-class experience without any pretension.

This place is absolutely magical to me ^_^ Randomly stumbled upon this place as me and my friend were walking through downtown LA. We ordered boxes of macarons. The macarons were $2 each. They had a variety of flavors too. They are delicious! Brought some home to my family and they liked it. My favorite is their dark chocolate one which is actually red! Me and my friend split this dessert called "petite strawberry frasier." I chose this one because I like strawberries and it looked cute. It was heaven. I'm not exactly sure what was in it, but if I were to guess, I'd say strawberries, a layer of some sort of sponge cake, pastry cream, and something crunchy at the bottom. If you like strawberry shortcake then you'll like this one! It was so good. And the crunchiness, juiciness, and fluffiness textures of the dessert worked so well in my mouth! It was super loud when I was there (it was a Saturday night). And I'm not surprised, it was so crowded.

Hmm sorry to say... everything I ate here was pretty much just so-so... except for those tasty (expensive) little macarons, which were amazinggg. But ridiculously expensive. Portobello fries - I'm not a huge fan of mushroom, so these decent... but like I said, wasn't a huge fan. The aioli was a little too thick/mayo-y for me too. Burrata Pizza - Description sounded amazing: Burrata, grana parmesan, rapini, garlic, extra virgin olive oil & prosciutto di Parma. It was decent. The parts that had the burrata were moist and delicious! The parts without it were kind of blah. I expected more flavor overall, especially with prosciutto because I looove prosciutto! I had a couple bites which were extra garlicky and those were good too. But overall, unimpressed. Cheeseburger - Angus beef, Bibb lettuce, Brandywine tomato, red onion & house made aioli served with Kennebec French fries. This was better! Flavorful bun with sesame and other little grains. Juicy patty, good amount of cheese. But nothing that I daydream about or plan to come back here to get again. The fries were good, the aioli was pretty good. But again, not the best ever. Definitely ordered too much. Just the fries and pizza would have been enough for two. Their macaroons, which I got to-go after this crazy huge meal, were perfect - but pricy. I guess the price makes up for the cute gold specks. I liked the salted caramel and earl gray tea. Passion fruit was alright. The matcha & white chocolate was weird and slightly sour. I had a fifth green one which I think was pistachio, but I guess it wasn't that memorable considering that I don't even know what it was anymore. It's a beautiful space and very up-scale. The servers are dapper and dress like they might be seen on Mad Men. But the parking situation is nasty, too hyped with too long of a wait, and its too loud/echo-y to even hold a decent conversation - I think I'd only come back to give their brunch a shot or pick up some desserts for a special occasion.

Best portobello fries I've ever had. This place is super crowded all the time but the food is worth the wait. While you wait for your table, the bakery is right there as well so you can order some macaroons to keep you from starving. Nice decor, very modern. Their pizza was good,but I liked the pizza from mozza better. The eggs Benedict was delicious. I hate finding parking in Dtla, but the restaurant is right next to a parking lot or if you want to save a few dollars, park on the street.

Just came in for the macaron's! I love the vibrant colors and how they display all of their goodies. The restaurant itself looks very crisp and hip. Definitely would want to come back and sit down to try some of the food. The macaron's are very pricey. $2 for one, so be prepared to break the bank. It's pretty worth it though.. I got the box of 13 and almost got to get one of each flavor available. My favorite was the salted caramel. Everything else is pretty good too!

Great place to go for pizza!  We were there just to grab a quick bite but had to wait an hour for a table.  Nevertheless, the pizza was good - we got half sausage & half napoli.  Pizza is thin and light but full of flavor and pretty big given it's ~$20. Valet is $6. The wines by the glass are a slight disappointment though.  I'd expect better wines, especially the reds, for a place like this and given the prices for a glass. It's really loud inside, so it's not a good place for anyone looking to go on a first date here.

Earl grey macarons are the best. The place is really pretty, very "Extraordinary Desserts-esque" but a little cheaper. I tried some of the other desserts like the fruit tart and dark chocolate ganache mousse and thought it was good, nothing crazy amazing. But definitely the macarons impressed me. Hard to find parking in downtown LA, but this place is worth it. It is also within walking distance to the bench 500 Days of Summer was filmed at, nice place to grab dessert and walk there to eat.

I've been hearing my friends rave about this place for so long, so I had really high hopes for Bottega Louie (perhaps too high). I'd like to point out that this review is strictly for the bakery. I tried 5 macarons for $10. They came in a really cute little box. 5 stars for the presentation. The macarons were very tasty. They definitely lived up to the hype. I especially liked the passion fruit and matcha macarons. I also tried the rose, violet, and earl grey. They were great as well. 4.5 stars for the macarons The salted caramel eclair was really unimpressive. The salted caramel was good, but the eclair tasted old to me. I don't think I'll be getting another eclair here. 1 star for the eclair. Coconut Rocher was not bad, but nothing too special. It is a beautiful restaurant with super high ceilings and marble floors. I love the look of the entire place. Parking is a pain. I ended up paying $6 to park in the lot behind bottega. I think I'd come back to give the food a try Other than the Macarons,  the bakery didn't really leave me wanting more.

Bottega Louie was delicious!  It was a great place to have lunch with good food and a nice atmosphere.  The restaurant was packed for a Thursday afternoon but we were still seated within a decent amount of time by the hostess.  We were a party of five and shared two pizzas which were both tasty, but their sausage pizza was the best.  I couldn't wait to finish eating so I could get over to the bakery and pick out what I wanted. The desserts and pastries looked amazing, but I ended up getting three macaroons : Earl Grey, Rose Butter Cream and Strawberry. I enjoyed all flavors but they are sooo sweet, eating just one is enough.  The only thing I was unhappy about was the fact that there were unruly children running around the restaurant getting in the way. Other than that I will definitely be back to eat and try more desserts!

So many attractive people in one place. I was so absorbed in people watching and I swear if I was to apply for a job here, I would be rejected because I can't walk around in heels to save my life. I think the experience outweighs the taste of the food itself for sure. It is extremely loud in there because of their high ceilings, so it's probably not a cute date place unless you like barely being able to hear your partner. I came here with my boyfriend and we only had to wait about 20 minutes which was a blessing. By the time we left though, the place was as crowded as a club. We started with the Calamari and the Portobello Mushroom Fries. The fries were truly unique! Really thick slices of mushrooms with this delicious aioli sauce. However, after a few pieces it just felt too heavy. I would recommend ordering this if you have more than 2 people to share it with. The Calamari was SUCH a disappointment. SO average and not even good. On to the pizza. We decided to split it (pepperoni and burrata) and we had left overs. The crust was nice and thin which was nice but you could DEFINITELY get better pizza else where. I really loved the fact that they clearly used fresh cheese which was delicious but both the pepperoni and burrata needed something. Maybe more sauce? salt? I'm not sure but I would get my pizza fix elsewhere. The one thing that Bottega Louie DOES RIGHT is their desserts. We ordered the Chocolate Souffle and it was heavenly. It was my favorite part of the meal with that cream. Oh god it was amazing. I also couldn't leave this place without trying their Macarons so we got 5 macarons ($2 each- OUCH). We tasted the Pistachio, Strawberry, Green Tea Matcha, Salted Caramel and the Chocolate Orange. Out of them, my favorite was the Strawberry. Good stuff. The service is immaculate and I wouldn't mind coming back, but I'm definitely not rushing back any time soon. 3/5

We came here for dinner and then came here for brunch the very next day. Here are my thoughts. This place is the definition of FRENETIC. If you don't know what "frenetic" means, look it up. For dinner, we were seated right away (but we came in a bit before 6pm, on a Saturday). Appetizers: Sauteed spinach and bruschetta. The bruschetta was delicious. The spianch was too, but I could make this at home for $.25 (they charge like $8 or something). Dinner: Mushroom pizza. Mmmm. Thin crust. Delicious cheese. I thought this would be a single-person pizza, but it was HUGE. I managed to eat 4 pieces, but I was STUFFED (mind you, I had the appetizers and the weirdly-addictive bread they bring to the table). We also split a bottle of wine and then another glass each for dessert and the bill was still just around $150 (not bad for a trendy LA spot). Brunch was ridiculous in terms of the crowds. And I thought the mimosas were TINY. And the food is overpriced for what you get. I got the omelet with black beans, tofu, and avocado. There were like 2 cubes of tofu and 2 cubes of avocado. It doesn't come with potatoes or toast or anything. Meaning, I was still starving after and ordered a chopped salad (minus the salami) to fill me up a bit more. There were bits of salami in it, which might throw some vegetarians into convulsions (I just picked them out). I don't know if I would come back here. The service is great. There are just SO many people. And it's SO loud (high ceilings, bad acoustics).

Ambiance: Nearby metered parking is expensive..opted for the $5 lot next to restaurant. Wait was decent for brunch on Saturday before 11am. They only sit groups once everyone is there. Seating in the bakery section was less crowded, but tables only sit 2-3 people. Reminded me of an European cafe. The restaurant area is def. a bit loud, but perhaps a good enough reason to sit a little closer to your date. Service was great. Food: (Entree portions are def. for 1 person) 1. Lobster Hash- It tasted fine. Wished there was more lobster.  The hollandaise sauce was what gave it flavor. 2. Smoked Salmon Benedict- Heard this was tasty. Ask for the hollandaise on the side if you like to gauge how much to put on. 3.Farmers Market Breakfast- My friend thought it was decent. Small Dishes 4. Portobello Fries- Sliced portobello mushroom gently fried on the outside with just the right amount of salty seasoning with a side of aioli sauce. LOVED it. 5. Salmon Millefeuille- It's like a savory version of a Napoleon. Layers of salmon, creme fraiche, and puff pastry. UNIQUE and DELICIOUS. 3. Turkey Sausage- Tasty, but not spectacular. Dessert- I wanted to try everything! 1. "Exotic" Custard- Served in a thin vase with chocolate pudding, passionfruit gelatin?, white chocolate, and raspberries. MMMmmm.. 2. Tiramisu Eclair- Couldn't really taste the tiramisu.. meh 3. Beignets- Friends like the plain Beignets here. Get them at the bakery as they are cheaper. 4. Passionfruit tart- Friend loved it. 5. Grand Vanilla Macaroon with vanilla ice cream and raspberries- Beautiful presentation though kinda plain in taste. Guess it would be good if you really appreciated vanilla. 6. Macaroons- Liked the Espresso, Passionfruit, and Salted Caramel.  Rose was ok. Pistachio didn't really taste like pistachio.  Pricey at $2 each, but I guess it's decently priced for tasty macaroons. I heard that they may be cheaper if you tell them you don't need their fancy boxes. Pastries and chocolates make great gifts as they are all beautifully boxed in their pastel boxes.

This place is hoppin'! We came a little bit after 9 PM and the place was packed, we were worried it was going to be over an hour wait, but we were seated within 15 minutes.  The space is large, simple, clean with vaulted ceilings, and an open kitchen. A group a three of us dined here, we ordered about 5 small plates, everything was good, but what star of the night was the duck proscuitto crostini, crunchy and flavorful.  My least favorite plate was the lamb, I'm not a huge fan of lamb to begin with, and our piece was just a bit too tough.  The dessert counter is so fun! too bad most of them were sold out by the time we were done with dinner, we grabbed some French macarons and a mini meringue cake, both amazing! If i'm ever back in LA i'll definitely make it a point to stop here again.

2.5 stars. I'm in the minority but I do not care for Bottega Louie's space.  There's something about the stark white walls, the gold gilding, and the "Louie" written in cursive that screams CHEESY, not classy, to me.   I remember walking by the place long before I tried it tonight and thought the same thing.   I met a friend here for dinner tonight.  When she said, let's go to Bottega Louie, I didn't realize that it was THAT place, until I got there.  I loathe restaurants that refuse to take reservations but it was my friend's birthday and we hoped that meeting at 6pm on a Friday evening would be early enough. Our fears of a horrendous wait were quickly allayed when we were seated within 10 minutes of arrival.  The service of complimentary sparking or still water is a nice touch.  Our server promptly introduced himself and asked if we had dined there before.  When we both said no, he pointed out the layout of the menu and recommended several dishes.   We ordered the portobello fries, modena salad, eggplant parmesan, and tagliatelli bolognese to share.  The fries were brought to our table almost right after we ordered.  The kitchen must be turning them out en masse.  While the aioli served with the fries complemented them nicely, I did not like whatever the kitchen used to batter the mushrooms.  It also did not help that the fries were borderline lukewarm.  The salad arrived shortly after the fries.  Plenty of restaurants sell $12 starter salads but at that price, you want something more interesting than four stacked leaves of butter salad topped with some candied walnuts, goat cheese and a balsamic vinaigrette.   Before we were barely into the fries and salad, the pasta and eggplant parmesan were delivered.  Really?  I can't tell if that's poor service or a thinly veiled attempt to turn over the table as soon as possible.  Our small table was suddenly over cluttered with four plates of food, two glasses, a carafe of water, and our plates.  By the time we finished the fries and salad, the pasta and eggplant were no longer hot. The tagliatelli was fine but unremarkable.  The eggplant parmesan was disappointing.  The sauce tasted like it came from a jar, and not a good one, and the breading was soggy.  We each took a small bite and left the rest.   For dessert, we ordered the chocolate souffle.  It was the best thing we had, light and chocolatey.  It was nice to finally have something at the correct temperature.   The service was friendly and attentive, though at times, it felt too attentive.  The bus boys would ask if we were finished with our plates several times when there was clearly food left.  Our water glasses were constantly being filled and we were checked on often.  I couldn't tell if the servers were subtly trying to tell us to leave.   Admittedly, we had a very leisurely dinner that lasted over four hours.  After awhile, they figured we were staying until we were ready to leave.  We made up for overstaying our visit by leaving a 50% tip. In all, underwhelming, given the glowing reviews.  When I think of an Italian cafe at the price point that Bottega Louie is, Bottega Louie is not what comes to mind.  And it certainly did not look anything like the Italian restaurants we dined at in Italy earlier this year.  Bottega Louie is much too baroque in appearance and lacking in substance.  Thank goodness we didn't have to wait that long for a table.  I would be much less forgiving if I had to wait over an hour for our experience.

The portobello fries were the star of the show during our brunch! It was my 1st time trying them and I'm so glad my friend recommended it. The Caprese salad was full of flavor as well, I would definitely say that is my new favorite type of salad. I also ordered some macarons to go and this place seriously does not skimp out on the packaging, it was so cute! And the macarons were delicious as well! They also have a big variety of sweets and a bar that serves alcohol as well as makes juices.

If you've ever been to Paris, you know this place is trés chic.  Whether you do lunch or dinner your experience will be highly satisfying.  For a minute, you do not feel like you are in DTLA, but in a highly cosmopolitan city. Their artisan bread is great as is there pizza and roasted chicken.  While their deconstructed caesar salad is good, I would skip it.   As for desserts, of course try the macaroons.  The creme bruleé is good; though not the best I've had; as is there chocolate torte. A great date place...so go on take your gal out for dinner...or for you progressive girls take your guy out for lunch.

Busted and disgusted from a doctor visit, my ass needed a pick-me-up.  Doctor visits are never fun for me.  Feelings range from terror, to horror, to fright...and everything in between.  Especially when I go online days prior and diagnose every mild symptom I have as being cancer. Oh brother. The homie, Ching T, was my chauffeur for the day, and she decided that Bottega was the perfect "calm the fuck down, Valerie" antidote to my poisonous, toxic anxiety.   Man...I love Ching T.  Marry me.   (She says hi to you all, by the way.) Bottega.  Was.  Perfect.  Walk in and there are crisp, clean, white walls, an enormously high ceiling, spotless wine and water glasses, waiters and cooks meticulously at work, uniforms immaculate.  Even the damn dessert section of Bottega is picture-perfect.   Wait...is this Heaven?  I didn't die during the doctor visit, did I? And the food...oh my, the food:  It may not be tip top 5 star as the best food ever in life, but you get a solid 4 Star superb meal from these people.  We had the mushroom pizza and duck prosciutto.  The pizza had a thin, woodfired crust with Fontina cheese, mozzarella, crème fraîche, shiitake mushrooms, garlic and parsley...and a slight touch of extra virgin olive oil for umph.  I showed that pizza who was the boss.  The duck prosciutto crostini was thinly sliced duck over a toasted slice of bread topped with artichoke and a "pine nut - olive oil - onion - balsamic" reduction.  Tangy, lightly crunchy, and very satiating. The dessert:  GET THE HOUSE MADE CREME BRULEE...not the pre-made ones.  Trust me.  And we each sampled a mini blackberry and blueberry tart.   Topped this heavenly shit off with a Gin and ginger ale cocktail, and the anxiety was gone.  Thank you, Dr. Ching.

I walked in around 8:30 PM on a Thursday night and was told it was going to be a 45 min-1 hour wait.  I was starving but we already parked the car so we were committed.  While waiting, I browsed the dessert bar and couldn't resist getting a grand macaron and a vanilla cupcake. The decor is interesting.  It's a mix of classy and street cafe.  I dig it.   When we were finally seated, I was so excited that I had a goofy smile on my face as I looked through the menu.  We ordered: Burrata Pizza - I was the most excited for this since we were sitting right next to where they were preparing the pizza.  It looked so good.. then you put it in your mouth and it's just bland.  It was odd to me that the pizza was hot but they put globs of cold cheese on it.  Maybe I'm just not cultured enough. Mache Salad - I'm obsessed with salad.  Wherever I go, I usually need to try a salad. The chicken was dry and the avocado wasn't ripe.  This was probably the biggest disappointment of all. Portobello Fries - This small plate was the shining star of the meal.  The little thing of aioli it came with was really good too.  The pizza was so bland I started dipping it in there too. Creme Brulee - It was basic.  There was a lot of burnt sugar on top.  More than I'm used to. Overall, everything looked so amazing when it came to the table.  The food is less than mediocre. The host and people taking care of our table were great.   I really wanted to like this place.  Maybe the dinner isn't as good?  Perhaps, we didn't order the right things?

3.5 stars After 3 separate visits to Bottega Louie, I'm satisfied with the restaurant, but not necessarily a fan. It's a beautiful space on the corner of 7th Street and Grand Avenue, its big glass windows beckoning you inside with a full view of their rainbow tower of macarons. It's a place you'd expect somewhere in the posh parts of NYC or perhaps in the Century City/Beverly Hills part of the Westside of LA. The restaurant and bakery, with its extremely high ceilings, clean white walls and minimalist interior, and renowned menu items and pastries, has been hit-or-miss for me. There's a lot on the menu to try. Sadly, not all of it is done well, although you get the sense that the ones that miss the mark are trying really hard to gain your approval. The staff has been hit-or-miss too, with those who have the smile, professionalism, and skill to bring back repeat customers, and others who make you wonder if you should've picked Bottega Louie to eat at that day at that time. I've been there for lunch and weekend brunch. Some things to note: 1) Weekday breakfast is served only until 10am. Only the lunch/dinner menu is available after that. 2) Get to Bottega Louie early, no matter which meal you choose to eat there. It gets extremely busy for lunch and brunch. 3) They will not seat your party until every last person is present and accounted for.   For the weekend brunch, the menu provides a nice assortment of breakfast and lunch items, with a range of price points. With the sunlight pouring in through the giant windows, this is probably the best time to go enjoy a meal at Bottega Louie. Also, lot parking next door is $5 on Saturdays/Sundays. I had the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. Good, but underwhelming in presentation and taste. I got four pancakes, about 6"-7" in diameter, with a small handful of blueberries scattered around the plate, and a small pitcher of housemade blueberry syrup, which is very subtle and mostly tastes like maple syrup. I would've opted for one fewer pancake, more blueberries, and maybe a garnish of lemon zest and a dollop of cream. Overall, they were fluffy, moist, and filling, but a little plain. I also tried my friend's French Toast. It was too bready and not appetizing. Disappointing, considering French toast is my breakfast item of choice. For the weekday lunch, the menu was disappointing, but that's because my friends and I came at 11am expecting breakfast. As time wore on to noon, the restaurant filled almost to capacity. The noise levels rose quickly, exacerbated by the high ceilings and the open kitchen area. Our server seemed relatively new, with a nervous energy and lack of menu knowledge. He had a good sense of humor though, which helped gloss over forgetting the coffee and accidentally throwing a spoon at my friend (his hand slipped, but man, did that spoon fly!). We ordered the Portobello Fries to start. One-inch thick portobello mushroom slices lightly battered and fried, with parmesan cheese and parsley (?) baked or sprinkled on.  They came with a light green sauce, which tasted like an avocado aioli. Definitely worth getting to share. Then, I ordered the Orecchiette. It was all wrong. The pasta was a little firmer than al dente, making it too dry and chewy, and it was all stuck together. I did not see any broccolini or rainbow chard. Instead, there was a lot of overcooked, very bitter radicchio, making the dish mostly unappetizing. The sausage was good, as was the unlisted diced pancetta (?), which went well with the added breadcrumbs. Pictures online show a very different dish. One friend ordered the Ceppo Gamber pasta, and the pasta in that dish was very doughy and undercooked as well. The dish would've been better with capellini vs. ceppo pasta, since it wasn't in a heavy sauce. My other friend ordered the Porchetta sandwich, and that redeemed lunch. The bun alone made the sandwich worth eating. Add the slow roasted pork and fresh veggies and the light brined caper aioloi, and I could forget about my bitter pasta dish. It was Mmm...  Even the extra crisp, earthy french fries it came with were excellent. I'd go back for the Porchetta. We finished our high-low meal with the Panna Cotta for dessert. The blood orange gelée on top was a little too tart for me, but it cut through the heavy texture of the panna cotta. Not bad, but it seemed more like a panna cotta with an identity crisis. It was bright and beautiful though. As for the boutique bakery, the display case will make you want to take pictures, even if you don't normally do that type of thing. Most of the pastries and desserts look too pretty to eat. Beware though, service is unreliable. The guy helping me today kept running his gloved hands along the top of the display case, covered with dust, oils, and who knows what else, before getting my pastries, defeating the point of the gloves. I had to ask him to change his gloves before he handled the macarons I got. I was already grossed out though. A definite mi

Such a lovely experience!! We've have drove by I don't know how many times and always say  "Omgosh we have to eat there, omgosh look at the window sitting, everything is so white omgooooshhh" Lol you get it. And finally we did last night. First of all, it was crazy busy, so loud and outrageous but so many smiles and people really enjoying themselves. We checked in. Got some macaroons while waiting, which were delicious. You just HAVE to try them. I love how they have a full bar (Note to self, coming on a Saturday night to drink a few while waiting for our table) I will say, the wait seemed so unorganized. You give your name and that's it. I did not see any system as to how you would know if you were up next. That I would hope they improve in. We finally got seated aaaand window sitting! Perfect! Just so special and cute. We got the portobello fries which of course were BOMB!! The Cesar salad was so good/fresh and the bread omgosh yes the bread with butter. Um we ordered it 3 times lol oops. I got shrimp and pasta (already forgot the name of the dish) and my love got lasagna. Both were delicious. Come here with patience, so worth it.  Price is not bad at all. The dine in experience and quality of everything is beyond worth it!! We will be back for sure.

Once upon a time, Bottega Louie was one of the main catalysts of the revitalization that was/is happening downtown. And once upon a time, it was a really fun place to enjoy a tasty, but not amazing meal, even if you were willing to turn a blind eye (or deaf ear), to the atrocious acoustics. But lately when I've come here, it's gotten so crowded and obnoxious on the weekends that I can't really bring myself to come anytime between Thursday to Sunday night. Like UCLA's library, Bottega Louie has become overrun by hordes of Asians. Specifically swarms of female Asians from the Westside, the 562, and the OC and wherever petite, bouncy Asian girls live -  girls who take photos of their food, who get overly excited about the macaroons here, and who never finish anything they order I was, and still am, a fan of Bottega. It's still my go-to place when I'm taking someone who wants to see how downtown LA has turned around. The food is certainly tasty, casual, well-executed fare - although some dishes are better than others. Pizzas are awesome, portobello fries, the trenne pasta (!). Other perks include: the BYOB, the appealing design, the pastries, the lattes. And the service has always been very good. I just can't bring myself to come here on a weekend night anymore.

This place is super touristy. Its a combination of an upscale and hipster vibe. Located in the heart of DTLA. I like the ambiance of the place, its very romantic with the dim ambient lighting and vaulted ceilings. The only down side is that this place get VERY LOUD. It's somewhat hard to hear the person you're having a conversation with even though you're sitting at the same table. The food was pretty good. I have tried the burrata, sausage, arugula, and mushroom pizzas. My favorite was the burrata and the mushroom pizza, but they were all still good. I've had the ceppo gamber pasta which I enjoyed very much. It's in a light olive oil based pasta sauce with tomatoes and shrimps. Definitely try it! The Portobello fries are AMAZING!!!! omg I get this every time i come here. Bottega Louie is famous for their French macarons and I've tried all of their flavors. I only like a few of them (Earl Grey, Espresso, Rose, Strawberry). I feel like these flavors are so generic and I've had better macarons. Overall I was pleased with this place, I'd definitely come back to try different dishes and more of their amazing-looking desserts.

I took my girlfriend here a few months ago on a date and I got many brownie points. I picked her up at her house and she looked so beautiful in her green dress. I remember she said to me, "I wanted to look good for you so you always remember me being pretty." I have cherished those words till this day. When we got there, I mentioned to her how good their Penne Gamber was. It was a shrimp pasta dish. I ordered the Trenne, a pan fried pasta with some sort of beef that I can't remember. But I do remember that the Penne Gamber was much better. We also ordered portobello fries, it was good at first, but then the mushroom got to my head (I don't like mushrooms much). You would think an appetizer and entree would be enough for two, wrong. We elected on ordering pizza. We are such piggies. We did a half and half. Half sausage and half clam pizza. Both were delicious. Unfortunately, we could not finish our meal and decided to get it to-go. As the night dwindled down, we walked towards the exit until we reached their macaron station. Of course I couldn't let us leave without getting one of her favorite desserts! "May we get a box of 13. pistachio, pumpkin, earl grey..." Yeah...she left a happy woman. We walked the night away hand in  hand. What a fun date night :]

I wish they had Bottega Louie in San Francisco.  If they did, I'd be there every Sunday for brunch.  We had our concierge call ahead to confirm a reservation so that we wouldn't have to wait in line.  I opened the door and there staring straight at me was a visual paradise of macaroons, fresh baked pastries and desserts.  I literally wanted to order it all.   Our brunch order: -FRENCH TOAST -House made pain de mie, seasonal berry compote, Vermont maple syrup & honey $12 -PROSCIUTTO & BURRATA - Prosciutto, burrata, basil & extra virgin olive oil on a potato pancake $9 -BEIGNETS - Four beignets & raspberry compote $8 -ASPARAGUS & EGG - Altar asparagus & poached egg $10 -HONEYDEW MELON JUICE $5 -BERRY LEMONADE $4 -An assortment of macaroons $2 each Free sparkling water.

This place is beautiful! From the outside, you would never guess how bright and spacious it is inside. It's a great contrast from the dark downtown skyscraper buildings surrounding the building. Parking is easy to find, since you can park a block down further for a parking garage and while your way there. When you first walk in, you're blinded from the white walls and how much light it bounces off from it. You're overwhelmed with all the great and beautifully desserts on display. Although it is clean and elegant from all the white walls, I do believe Bottega Louie would benefit with artwork. Service is great most of the time. I only say this because one employee was downright rude and had a huge attitude when I was ordering bread and desserts. This was consistent from a later visit, helped by the same employee and there was no change in her attitude. When I visited for a meal, my waiter was great! He was prompt and tried his best to help even though it was prime lunch rush. Food is to die for. It is flavorful, fresh and made with great ingredients. While you're waiting for your table, you can watch how the food some of the food are prepared from the open kitchen. I am in LOVE with their breads and mushroom fries. Their baguettes are soft yet has a great crust and filled with flavors. Their chocolate croissant is so light and flaky, and has good balance with chocolate. I hate to admit but I bought their baguette and ate almost the whole thing with butter in one sitting if I had not realized and force myself to stop - it was so good! The portobello mushroom fries was something I wanted to try from yelp tips and from my friend who suggested it. It was definitely something worth paying $10 for. I thought it was going to be mushy but it was full and deep with flavor and crunch. There are many selections for vegetarians to eat. A great place where to bring my vegetarian friends. I will definitely keep this place for a must while staying/visiting/living in Los Angeles. I can't wait to visit again.

Dining at Bottega Louie feels like I'm hanging out in Vegas at Ceasar's (reference to the giant white greekesque columns). The vibe is trendy, posh, over the top grandiose, one could say a bit pretentious, and let's not forget loud. Dropped in with 3 of my friends on a weekday and was seated immediately. Having not been warned I was dining out I was in my basketball shorts, but nobody hassled me so I ate in complete comfort. Our waiter was informative and gave some decent recs. Food: Portobello Fries: This came highly regarded and recommended supposedly being incredibly addictive. I thought they were just okay, the dipping sauce was addictive part but as far as fried mushrooms go they were just that fried mushrooms. To each their own I guess. Margherita pizza- I really enjoyed the tomato sauce they concocted and slathered  on their pizzas, and seeing as how they used a giant wood oven burning stove in the middle of their restaurant the crust came out really well. Sausage pizza- mmm again the tomato sauce base was awesome and being the carnivore that I am adding sausage only heightened the taste of the pizza. Lasagna- When something is good, rinse and repeat over and over. MORE TOMATO SAUCE! What can I say, it was a delicious lasagna. Ceppo gamber- Pasta was cooked to a nice al dente and the olive oil broth was fragrant. The jumbo shrimp was respectable. I guess all in all I thought the food was good, but it's just not the type of vibe I like to dine in. Sure I could walk in with basketball shorts, but the over the top decor was a turn off. That's just me tho, I can see some ppl enjoying the grandiose experience. Down to earth is more on my level, but it could be a good place to impress a date.

Came here on a Wednesday night around 10:20 or so and it was still pretty packed.  Waited about 15 minutes for a table.   The Service --- The service was excellent.  Instead of giving us a buzzer or calling out a name, the hostess came and found us when our table was ready.  The waiter as well as the bus boys were great.  One negative was that it was really loud so I could barely hear the waiter when he would ask me questions.  Although that's not a negative towards the service, of course. The Food --- Now the food is the reason for the 3 stars. We got the French Onion Soup which I know is usually salty, but this one was reeeeeally salty.  We also got the Trenne pasta which was a triangular penne and was I think fried so it was hard and kind of crunchy.  It came with kale and beef and had a stew-like flavor.  I didn't much like it at first but it kind of grew on me.  The last thing we got was the Tagliatelle Bolognese which I didn't like at all.  To me it didn't have much flavor and the flavor it did have just wasn't that great.  It kind of tasted like a frozen dinner pasta.  Shame on us, we didn't get dessert, but it was late and I was tired.   The Prices --- Our total for the soup and 2 pasta dishes came out to around $60. I was disappointed with the food.  Maybe I was ordering the wrong thing.  I'm willing to go back and give it another shot.  Maybe try a pizza and definitely the dessert.  With all the good reviews on Yelp, I feel like my experience was a fluke!

This place is GREAT! Great ambiance, food, decor, people, service, location everything is just fab! So Bottega is a really modern chic restaurant. The wait at any given time of the day here is a rather lOOoooOng one. But I assure you that it is well worth it. I got the moulin rogue cocktail..which was pleasntly good. It was a bit citrusy but not in a bad way. Now the portobello fries left me speechless......they are amazing! Those are a must try!! They have a large amount of dessert options, they have a cute bakery in the restaurant. The macaroons I heard are a must have. FYI there is parking right behind the restaurant.. And if you are going for dinner and want to go out after, they let you leave your car there.

This rating is tough because I would give 5 stars for the tasty meals, but read on.... I went there once within the last month with my husband and 3 other family members and tasted everyone's dish.  That's how we roll.  I enjoyed everything.   Food was absolutely delicious.  For dessert, I ordered the Panna Cotta and took most of it home with half of my meal (OrEcchiette).  The next day I was looking forward to eating my meal again (yum!).  After I removed my meal from the microwave and placed it on my plate, I noticed a hair in my food (and it wasn't mine)! :-/   Bump it!  It was gross but I was hungry and the food was nuked, so I pushed that portion of food aside and cleaned up my plate.  (Don't judge me!)  I then looked forward to my dessert, when I friggin noticed another hair.  I went to pick it out and it kept going and going and going.  That damn hair was long and inside my dessert!  I almost threw up my leftovers, but I was stronger than I thought and just closed the box and threw it away.  I do have my limits (one hair a day in my food is enough!).  Kidding, but really Bottega Louie!  Your food was great, but PLEASE, that was the last hair I ever want to see in my food anywhere!  Oh, wait.  I know if you keep your business booming you may ignore everyone saying that the place is loud.  Please don't ignore it!  Your place is too damn loud!  Isn't there anything you can do about that?  When you have a private room and invite me back to enjoy your hairless food in this private room with some Italian music piped in, I'll come back.

The desserts are beautiful! I came to eat lunch with two friends and we had a great time waiting looking at the beautiful desserts. Once we got seated our server was quite attentive and checked on us often to make sure we were okay. We ordered the mushroom pizza, shrimp pasta, and a strawberry shortcake. All three items were quite delicious. The pizza had white sauce and had the perfect combination of garlic, mushroom, texture and chewiness of the dough. The shrimp pasta was also good but I enjoyed the pizza more. The strawberry shortcake was so moist! This place definitely has great desserts. I would love to come back to try more desserts and different items on the menu.

I was super excited to come here after reading all the reviews :( Unfortunately, this place was just ok. The wait time wasn't long; we went around noon-ish. My boyfriend and I ordered the bolognese and a chicken dish with capers and artichokes. The presentation was so pretty! The chicken dish was super yummy! I don't really like artichokes, but this was so good. It was tender, and juicy, but borderline salty. The bolognese on the other hand...tasted like Spaghetti-O's. It wasn't hot, wasn't even that warm, and my boyfriend, who usually loves pasta, was unable to finish half of this :( On the other hand, the macarons are so good. The espresso and strawberry were our favorites. The strawberry has real strawberries inside the cream!

Upon stepping into BL you see the cutesy decorations reminiscent of Ladurée (complete with the decorative macaron "croquembouche"). Being a French dessert and macaron fan I came here specifically for this but since we were getting hungry we decided to stay for lunch. The staff was great. From the initial greet from the host to the friendly server I felt we were treated as if we were at a much fancier bougie restaurant. We started off with drinks. I had a glass of Moët et Chandon and he had a glass of Stella. The menu wasnt too exciting so we opted to share the Napoli pizza and Kennebec French Fries. It wasn't bad. On our way out we picked up a few of what we initially came for - the macarons. I've definitely had better. Perhaps if I lived in LA and worked downtown, Bottega Louie would be a great lunch spot to go. Otherwise I probably won't ever come all the way out this way specifically for BL again.

I had such a good time, I guess cause I was with people that I really enjoy being with. well I love the atmosphere of this place, casual but classy, they got some really cute waiters. ;) I'm so sorry i couldn't give y'all a specific review because I had glass of chardonnay, then a bottle of Cabernet ... all I remember was the laughter & jokes we made on the table.. the food was okay, but I do love the appetizers!! ... of course gotta get desert!! I didn't try anything else other than their macaroons... which is pretty good, I think i had the tiramisu one which is less sweeter than the other ones ... I will def. go back to this place soon.

A nice restaurant in Downtown LA. If you come during busy hours, expect a long wait. They do not take reservations, so probably not a good place for a big party. They have a sit-down restaurant and a bakery where you can buy pasties/macaroons to go. :) Food: -pizza: thin crust, oven-baked pizza.. the margherita is pretty good, but I wouldn't say the best I've had -portobello mushroom fries: pretty tasty Dessert: -macaroons: amazing! Parking: $5 for the parking lot right next to the restaurant

Parked next door for a weekend flat rate of $5. Put our names in and waited about 30 min. We watched the chef's work with beautiful and fresh ingredients while we waited, so it helped pass the time.   Pepperoni and sausage pizza: good.. Fresh.. Salted caramel macaroon and vanilla...WOW.... so good! It was pricey.... but lunch was a hit.  I would go back for sure!

I can't believe that until recently, I have never heard of this place. And I live in LA...shameful. I love that this place makes me feel all classy and LA and that the restaurant is like an upscale NY restaurant except with much more space. My sister came here a week before I did and raved  about the trenne pasta and portobello mushroom fries. Since neither my friend nor I were fans of portobello, we skipped that but got the pasta and panzanella salad instead. The pasta was good but it didn't work well with the prime rib. I expected the pasta dish to be creamy and heavy, but it was light and filling. The dish was more like a hearty prime rib stew with pan fried pasta in it. Not what I expected. The two should've been kept separate in my opinion. The panzanella salad was very delightful. It was also not what I expected it to be. The mascarpone cheese was very delicious and although I liked the dressing, I wish it were creamier. It was just a runny vinaigrette. On to desert. We decided to try the budino since the waiter suggested it. It was very creamy and I liked the touch of sea salt. But it was a bit too sweet for me. And I love sweet things. I prefer the macarons here to Lette in Pasadena. Although the macarons at Lette have a better crunch to them and fall apart beautifully when bitten, the macarons here are less sweet than those at Lette.  [ not sure if this makes any sense o.O] Lette's are too sweet and they taste too artificial for my liking. I would definitely recommend the matcha and passion fruit macaron. The passion fruit one even comes with little chunks of fruit in it :) and it had just the right amount of sweetness. The earl grey is pretty to look at but it didn't do much for me taste-wise. I think it's funny how when you order 5 macarons you get a pretty little purple box, for 13 you get a prettier pink box and for 36 ( I think) you get a new car! Just kidding. But it's a nice marketing ploy to get people to buy more macarons, because the only other way to get the box is to pay for it. This box thing really doesn't appeal to me, but my sister was going nuts for it. lol

Food was just 3 stars for me, but 4 stars for the atmosphere.  I definitely would come back to Bottega Louie, though not because the food is particularly crave-worthy. This is the perfect place to take friends visiting from out of town.  It's also the perfect place to grab a late dinner (they are open pretty late) and drinks before walking to a bar or lounge in the downtown area.  There is a good amount of nightlife options within walking distance of Bottega Louie, so that is a definite plus if you are looking for a place to eat before going out. My friend and I arrived around 9:30pm on a Friday and the entire restaurant was filled, very lively.  The host/hostess table is past the bar; you have the option of putting your name down for a table or scouting out a place to sit in the bar section, where they also have full dining service.  The host told us it was a 45 min wait, but we checked back after getting a drink and a table was available. Food: It was okay, considering the price point.  I liked the portobello mushroom fries the most and would order again.  The trenne pasta was decent, though I probably will try something new the next time I return.  The mozzarella stick (stick, not sticks - you get one) was below average for the price, so I would not re-order. Drinks: I had the Moulin Rouge.  Totally girly, but good.  The bartenders were nicer than our server. Overall, I like Bottega Louie for its location and lively atmosphere.  It's just enough "trendy LA" without being too overpriced and obnoxious.  I'll definitely come back if I want to grab a drink or a bite to eat before going out downtown.

My mom brought me here about two and a half years ago. I honestly don't get the hype. All of their food either comes in portions too small, is overly greasy, or just tastes gross. Even their pasta salads were disappointing, and my family wasn't a fan of the "overly sugary macaroons". I haven't had their souffle but it seems quite pricy, a $15 dessert I've had for $10-$12 elsewhere.

Odd place for a nice restaurant & bakery. Staff is very friendly, since it was my first time the person helping me out gave me a malasada for free.

Fabulous place for a big group.  Its a bit loud but tables are small enough that you can have a conversation. The appetizers were amazing.  I would highly recommend the portobello  fries and duck prosciutto crostini. For our entrees, we recommend the ahi tuna, short ribs, trenne pasta and shrimp scampi (the size of small lobsters)  They were outstanding.  Save room for desserts, it is worth every bite.  We shared the chocolate soufflé, pear tart and savor the kiwi sorbet.  The best part of our meal was the service, Emily treated us with smiles and top notch class.  After dessert, we bought macaroons and fresh bread to enjoy the next day.  Worth the wait as they do not take reservations.  Bon appetit!

Came here for brunch on a Saturday morning, around 11am. I had the ahi tuna nicoise and some portabello fries with garlic aioli. Despite the food being slightly overpriced, I quite liked it. The tuna was really tender, a definite upgrade to the canned texture I was expecting. It wasn't full of fat, like tuna normally is, but somehow they managed to get it to be moist and flavorful after shredding it up into tiny pieces. The green beans and tomatos were also very good. Was a very solid $10 dish, but ehhhh on the $15. I think the portabello mushroom fries are a bit overhyped. Honestly, anything can taste good with batter and deep-fried, and these were no different. The mushrooms lended a delicious umami flavor to the overall dish, though, which I made a huge difference in the way fries normally taste. They were cut extremely thick, which I think destroyed some of the balance of the batter-to-meat ratio, but it was rectified once I dipped it in some garlic aioli. Definitely not worth $10, but good. The acoustics of this place totally sucks. According to Rain F., it was due to the fact that it was a bank location that was converted to a restaurant, which accounted for the high ceilings. Basically I could hear echoes and barely the conversationist across the table from me. Not quite the best scenario given the type of restaurant and the price of food. Service is decent, I guess because this restaurant is so busy. They got us in efficiently enough, and we did get our waters refilled every so often. Awesome.

My love / hate relationship continues with Bottega.  I don't know why they are so inconsistent.  It's like having a lover you want to both punch and f*ck at the same time. I've never had a bad experience at the bar.  The Man and I truly love spending a leisure Saturday afternoon here, drinking Bellinis and noshing on some great food.  I never sit in the dining room because in the past when I have, the food has always been a hit or miss.  My BIGGEST beef from day one has to be the service at the pastry counter.  I have no idea if these jerks get a beatin' after work or just have the intellectual capacity of a baby born from crack addicted parents but, I truly want to put them over my knee and smack the shit outta them.  Rude, stupid, zombified caricatures.  I swear, they piss me off every single time since Bottega has opened.   "I dare you test me one more time, fool.  Don't f*ck with an angry Korean chick jonesin' for a sugar fix."

A group of 8 of us took a friend to dinner here. The service was good, and everyone liked their food, though looking back, I don't recall what I ate - it was unremarkable. The desserts looked amazing, but all contained milk, so none for me. The ambiance was hip and European, and the menu had the typical Cali twist of using really obscure ingredients, or at least obscure names for common ingredients. Like fancy mushrooms no one has ever heard of. It was a nice outing.

People have continuously complained about this place. "It used to be good, but not anymore" "The wait is too long" "It's too loud" "Service sucks" BLAH BLAH BLAH I haven't been here too many times to know the declination of the quality of their food so I can't agree with the rumors I've heard. All 5 times I've been here I've had an amazing meal with amazing company. If you are one of those people who complain about the noise level in this establishment, you need to STFU. That is what this place is about! Loud and bustling crowds coming in and out every hour! I love this place, feels super New York and not the typical LA restaurant. Of course the size of this place isn't NY at all but the decor sure does. I love the high ceilings and the open kitchen. They have a pastry section for quick togo desserts and a bar with seating area for those who do not want to wait. Luckily for me, I never have to wait. My dear friend Joanna P. lives nearby and can get reservations (haha)! THANK YOU JOANNA P.!!! I love this place. I always start with a glass of rose and end with at least 3 glasses in me. I love their brunch, lunch and dinner. Pizza, eggs benedict, portobello fries, the list goes on. This place is fun and employees people who look better than the average person. If you're in a rush, don't come here cause you'll have to wait. But if you've got time, come and enjoy the ambiance and some alcohol along with their food.

What is better than a birthday cake? A chocolate soufflé from Bottega Louie of course!! I dined here for my birthday on a rainy December night. Bottega Louie doesn't take reservations so we decided to hurry over around 6pm. We parked in the structure across the street and a short walk away from the restaurant since we didn't feel like scavenging for parking spaces. Upon sauntering in, we were immediately seated. No wait! Yay! To start off we shared the calamari. The calamari was pretty tasty and is a pretty dependable appetizer choice to munch on while picking away at the bread. I ordered the Trenne dish and green tea mojito, my boyfriend ordered the caesar salad, my father the ceppo gamber, and my mother the lasagna. According to my boyfriend, that was the best caesar salad he's ever had. My mother's lasagna portion was larger than expected and very homey. It was one of those dishes that still tastes delicious the next day when you reheat it with your other random leftovers. The gamber was a perfect choice for my father because he has ulcerative colitis and can't eat spicy or greasy foods. The trenne was very good as well. I loved the bits of braised prime rib eye at the bottom. It was like a treasure hunt for gold! I've been on a mojito kick and the green tea mojito, although non-alcoholic (booo!), was a pleasant twist. As mentioned above, I opted for the chocolate soufflé instead of a normal birthday cake. DELICIOUS! I had been craving a soufflé and Bottega Louie satisfied my taste buds. CHOCOLATEY GOODNESS! To finish off my delectable birthday meal, my boyfriend treated me to the gorgeous macaroons from the bakery. So yummy! Expensive but definitely worth it.

A crowd pleaser.  This is my go-to for downtown dinners with out of town guests.  The ambiance alone is worth 4 stars.  It's lively, trendy, and the food has always been on target.  The wines are a bit pricey, but I guess you're paying for a bit of the ambiance with every drink. Tip--if you don't want to wait for a seat in the main dining room, the small tables in the front of the restaurant are first-come first-serve.

I fell in LOVE with Bottega Louie on sight. Chic white decor and fancy-fancy but family ok vibe to the entire restaurant. The desserts are to die for--and that's not including the beautiful presentation of the cakes, macarons, and little tarts. I can't walk in here without wanting to buy every. single. dessert. in the display. Delicious macarons made with the right consistency and texture; tempting, perfect cakes behind the glass, both small and large. Friendly and helpful service. Absolutely perfect for a lunch date with the girls or a casual thing with the boyfriend:)

But everything in here is seriously amazing, except that it's really bustling, loud, crowded and the service, though overbearing at first, quickly became non-existent. Things to Try: -Moulin Rouge cocktail (Tru Lemon Vodka, St. Germain, lemon, simple syrup & raspberries) mixed smoothly and non-too-sweet for $12 -Champs Elysees cocktail (Domaine du Tariquet Bas-Armagnac, Green Chartreuse, Angostura bitters, lemon juice & simple syrup) for $12 -Modena salad (head of butter lettuce, candied walnuts, crumbled goat cheese, shallots, garden herbs & plenty of balsamic vinaigrette) for $12 -Margherita pizza (even though it was burnt and the waiter did not seem to ask/care that all the burnt pieces were left on my plate, it was surprisingly still delicious. You can tell they choose their ingredients carefully and can even do a halfsie pizza if you are splitting with a partner) for $20 -Butterscotch Busino (deliciously rich butterscotch custard with fleur de sel & chantilly whipped cream) for $9 -Macarons (choose any 4 assortment of flavors, though my favorite is the strawberry, and they literally melt lovingly in your mouth) for $8

Must-haves: Pistachio Macaron [B], Lemon Macaron [B] Skip: N/A The experience at Botega Louie is what makes this place so great. Lot's of attractive people from LA looking sharp and trying to make an impression. The Maserati's and Aston Martin's outside help do that too. The venue is open and very spacious. Botega Louie sports high ceilings and gold trim. The indoor is décor chic and very elegant. This is one of those places you would expect to see a celebrity =D I had the lobster hash which was pretty tasty. It was nice to see lobster alone and not drowned in mayonnaise. Bakery Macaron FIESTA! Although I didn't think these were the best macarons I've tasted in Southern California, the selection and presentation of the macarons was stellar. My favorites were the pistachio, lemon and surprisingly, the earl grey. This bakery also has a variety of other desserts you've probably never heard about. I had a very unique dessert that looked like a putting green for golf! Be adventurous! Every dessert I had here was amazing. Service was below average. Asked for recommendations and got very generic answers. One of the servers dropped some tomatoes on her area and asked her to clean it up! Food: B | Service: D | Selection: A | Experience: A | Overall:  B

I am a regular here, yes. I work in the fashion district here in downtown, which makes it easy for me to stop by and grab some snacks... (aka macarons) Macarons are $2 each. Comes in cute boxes when you order more.. Salted Caramel macaron is my personal favorite. I can't get enough of it. It's safe to say that they make these delicacies perfectly. Not till last week did I actually dine in and try their foods. My sisters and I met up with my cousin for brunch on a Friday morning, almost 11 AM. NO BRUNCH MENU ON WEEKDAYS :( Only on weekends. So we were stuck with the regular lunch/dinner menu, which is still fine. I didn't mind. I tried everything that our tabled order, no shame. And here are my thoughts on how they tasted: PORTOBELLO FRIES- Lives up to the hype! My favorite from everything. I mean, where can you even get this besides BL? The whole time I'm indulging these, the only thing in my mind was, "Who invented these? I've gotta thank them." The baby of giant mushrooms and calamari with a side of godly dipping sauce.. accurate. ($10) HAMBURGER: It was a "meh" .. Though bigger than an Umami burger, I still would rather have an Umami over this burger. OK to miss out on this. ($15) 1/2 MUSHROOM & 1/2 BURRATA PIZZA: YES, you can order half and half. The waiter informed me this and I was pleased because I definitely wanted to try all their pizzas. 2 kinds is close enough. Mushroom pizza = perfect. I didn't want my slice(s) to end. Burrata pizza was good, at best. There is bitterness to every bite, which I'm sure comes from the rapini. But it works well with the prosciutto. I liked both pizzas very much. ($20) SHORT RIBS: Melts in your mouth!!!!!! SO amazing matched with the creamy polenta. I actually wish this was my order. My cousin was nice enough to let me steal a bite. Grateful for my moment with a piece of the short ribs. ($22) HANGER STEAK VERDURA- Uhm, yum. Another melts-in-your-mouth entree. It was a quality piece of meat but this plate is quite small. I'd order the short ribs over this, any day, and they are the same price. ($22) That concludes my food review. I was pleased with the service. Though the waiter leaves water (in a cute little bottle at that) on the table side, I never had to touch it. He would check up on us, as busy as it was, and poured water in our glasses, when need be. And for being there before 12, boy this place was PACKED. It is /very/ loud in there. So if you're looking for a restaurant to have a good, intimate conversation.. This is not the place. We were practically yelling to one another and we still could not make sense of each other. We obviously spent a lot more than $100 which is a little pricey for a table of four when you're "ballin' on a budget." But we paid for the service and the quality food. (And for someone who hasn't been and is dying to go to France, this may be the cheapest and closest it gets for now.) To add to the almost-200-dollar-bill, we helped ourselves in the bakery with boxes of macarons and a couple pastries, to-go. SALTED CARAMEL ECLAIR- Sounds better than it tasted. I was bored with it. That costs 2 salted caramel macarons and frankly, I would've much rather had that. HAZELNUT BROWNIE- It was a baby pie/ fancy brownie. Super good. Loved the crust! Overall, I will continue to be a regular :)

I'm not as into Bottega Louie as a lot of people are (as evidenced by how packed it is there all the time).  The space is nice an airy but way too loud.  You pretty much have to shout to have a conversation and even then, you might just end up listening to people at the table next to you who have outshouted you.  The food is a bit expensive, and I found the flavors underwhelming.  However, I love the pastries.  The macaroon are delicious and unique (albeit pricey).  The pastries are gorgeous works of mini art.  And the fresh baked baguettes and epi are some of my all time favorites.  The bread is what keeps me coming back, even though it can be hard to get service at the bakery counter.  There are always  lots of people standing around behind the counter, but for some reason, they never seem to see customers waiting right in front of their faces, or at least they don't acknowledge it.  Street parking in the area is a nightmare, but they have a valet lot.  If you happen to be in the downtown area, it might be worth it for you to check out to see what all the hype is about, but you''ll most likely realize that the desire to be hip is what drives this place more than the food itself.  If you stick to the pastries and bread, you won't be disappointed.

My sister and brother-in-law said we were going here because it was a nice restaurant and they wanted to check it out but, when we walked into the door, (which was straight down the 110, off at 6th Street, with a right on Flower, and then the first left onto Wilshire) it became obvious I had been duped. The reason they brought me to Bottega Louie was not to expose me to some of what LA has to offer--the Angelenos and their restaurants--but because I wouldn't cause a scene. With the tile floors and bare walls, this place is loud--too loud for even me to compete. You see, usually when I go out, people look over and say things to each other under their breaths. I'm kinda a spectacle. I can't help it, I'm loud and a little messy. Not only was the place loud, but the tables were topped with paper so I could spill and, had I thought of bringing them, busted out my pastels and drawn food-stained masterpieces. In all honesty, I was impressed by the place. We went for brunch; none of us were disappointed. The hollandaise on the eggs benedict was some of the best I have had--either homemade or in a restaurant. Not to acidic, not too salty, but juuuuuust right. And don't even get me started on the french toast! Great bread, perfectly egged. NOM! On your way out, make sure you stop by the pastry bar. That will save you from having to go back to appease your indecisive sister. May I recommend a box of 5 macarons. No matter the flavor, you won't regret it (okay, I can't say that for certain--I only tried six flavors) At very least, get a passion fruit macaron.

Cutesy brunch place. A bit on the pricier end for brunch but the ambience and service are top notch. I had the salmon Benedict and it was so good that three of the four of us dining all were happy we each ordered one for ourselves. Plus they have a dessert section and a good selection of macaroons.

Beautiful carrera marble clad interiors reminiscent of an old European saloon/cafe. All breakfast/brunch dishes are delightful and service is impeccable and kind. The colorful macaron display isn't only beautiful to look at, but a tasty treat chock full of time-traveling gilded charm; a true gem in this post-modern 21st century haze.

So the bf and I have been wanting to eat here for awhile now and finally decided to try this place out last night. After reading the reviews, I thought we would be waiting forever for a table especially at 7pm on a Saturday night, but nope! We were seated immediately :) Score! Our server was extremely friendly and always checked up on us even though it became very busy and packed in the restaurant. We started off with the portabello mushroom fries which were unique and delicious. It was the first time I felt I was eating something healthy that was fried... lol. For our entrees, I got the Trenne pasta (pan sautéed trenne pasta with braised prime rib eye, tuscan black kale & shaved grana parmesan) and my bf got the Pork Chops (w/ grilled onions & apples served with house made applesauce). We also ordered wine and a berry mojito (which was off the menu for $12... pretty pricey...). The penne pasta was interesting. I love how I never had pasta like that before. From afar, the pasta looked like sliced potatoes. I do recommend giving this plate a try especially if you like braised meats. The braised prime rib eye was cooked well but I wish there was more pasta... shocker! lol. The pork chops were good, perfectly cooked, but honestly nothing spectacular about it. For dessert we got the creme brulee and WOW, that was seriously the BEST creme brulee I have ever had. I devoured that in like a minute. :) Yum. Overall, I would give this place 3.5 stars for their food since it was a bit overpriced and it wasn't super spectacular, but I'm giving this place 4 stars for their service, wide variety of options (apps, entrees, alcohol, desserts) and the ambiance. Although I do admit it got a bit annoying having to shout across the table so my bf could hear me, but that was only towards the end of the night and by that time, I was so full it hurt to talk. Lol. At the end of the meal we went to the dessert area and ordered a box of 5 macaroons for $10. We tried the vanilla, Earl grey, pistachio, espresso, and shoot I can't remember the last one. But they were all so delicious and I love how they come in a cute little box. Definitely would be back for more :)

The Portobello fries are delish! We got a half and half Bianco and Burrata pizza... yum! Everything is made with quality ingredients and the flavor combinations are perfectly salty, rich and fresh. The Cherry Italian Soda, had too much creme, but still not bad. The food is amazing, but I think the atmosphere is beautiful and makes you feel like you are in a different place. I'm not a huge fan of french macaroons, but theirs are good! They are $2 for one, but super pretty. Their whole bakery section is gorgeous, love it! I want to go back asap :)

I love this place. The decor, the food, the pretty pastries at the bakery section -- and the food is just bursting with flavor. I stopped in today at around 11:40 AM with a friend that had 2 goals in mind: the portobello fries and pizza. While we definitely got the portobello fries, we opted for the waiter-recommended pork chop and brussel sprouts and also picked up the gazpacho for something lighter. All of it was amazing. But let me start at the bread. The bread is in a cute animal shape and comes with some very cold, very delicious butter. That butter. Butter. Mmm... And then came the food. Gazpacho -- sooo very light and refreshing, as a gazpacho should be. The crunchy bits of the chopped veggies just made the soup awesome. Perfect accompaniment for the heavier foods that we ordered. Brussel sprouts & pistachios -- nutty, deep flavored and amazing. Perfect brussel sprouts, sauteed/roasted with onions and pistachios for the kick to your tongue (in a good way) flavor explosion. Who would have thought brussel sprouts could be this good? Pork chop -- okay, the waiter said this would be the best pork chop you'd ever try in your life and I must say, it is the best pork chop I've ever had in my life (so far, I still am relatively young :D) It came with this awesome applesauce sauce that wasn't too sweet and complemented the moist pork chop perfectly. Portobello fries -- these are AWESOME!!! I love mushrooms and these fries are just yummm must have. That's all I can say. The mayonnaise sauce that accompanies the "fries" is well balanced, too. Yum! I just love this place and wish I lived in LA to try out everything on menu! I'll just have to do with glimpses of it whenever I come and visit :)

Perfect for people watching. Holy crap I've become a hypocrite. When I first came here over two and half years ago, I griped about the $9 arugula salad being a bit too expensive for salad but now it seems cheap to pay $10 for a small salad. Anyhoo, had a late night dinner at 10 and the service was pretty good. To the Monday night server (Emily?) with the T.S. Elliot tattoo, you are too adorable and can definitely sell ice to eskimos! The short ribs is a must order and so is the sausage pizza. The portobella fries were good for the first two pieces and got kind of lackluster after. I also liked the asparagus with poached egg. It's always fun to break the egg and see the yolk pours out. Almost as fun as breaking a creme brulee ooooor their chocolate souffles. I'm not a huge fan of their macarons but if you are craving macarons at 11 at night, it is the place to be.

While waiting for a table. I asked the bartender to make me a drink of his choice. He made me a clover drop. It was delicious.  For lunch I ordered duck prosciutto crostini and the lamb chop. Both were superb! Besides the food the restaurant decor was lovely, beautiful vaulted white walls and tasteful gold furniture. Great restaurant.

No wait during lunchtime! Started off with still (aka tap) or sparkling water.  I also had the green tea mojito (nonalcoholic) which was super tasty!  The bread (which was arranged like a flower/leaves) was super good as well.  Yummmm. The meatballs (small plate) were crispy and quite delicious!  My sister had the caprese salad which was filling, and I had the fettuccine (it was ok, a bit bland). I absolutely LOVED the violet cassis macaron, though!  It was bursting with flavor and cream.  The white chocolate and green matcha tea macaron was ok.

Yes it is a typical DTLA fancy fancy restaurant you'd go probably once or twice in years. But like many other say, it is worth it!! All the menu we ordered (mushroom fries, shrimp dish, and lasagna) were very very delicious. Actually I expected very high price but it was not that bad than I expected. I'd definitely recommend here for a good date and social meetings if you  have some money in your pocket. I'd love to visit here again soon, when I don't have to pay. haha :)

High ceilings, marble floors, & the simplicity of bare walls. The Food is great, dessert are daily made & the service is on point. However the level of noise is a big distraction... Not anymore. After several complains the restaurant has finished installing nonabsorbent materials under its chairs. The manager has said that they have also worked with staff to create a more relaxing vibe, including the music

My friend and I came here on a Saturday during brunch. I was nervous that we'd have to wait too long, but luckily the wait was only about 10-15 minutes. *The Smoked Salmon Benedict. I never get benedict because I don't like how the flavors taste with the english muffin. But this benedict is served on a potato cake. MMMM yum so good. If I remember correctly, this was $18. Also came here once for dinner. It's probably better than I'm aware of but I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as the breakfast. I got some marinara pasta dish...not so great. The portobello mushroom fries are yummy. HMMMM I wouldn't suggest coming here for one of your first dates. *It's so NOISY. When my friend and I came here, I had trouble hearing her from across our small table. Too loud for me. *Don't leave without getting macaroons! Macaroons are starting to get really popular and are popping up more often in bakeries, but I think Bottega beat out these stragglers. The macaroons have a good texture on the outside as well as the inside. I like the large variety of flavors. It can be pricy, but I don't stop by here too often, so it's worth it (:

Bottega Louie, this is really a 3.5 star but since your pasta is out of this world I put it at the four star. First, to gripe about why this place is not a five star. HOST STAND NEEDS BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! I came in with my manager and co-worker and they said it will be 5 minutes. Meanwhile, there are four empty tables. We wait five minutes, we wait ten minutes and then we ask, hey there are four empty tables, since you don't give reservations (why, that would make life so much easier!) can we sit at one of those. Host: Sorry, those are only for people with 5 people or more. Meanwhile, there is a buildup as 6 other parties of less than 5 wait to sit down. And it's one thing to be like, sorry, we can't help you, but these people were straight up rude!! They need to learn the some customer service in a serious way. But now on to to the food. If your in the mood for something light I recommend the: Modena salad. Butter lettuce, candied walnuts and goat cheese perfectly tossed with not too much balsamic dressing. This salad is absolutely declious. If your in the mood for some pasta I would say pass on the Trenne (unless you dig salty food, in case it's really good salty pasta) and go for the Orecchiette. I mean it's absolutely taste bud blowing good. They handmake the pasta and the romano sausage, just melts in your mouth. So yummy. I also here the Pomodoro is delicious, simple, and yet elegantly flavored with marriage of tomato and fresh garlic and basil. You don't like any of my recommendations above? Are you crazy! Okay, well maybe you want a pizza: the Burrata is decent but holy moly is the mushroom fantastic! (If you haven't been able to tell yet, I go here way to often and have tried way to many items on this menu) Also, besides eating all the delcious free bread twists that they have, I recommend the portobello fries with extra aoili sauce as an appetizer.

Aside from the ambiance, beautiful decor (loved the high ceiling) and excellent service from my waitress, the quality of food wasn't thattttttt great. Sadly, my experience didn't live up to the hype. :( Note: There is $2 valet parking around the corner. ** TOMATO SOUP - Not to sound harsh but it tasted like tomato paste straight from the can. The soup was just way too thick.The waitress was nice enough to let us exchange it for another dish (calamari). ** FRIED CALAMARI - Nicely prepared with a tasty sauce ** BRUSSEL SPOUTS & PISTACHIOS - Because I personally like my brussel sprouts soft and chewy, I felt they could've been cooked longer so the flavor can seep in. I wouldn't recommend this dish. ** PORTOBELLO FRIES - Bottega's famous fries! Pretty oily it's a must try. It's unique and appetizing! ** EGGPLANT PARMESAN - A nice veggie dish but pretty ordinary. ** LAMB PORTERHOUSE - Tender and juicy lamb chops, but I've tasted better. For whatever occasion, you should dress to impress when dining here! If you want to get a feel for what LA's about (the people, the fashion, the "bougie" vibe), Bottega is the place to go.

3.5 Stars: The Artichoke Pizza was just alright. I was very disappointed at the consistency of the pizza dough, very chewy, as if it wasn't cooked fully. The pizza bread was also very thin.The pizza had huge chunks of cherry tomatoes which honestly overpowered the pizza. I have had artichoke pizza at other places and was hoping that this one might just be as delicious as my favorite artichoke pizza I had in NYC at Chelsea Market!! but this one was a sure disappointment. I will definitely not be coming back for this pizza. We also ordered Portobello fries, which I must admit was pretty darn bomb! I'm such a huge fan of things fried, mushrooms that are fried, cheese on top of fried things, and garlic aioli sauce! It was quite delicious and I just felt all the calories and fat entering my body.. MmM! Of course I also had to get myself some macaroons, I ordered a box of 5, but ended up getting 7 because I ate two before leaving the place! My favorite was the strawberry. I also tried the earl grey. $2 is a lot for the size of the macaroons, but I must admit, they are one of the best I have ever had.

Lunch at Bottega Louie was magical. My party of 4 was seated immediately, and the service was quick. The portobello mushrooms were to die for! Highly recommended. The chicken parmesan was good (but how do you mess that up?), we tried a salad which was well done, a club sandwich with hard boiled egg and avocado that was spot on, and one of the pizzas. For dessert, the chocolate souffle is a must (in addition to the myriad of other treats at the counter as you walk in). I will definitely be back!

Finally ordered some real food here and not just the macarons so I can give this place a legitimate review. Started with the portobello fries (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…). The fries were very crunchy and the batter really locked in the juice and moisture of the mushrooms. Very flavorful. For the entree I ordered the trenne (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…). This was pan sauteed trenne pasta with braised prime ribeye, Tuscan black kale, and shaved Grana parmesan. The pasta reminded me of pan fried pot stickers without the fillings. I really liked the crunch on them. The braised prime ribeye was good but I wanted more sauce over the pasta. The meat also wasn't as tender as I'd like them to be but still above average flavors. Could do without the kale though, didn't really like the dry texture and taste brought on by them. The macarons here are pretty good but nothing extraordinaire and also more expensive than other places. One thing about Bottega though is that their gift boxes are always the best (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…). Place itself gets crowded really fast and is extremely noisy. Make sure to have reservations or arrive early.

Ladies and Gents, I found my second home! From the high ceilings to the simple, yet elegant decor  to the open kitchen, you had me at hello, Bottega Louie. Came here with the manfriend and Val D.! Havent seen Valerie in soooo long and we needed the reunion. We chatted, shared stories, ate and drank. Instead of being traditional, we had the macarons first! We only tried the rose and pistachio. The rose was very light and Ive had better at other places like Lettes in LA and La Bateau in OC. But the pistachio was a different story! It is by far one of the best places to grab a pistachio macaron other than Lettes. For some reason, the pistachio macarons seems to be extremely hard to get on par in OC. Val got the burger and it looked extremely delicious! I wish I took a bite but I had to focus on finishing my food and drink first! ahaha! Our waiter talked very highly of the burger, so I dont think you could go wrong with that selection! Plus who doesnt love a Kobe Beef patty? Manfriend ordered a pizza. Bottega Louie allows you to do half and half..which is great cuz then you can try different pizzas. I believed he chose the Burrata and I picked the Napoli! I immediately fell in love with the Burrata! It is absolutely tasty and hearty! Unfortunately I didnt taste the Napoli, but Val said it was delicious!! I trust her tastebuds. I ordered the smoked salmon benedict. This is seriously BOMB.COM. I have a slight minor obsession with benedicts lately and I couldnt have enjoyed this more. Let me warn you, it is very heavy! For this baby, they replaced the muffin with a potato patty! It was definitely a well thought out concoction! Although I wouldnt mind having the muffin because yolk+ muffin= soaked goodness!! I highly recommend and Im sure everyone who has dined here talks highly of their portabello fries. Now you dont see that often and if you love portabello...it is delicious, juicy and crunchy! MUST TRY! I noticed that everyone and their mom ordered the smoked salmon! It is definitely not your typical lox on a bagel!  It looked very appetizing and it comes in a rectangle..I know, riiight?? I believe it's a layer of salmon, cream cheese, bagel, and another layer and maybe another? Hahaha.  Louie were definitely creative with that one. Cant eat all these heavenly dishes without a drink accompanying it!!  French 75 was very good and definitely had its tang to it! Val and I got the Bellini and you cant go wrong with that! Of course I will be coming back here!!! Although I will need to make sure my wallet is plump and happy before I come here again! Great company! Great way to continue the 3-day weekend extravaganza!

Love this place! Late Friday night,  I had the chocolate raspberry tart with a cappuccino. The tart was a bit over-refrigerated, but the flavor was good. It appears that they make the pastries here, but it was a little tougher than I had expected. Anyway, the flavor made up for it. It was delicious and so rich. And, the raspberries were amazing! The cappuccino was strong... just like I like it. The ambiance is really interesting. I can't tell if this place is trying to be cool or upscale, but if you're a people watcher, this place won't disappoint you. All in a all, a really cool spot to stop by for dessert late in the evening. Oh, and the staff is super friendly!

I've been to Bottega Louie many times and each time I tell myself I will not buy macarons but it never fails that I am drawn to the beautiful display and I have to have at least one. Bottega Louis is my all time favorite brunch spot. It is so intricately decorated; being in an artistically simple room. There is a true sophistication where they pay close attention to detail like when the host/hostess address you as Mr. or Ms., as opposed to just calling you out by your first name. It is quite loud, but I think that's because of the intricately designed moldings on the wall which may play a part in the acoustics of the room. It is a great place to people watch, you see different types of people but mostly people who share the same passion of taking pictures  well presented dishes. (Mental note to self, ALWAYS take pictures before diving into the food, no matter how good it looks. I keep forgetting to do that.) My favorite brunch items are the Belgium waffles and potato pancakes. Yes, there is a redundancy of ordering two starch/carb items, but I love the combination sweet and savory. The Belgium waffles are simply phenomenal! They give two generous sized waffles with raspberries, blueberries and blackberries along with syrup and butter. The waffles are just the right amount of crisp and softness and the syrup provide a nice sweetness. Contrast that with the potato pancake. It comes with crème fresh, sour cream and apple sauce. The last time I came, the pancakes were a bit crisper than usual and there was a little more salt and pepper. But the crème fresh and sour cream mutes the harshness of the seasonings. No matter how full you get after eating, you cannot leave BL without visiting le patisserie. I bought two salted caramel macarons and a chocolate caramel cupcake which I took home. The salted caramel macarons are my favorite. The meringue shell is light and has a bit of chew. The delicate balance of salt and caramel is divine. The chocolate caramel cupcake is too pretty to eat, but like the macaron, the cupcake is amazing. The cake is moist with a salted caramel filling. The frosting is light and fluffy with a topping of sugar crystals that provides different textures of flavors. And, the proverbial cherry on top was a mini macaron. The cupcake provides the best of all worlds when it comes to sweets. Bottega Louie, you are too good to me, until next time.

I fucking love downtown la and I love Bottega Louie. Maybe it's a USC thing? As a life long westsider, I never gave much thought to dtla and it's restaurants, unless I was going to a laker game. Alas, since I went to 'sc, I discovered all the amazing haunts of downtown la. Bottega Louie is at the top of my list. The restaurant itself is gorgeous. Very minimalist and sleek, but not intimidating like many stark, modern places can be. Dare I say it even felt warm and inviting? They have a phenom wine selection and their food is to DIE for. I split a margherita pizza and the portobella fries- insane. Seriously. I believe someone else in my party ate the Kobe burger.. I don't eat red meat but it smelled amazing and they could not not stop talking about it. This spot is wonderful for people watching and the restaurant was packed at 10pm on a Monday. The only negative I can say is that it's LOUD in the dining room. I don't mind this type of environment, but it's definitely not quite and romantic in the slightest. Now, onto their macarons. OMG. OMG. The BEST I've ever had. They have unique flavors like Earl Grey, Rose buttercream, white chocolate & green tea matcha, etc etc.They were so flavorful and moist, but still flaky- absolute perfection. The display itself is gorgeous; I came here at christmas time once, and they had huge trees made of macarons in every color of the rainbow. I seriously wish I still worked in downtown so that I can enjoy the amazingness of Bottgea Louie more often than I am now.

Bottega Louis is a great place for family brunch. The prices are a little high but the quality of the food is good. Their portabello mushrooms are soo good. What i liked about this place was when you walk through the door you see a rainbow of macarons and also many wonderful lookign pastries. the dessert drew me in. i do like this place but with the pricy price i might not go as often as i wish.

If there was one restaurant that represented Downtown LA, it would be Bottega Louie. Once known more for crime, than nightlife Downtown LA (or DTLA for the locals) is experiencing a new resurgence as young professionals are flocking to the area for its cool lofts, hip new art galleries, and cutting-edge cuisine.   Bottega Louie helped lead the way into shaping DTLA into a culinary destination.  Stark white walls, a bustling open kitchen, a drool-worthy pastry shop with a European flair, Bottega Louie is a MUST for locals and tourists alike.   Weekend Brunch highlights include: The Ravioli - one large ravioli with a poached egg inside.  Could anything be more decadent? Lemon ricotta pancakes - could have been a little fluffier Portobello Fries - thick slabs better than steak fries Ahi tuna Nicoise salad - textbook example of an excellent version For Dinner - I could eat everything!  From the pizzas, to the pastas, nothing is bad. And the Pièce de résistance...dessert Bottega Louie's macarons are some of the best in the city.  With flavors ranging from English Earl Grey to Rose, the macarons are dainty little bites.  The perfect size to end a perfect dinner at Bottega Louie.

I was at the mercy of my team, which decided this was the dinner location after a long meeting. I immediately yelped it to see if everyone was on the right page and chose correctly.  The fact that Guy S shot out a 4 star review had me sold (That boy can REVIEW!).  Welcomed by a spotless baked goods section, which looked like something off of Rodeo Drive, not Flower Street, the presentation of each sweet was so carefully executed, I almost had to break down and eat my weight in marscapone.  But, it's LA, so it's protein and leaves for this dude.  I resorted to looking. After being seated, I realized that this joint was a total see-and-be-seen place.  Thank goodness I looked cute, replete with fashion forward Cole Haans.  I was accepted by the hostess without any fanfare.  Had I worn converse all stars, they may have taken my money, and then thrown my ass out. Austin was out waiter, and I do not think I have ever had as attentive, careful, and downright friendly service in LA - ever.  I had a guest who was using a crutch due to an injury (a real crutch, not a metaphor), and Austin graciously offered to hold it in the office while we dined. I had the diver scallops ($12) nestled atop sauteed lentils- delich! Grilled octopus ($12) over steamed greens - three words: ah - mah - zing! The Italian salad was very substantial, but I should have read the menu more carefully as it has chopper pepperoni - a big no no for me.   This place fills up fast, so I recommend enjoying it alone or with a chill crowd kind of early,while later requires a reservation, even on this Monday night.  Can you imagine? Parking next door was a whopping $4!  Bonus! Eat well and heartily as you will have to search far for such special food with such excellent service and desserts (so I observed but did not taste).

Equal parts hip, downtown LA eatery, equal parts celebrity sightings hotspot...love it when Laker game nights call for early dinners of Portobello mushroom fries (MY ABSOLUTE FAVE), gourmet wood-fired pizzas (try the Burrata!), and a smorgasbord of delectable house-made desserts to finish it all off.  I swear everyone and their mamas eat here on game nights.  Ran into Brad Goreski and his boyfriend Gary whom I'm madly, madly obsessed with from their reality TV show on Bravo (soooo much cuter in person by the way). The deets: Portobello Fries:  My very reason for even blogging about this joint.  Portobello mushrooms sliced like wedge cut fries, battered, and deep fried with aioli dip on the side.  Can you say A-FRIGGIN-MAZE-BALLS!!?!?  The batter is almost akin to gourmet zucchini fries, without all the greasy residue.  Slightly salted,  hardly seasoned, A PERFECT HIT!!!  Juicy goodness oozing with every bite.  Must order 2 for a party of 4.  It's that ridonkulous. Burrata Pizza with prosciutto, rapini, and reggiano parmesan:  With a massive wood-burning, top notch, floor to (almost) ceiling brick oven serving as the focal point in the industrial looking establishment, how can you NOT be wowed enough to order pizza?  Yummy, scrumptious, tastes like it looks- Fresh.  No complaints here. Club sandwich with french ham, turkey, applewood smoked bacon, gruyere, tomato, avocado, hard-boiled egg, and watercress.  Sometimes the mark of a good bodega is how well they execute a simple triple stacked club...Needless to say we ate it right up...along with their homemade thick-cut deli-style potato chips.  Straightforward is key here. Modena salad with butter lettuce, candied walnuts, crumbled goat cheese, fresh herbs, and creamy balsamic vinaigrette.  LOVES me some lukewarm greens.  If the salad isn't served bone-chillingly cold, you gotta expect that their dressing will be the icing on the cake and indeed this vinaigrette did NOT disappoint.  They actually had me at goat cheese to be honest. *Insider's tip:  My (2nd) FAVE macarons (next to Pierre Herme of course) baked fresh daily...get a box of 12 togo and sample each of their french-blended flavors.  Cassis ganache is simply TO DIE FOR and rose buttercream is pure heaven!* Bon Appétit my beauties!

I've been a macaron freak lately and on our most recent trip to LA, we made it mandatory to stop by bottega, not once, but twice! I was told that the restaurant used to be a bank space, so you could imagine how large it is. You walk into a bakery display filled with fine desserts and to the side there is a rainbow of macarons which are all uniquely flavored; Green tea, Earl Grey Tea and Rose were my favorite. From experience, come early, the good ones go fast. As you walk in further, there's a bar and a big story book where the host takes your name down as there are no reservations. The dining area is a sizable, heavenly space with high ceilings and tables spread throughout with a direct view of the brick oven where they make their unforgettable dishes. - Portebello fries were so delicious! and because they're mushrooms, I somehow felt less guilty? puzzling. - French Onion Soup is something you can't knock. Flavorful and cheeeesy. *slurp* -Short ribs - Very tasty! especially if you want a meat dish! served with polenta - Pizza w/burrata and proscuitto I would skip. I love both of those items, but on a pizza, it just didn't satisfy These are just a small fraction on their vast menu! They have free range chicken, usda prime beef and sustainable fish entrees and a TON of small plates to tickle your tummy with whatever it fancies. You should not leave LA without stopping by!! Again, don't forget those macarons!

the best Macarons I've had...ever! The crunch of the cookie and the soft, chewy texture of the cream and the cake as you bite down is a feeling that is just something you MUST experience for yourself. I also tried this tiramisu eclair, big mistake. Incredibly sub-par, bland, stale, and just plain WTF for bottega louie. Now I only come here for the Macarons...the god-sent macarons. You see how I still give it 5 stars, regardless of the tiramisu eclair fiasco? The macarons are that good...how many more times am I going to say macarons? Macarons Macarons Macarons Macarons..... A bit pricey at $2/macaron, with no large quantity discount (aka a box of 5 is still $10). But so totally worth it...I highly recommend: Earl Grey Tea (a big favorite), rose, strawberry, and passionfruit. Macarons

the pastries alone are worth the trip! Excellent atmosphere although it's not a place you should go to to have intimate conversations. The food is expensive but I assure you, it is worth the price. My friend ordered the orchetta pasta-very fresh and very flavorful. I ordered the torpedo sandwich which was served on a fresh french baguette. Very very good. We also bought beignets and macaroons which were all like we've never tasted before. I highly recommend the raspberry chocolate, earl grey, and rose macaroons! These people know what they're doing! Wish they had their own parking lot (that was free) but what do you expect? It's downtown LA!

I am only giving this place two stars for their macaroons and other treats. Bottega Louie might be the most overrated place that I have been to in LA. I was told how amazing it was by others, but I have yet to experience that (again, except the desserts and treats). I have had salads to soups and so far nothing has been mind blowing or worthy of even two stars. The food sort of sucks, and I have tried many different things. It is always crowded and extremely loud. Service has always been good, but I don't tend to rate on service because I think it is all about the food. Again, their desserts are to die for. Melt in your mouth delicious. Save your money and go eat and In-n-Out then hit this place up for some treats.

My experience could not have been better. I have a personal policy that discourages me from eating at a restaurant multiple times when I'm visiting, because I always want to experience as many different restaurants as possible. Bottega Louie is an exception. I would definitely be more than okay with coming back every time I come to LA. High ceilings, white columns and walls with minimalist decor inspire a clean and classy atmosphere. Upon entering the restaurant, you're greeted by the pastel pyramids and sea of rainbow confections. The macarons are delectable: perfectly baked, light with the slightest crisp and crunch, with the creamy filling that oozes with the designated flavor. I generally stay away from desserts because of my lactose intolerance, but I will wholeheartedly say that these macarons were worth the stomachache. I devoured a box of 5 before realizing that I had done so. The offerings at the restaurant are quite extensive. We ordered several small plates because we came for brunch and weren't looking for anything too heavy. The duck prosciutto (ONLY $8?!?) was divine. Rich but not heavy, flavorful, and sitting atop a bed of Moroccan lentils, pesto and perfectly grilled crostini. The bruschetta was overflowing with flavorful tomatoes, the gazpacho was fantastic and the ceviche was outstanding as well (decently sized chunks of seafood and mango). We also had the portabello fries, which are thick wedges of perfectly fried portabello mushroom. The prices are also quite fair, in my opinion. I'd love to come back to try entree dishes, because the small dishes blew me away. Service was great; our waiter was friendly, professional and very helpful. I guess we came at the perfect time (10:30AM on a weekday) because we were seated immediately. I really fell in love with this restaurant and raved to my fellow foodie friends about it upon leaving. I can't wait to come back and try more of what BL has to offer!

Despite the very large crowd waiting within the restaurant for a Sunday brunch, our wait for 3 people was not that bad, probably 30 minutes at most. Our eyes were definitely more greedy than our stomachs. We ordered a pizza, half sausage, half burrata. Big, big fan of the sausage, and burrata was pretty good too.  Definitely more than enough food already for 3 of us. But being the gluttons that we are, we also split a club sandwich, the portobello fries, and the Mache salad. And I topped it off with a green tea mojito. The sandwich nor the mojito weren't anything to write home about. I also wasn't a huge fan of the fries because it felt like too much breading to me, but I loved the Mache salad. Included all my favorite veggies/fruit, and the chicken was so fresh and tender, and nicely marinated. Our server Christian was on top of his game. Made a few jokes with us, though he was mellow, energy was always up, and he kept our waters refilled. I also got a box of 5 macarons to go. The earl grey one was delicious. I couldn't taste much of the orange in the mandarin orange with chocolate macaron, and the pistachio was decent, but could have used a bit more flavor as well. Have yet to try the other two flavors. Overall feel was classy, yet casual; somehow felt very LA. Very clean with all the white tiles along the walls. Food wasn't too expensive and portion matched the price. Food was hit or miss for us, probably should have gone more with our gut rather than basing our choices on other yelp reviews. I also liked how the host/hostess took notes on what people were wearing, so that when we were fetched to be seated, they came up to the right group of people every time.

When a restaurant makes a perfect cappuccino it's a sign the food is going to be killer!

Came here for dinner one night. The place is beautiful...you do feel like you're in New York. Everything is clean and well-presented. Our server was fabulous and the service superb. Food was a bit disappointing...it doesn't match the look/feel of the place or the service. I got the short ribs. Tender but a bit chewy/stringy on some bites. I got my daughter their pasta bolognse. Not as much flavor as I'd expect...texture of noodles were great but the sauce lacked depth. Macarons were still dry and not wroth the price. I forgot I had their macarons before when a friend brought some to me and didn't care for them... Perhaps it's because BL doesn't refrigerate their macarons?

Bottega Louie serves up a great dining experience. The restaurant is best characterized. as a trendy bar/restaurant with good food. Surprisingly, I found the aesthetics of the restaurant to be the most memorable quality about it, then, cocktails, followed by the portobello mushroom fries. I ordered pasta as my entree, enjoyed it, yet I don't think it was the level of cooking that warrants the hype Bottega Louie gets. I remember our server to be nice, albeit a bit hard to get a hold of b/c of how busy the restaurant is. Shamelessly, I'd come back just to be surrounded by pretty people, but not my first choice for dinner. Park at another lot, not BL's.

Anything less than 5 stars and you're probably addicted to judge Judy and cough syrup. Seriously, the macaroons are so good here they'll make you want camp outside for a fresh batch. But be careful, that's Ted's spot by the mailbox (or so homeless Ted told me). I love to hit up Louie about 8 or so, any night of the week this place is popping. I've never had the meal(s), only the pastries and whiskey (don't ask).   The service is fantastic, the ambiance is so classy I'm surprised they let me in, and the whiskey is strong (again, don't ask).   Great date spot, especially if you have a French girl who loves macaroons (it's a niche ).

After reading so many reviews that included the words "really crowded" I thought that going for lunch on July 3rd would be the way to go. The "day before a holiday" mass exodus was predictable and resulted in light downtown traffic and immediate seating at the restaurant. Score! The place is huge, you walk in and are immediately greeted by the most amazing collection of pastries and macarons. Now personally , I feel this whole macaron craze is much ado about nothing. I don't get the appeal, I've had them several times and came away unimpressed, a lot of flavorless sugary meringue with food coloring...am I missing something here? But they are a colorful collection and its the first thing you see, hundreds of them in every color under the rainbow, they really do look inviting. But alas they taste like air and one little dollar coin sized one will cost you $2.00..that is steep. The place is big and stark looking and yes, because it's all travertine and plaster, extremely noisy. By the time the place filled up I had to yell at my dining partner to talk and our conversation was filled with a lot of "what!?"s. But that was expected and it was fun being there. I had the linguine with clams and it was delish, a tad small from a portion standpoint but well seasoned. My friend had the chicken dish with artichokes and caper berries, she liked it fine. We shared a panne cotta dessert and it was very good. The place gives off a French vibe but I guess it really has more of an Italian thing going on,  the pizza was what I saw being delivered to every other table. They looked really good, smelled amazing and will be something I order next time. Parking for downtown LA is easier than I expected, there are two lots right next door,  valet at $6.00 or self parking for $8.00 (I opted for self) The staff is friendly and attentive, not pretentious. I'm already looking forward to coming back and trying a few other selections.

I can't believe I didn't review this place, I've been here three times. Never have I ever wanted to be in a huge, loud, crowded place so much. The desire might actually be unexplainable - there is no decor, just white Euro-style pillars and moldings, it will take 45 minutes to an hour to get a table on a Saturday night, and it is rrrrrrrreally loud. But everyone working there is so friendly, and you can watch the cooks cook, and while you're waiting for your table you can get a cocktail in a crowded bar full of people that appear to be as happy as you are to be there. What's the appeal? I think it's the food. The three times I went there I devoured my food. Maybe it's because you can talk sh*t about the fools next to you and they won't be able to hear you.
