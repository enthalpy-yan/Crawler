I would like to give 3.5 stars because it's loud in there because of acoustics on the huge hall and because the lighting sucks at night and there were a lot of paparazzi outside. What stood out is the portobello fries. They were extremely crunchy and not greasy... everyone in my party loved them. It was a new taste for me. We shared all our dishes... the ahi, a chicken dish with caper berries, clam linguine, spareribs, salmon cru, calamari and a chocolate souffle in the end. The ahi was room temp... 2 big seared slabs. So-so. The spareribs were very squishy. The chicken was a bit dry. They have latte art. Took home some desserts.. have not eaten yet. The service people who work here should be commended. They are really well-trained and mannered ... every single one of them and there are many. They are awesome. Would love to come back during the day... for those damn mushroom fries!

There isn't much I can rave about this place that hasn't already been said but let me just note that the staff here is incredible.  Not only are they real, comfortable, grounded, and honest - they care. The nice-looking gentleman who acts as floor manager (head host? sommelier? ) dressed in a lovely suit made it a point to check in with our large party (12) periodically as we waited.  We were quoted at about 1 hour wait, understandably, given that it's Bottega Louie.  We were fine, drank, mused over the beautiful pieces in the bakery...He would tap one of us on the should from time to time and just let us know, "We are working on it," or, "It should be soon."  How considerate.  How delightful and inspiring.

I went here last night. I did not try the macaroons, so I'll have to return, but the dinner was pretty good! This place is fun. It's super loud, so I would never bring my nearly deaf father, but it was a great place for a date. This restaurant is enormous. It was 9 PM on a Wednesday and completely packed. Mega hyped-up place. We put our name on the list and had a drink while we waited. The hostess said 15 minutes and that was about the amount of time, although I think she sort of forgot about us. Luckily, when we reminded her we existed, her apology came in the form of a nice corner booth. I had a Moulin Rouge while waiting. I'm not into sweet cocktails, but I had a craving, and this was so yummy! So I had another. We had... Asparagus & Egg: Anything with a poached egg is good, and the anchovy balsamic is a nice touch. If you don't like anchovies, definitely don't lay on the sauce. Prosciutto & Fruit: It's really hard to mess up anything with prosciutto. The fruit was fresh and delicious. Diver Scallops: I don't know about this one. I love scallops, but these obviously weren't the highest quality. They had a fishy taste too them- too fishy for scallops. A little rubbery. Duck Prosciutto Crostini: Yum yum yum. Chocolate Souffle: SO amazing. The waiter was kind enough to tell us early on that it takes a while to make, so it came out right when we were finishing our meal. Overall, I'm a fan, but I would never come here on a weekend.

From going to various bars in DTLA, I always passed by Bottega Louie and was intrigued by its architectural presentation.   I decided to come here on a Friday night to grab drinks with a gf and have a late night snack.  We got here around 10:30pm and asked for a table.  We got drinks at the bar and after a minimal wait, we were seated.   The first thing I noticed about the dining area was the high ceilings, white surroundings, and minimal decor.  It was pretty busy that evening, loud and vivacious.   It's a good place to people watch if you're into that.  Especially if the friend(s) you're with aren't being too talkative.  This also acts as a good date place for that reason, especially for those going on a first date.  Because of the atmosphere, you don't feel the pressures and jitters from a first date.   I ordered a caesar salad and when it came I realized I had to do some work.  The leaves were uncut-something that I prefer when I order a caesar salad.  It was still great, don't get me wrong...I just get a bit lazy when it comes to cutting my own salad.   My friend ordered a tiramisu and it was pretty good!  We didn't get to try to much more since we weren't too hungry.   It's a good place to start in DTLA to have dinner and drinks.  Around the vicinity of Bottega Louie there's various bars, so its something to do after BL. The thing I like most of Bottega Louie is the atmosphere and bustling vibe.  I'd definitely come by again and try more of their food.

Bottega Louie was absolutely delicious.  It is popular (read: crowded and noisy), but I can tell why.  Not only are prices reasonable, service and food are great. Sparkling water is complimentary - love that so much!!  My friend and I split a pizza and Brussels sprouts.  The Napoli was perfectly cooked, with plenty of cheese, and a firm bottom crust but doughy side crust - just how I like it.  They were able to do one half of the pizza with just olives, because I did not like the other ingredients (red onions & mushrooms), so that is much appreciated.  The sprouts were amazing.  No matter how I've had sprouts, I've never liked them until I had them here, and I like all green vegetables.  They were roasted and lightly tossed with olive oil and balsamic, plus pistachios. So, so good. Dessert was pure heaven.  It was the best strawberry shortcake I've ever had.  Plenty of strawberries, plenty of cream, and very crisp shortcake.  My friend's peanut butter terrine was super rich and delicious, and I don't even like peanut butter.   I want to go back to LA just so I can try more menu items at Bottega Louie.

An upscale feel at very reasonable prices! Looks good at first blush...they refer to you by name, have high ceilings with nice architectural details, noisy since it is all marble floors, absolutely wonderful service!, and great food/drink choices. 2 eggs breakfast awesome and filling - taters are wonderful. Flatbread was very good too, and a steal at $8. The Macarons are very delicious, light as air, yet chock full of flavors...and many unique flavors to try...but be forewarned, they are pricey at about $1/bite ($2/mac).   Scrumptious restaurant, will definitely return when near downtown LA.

I'm writing this assuming I have all the money in the world: IT'S FANTASTIC. But for all those other average people, this can really put a hole in your wallet... Anyone can definitely tell that the restaurant wants the customers to know that they are eating clean food. They have chefs in the same room, and the utensils are so clean you can see yourself in them. The food quality is very superb, and everything is super fancy and classy. It's a great lunch place to take your date...but sometimes it can amount to a $75 lunch for two...and don't think that your girlfriend won't notice those enticing macaroons located right next to the freaking door...because in the game of life--as Bottega Louie shows--there's no easy way out.

I still have memories of that moderna salad ($12). Perfect tiny head of butter lettuce with soft goat cheese, whole candied walnuts, saute shallots and drizzle of balsamic vinegar. Simple but so well thought out. This knife and fork salad is great as a light lunch and it's sweet enough to satisfy those who crave but want to avoid desserts. Also ordered the incredibly soft mussels($22) in a light tomato sauce made with garlic, peppers and onions and topped with chives.  God yum.  My favorite way of having mussels used to be in a white wine sauce but THIS is much better.  Served with a toasted slice of baguette to soak up all that delicious sauce.  I recommend asking for a spoon and drinking it a-la cereal milk style. Chocolate crossant ($3) was less flakey, more bread-y with the typical 2 sticks of dark chocolate in the center.  Blueberry tart was standard.  Simple two-bite fresh sample of their body of work if you don't want to commit to a whole dessert.  La vanilla creme square thing ($9) - that's what i call it cuz I can't remember the name - was outstanding.  Cool thick vanilla-flecked creme dusted with powdered sugar, topped with a red gelee and fruit over a cinnamon cookie crust.  Yes it's expensive but as soon as you take a bite you'll know why. Like the rest of the menu it's a well thought out dessert that considers flavors, textures, balance and quality.  One day I'm going to get the whole cake and eat all by myself.  Be damned the calories, I had a moderna salad for lunch. I can see why there's a range of reviews. Be smart about what you're ordering. Don't get something where it's specialized elsewhere (macrons, cupcakes, pasta) because chances are their price point/hype will sway your overall experience.  Realize this is a tourist site in a high traffic area so expect noise, $$ and a wait unless you come on a weekday during off hours.  Street parking is incredibly high ($4-$5/hr) so just park across the street at the automated-pay lot for a flat fee of $6.  It's next to the garage structure that costs a dollar more.

The ambiance is amazing. I love how beautiful this restaurant is, even the restrooms are flawless! Very open, beautifully decorated, loud, perfect reflection of Downtown Los Angeles. My honey and I came here on a Thursday night (after feasting at a food truck event and enjoying the streets of L.A, during the Art Walk) We walked plenty and got a lil hungry again so we decided to try this place. We sat at the bar/cafe area, it's self seating which worked out as we found a little candle lit table by the window. Our waiter was attentive and pleasant. Our mission here was to get dessert and try their Pizza! We ordered the Margharita pizza and added half mushrooms and half pepperoni. It was delicious the crust is thin and crispy, ingredients taste fresh, and just the right amount of cheese! Sooo good!!! As for dessert we ordered coffee and had their Macaroons of course! We also had the Chocolate Souffle, which was recommended by our waiter. It does take about 15-20mins to make, comes out freshly baked, warm, delicious, mouth watering! Goodness a piece of chocolate heaven. Price: Our bill come out to be around $50 dollars for all of this. Their prices are fairly priced considering the quality and location. I cant wait for my next visit here, We are excited to come back!

Great place! They don't take reservations, so get there early to get your name on the list. My only complaint would be that it's a very loud place. Not because of music, but the architecture leaves room for everything to echo. It's still delicious. They have great brunch as well as a deli area if you're just stopping in for a small sandwich or macaroons.

I saw some mixed reviews about the place so I wasn't sure what to expect. Nevertheless, I've been wanting to try Bottega Louie for awhile and made the trek all the way from the OC to eat here last night with some friends. When we got there around 8 PM, this place was rockin'. We all knew it gets crowded so no surprise but still, it's crazy packed and loud! We had reservations so we were immediately seated so no complaints about the wait. I really liked the decor of the restaurant - felt like a slice of NYC. We decided to order a number of small plates and one pizza (the guys wanted their own meatball sandwiches) Here is the review of the food: Arugula salad - 3/5: tasted fine but nothing special. The lemon dressing was a bit overwhelming and could've used some EVOO to balance out the tartness. Portobello Fries - 5/5: this was BOMB. At first, I was a bit leery to order this since I read reviews that these fries were way oily. My friend said they're really good and I'm glad I tried them. SO TASTY and JUICY and DELICIOUS! I love portobello mushrooms in general so eating them with a crisp, light batter made them taste 100x better. The dipping sauce is phenomenal as well. Brussels Sprouts w/ Pistachios - 4/5: the brussels sprouts were pretty good but wish they could've been caramelized to give them more of a sweet flavor. But, this dish was still pretty good and I could've eaten the whole thing by myself! Kennebech French Fries - 3/5: average fries but the waiter could've told us that a whole serving of fries would be served with the meatball sandwiches. Duck Prosciutto Crostini - 3/5: was slightly disappointed by this dish. I was hoping it would be more flavorful but the duck was kind of gamey/chewy and there wasn't much "oomph" to it. Diver Scallops - 4/5: these were awesome! Perfectly cooked/seared and very fresh tasting. I liked the lentil accompaniment as well. Meatball Parmesan Sandwich - 4/5: Meatballs were tasty and the cheese was delicious. The bread was too filling so we just ended up eating the meatballs only. Also, the meatball sandwiches come with fries so save yourself a few bucks and don't order fries a la carte if you order those sandwiches. 1/2 Mushroom 1/2 Napoli Pizza - 5/5: the pizza here is SO GOOD. I like it better than Mozza Pizzeria. The cheese they use is high quality and the dough is wonderfully chewy and moist. Fresh ingredients + fresh pizza dough = NOM NOM NOM. Btw - the mushroom pizza is loaded with garlic so if you're on a date, make sure to bring some mints if you eat this one! Overall, I loved my experience at BL and want to come back again on a dinner date with the husband! We know exactly what we want to order and will be back soon to do more damage!

I was in the area so decided to search for Italian and noticed this place was a big hit so wanted to see what the fuss was all about.    We arrived late and noticed it was insanely crazy inside.  Everything is white in side. Reminds me of a stock market company.  People were scattered everywhere...They were either staring at other people's food, looking behind the counter to see what everyone else is ordering. When you arrive, you have to go to the big boss and sign in this huge book.  You don't get a number so I'm not sure how she will remember me so my job is to keep bugging her.  It worked... After 40 minutes.....  It is hard to hear him here because it is soo loud and every one is talking.... As I was waiting, I ordered the chocolate cupcake.  I didn't like it at all.  It was dry, old, ....   Man, people are right about LA people. You have guys dressing like they are going to the prom or night club and you have the ladies all in heals, Vegas style / club clothing gear.   Please expect to dress nice here.  No sandals, shorts.... For late dinner, I decided to try the portobello mushrooms.  I didn't like it and told our waitress but she didn't seemed to care. I love mushrooms but this wasn't what I expected.  The lasagna was fantastic!!! Yeah!!!!!!   For the price, it was totally worth trying. Great density, flavor, thickness...

I was there on a weekday and ended up waiting 45 min for dinner seats. (They don't take reservations.)  It has been my 2nd time and I was hoping to write about some "must haves".  Still haven't found it/them yet....maybe I'll give it one more shot. The staff has been friendly & quite attentive both times and the people behind the open floor kitchen counter were working hard. One piece of advice:  Do Not expect to have quality conversation at this restaurant.  The place gets "Loud".  I assume due to the layout, but it is a beautiful space.  (Tall ceilings, large windows, open floor plan, white interior.) I do like that they have a dessert station at the front of the restaurant & have ordered some macaroons.  (I can't really say which maroons stood out either.....I may have to update this review later.)

I did not get my bread.....but it was  not a big deal Since it only took us 20 minutes of waiting time to get seated, and the hostess actually came to find us at the bakery to notify us that our seats were ready! We got the shrimp pasta, and the crunchy pasta ( which is definitely a hit or miss dish) We also tried the portobello fries, the chocolate souffle and the macaron cake. The pasta= one statement says it all, it was like pastry chef trying to make real food...it just doesn't work. I guess the pasta did not satisfy us that day, or it could be that we just ordered the wrong food. However, the desserts, they were godly delicious!!!!!!! The macarons we got afterwards were super good. Salted caramel, earl grey, and rose are among my favorite. I got a total of 10, and they definitely made my taste buds SOAR!!!!!!! My only regret was not getting more Macarons! It is a bit expensive, at 2 dollars a piece, but definitely was worth it!!!!

Desserts galore. Their macaroons are yummy! Try the salted caramel, matcha green tea, strawberry, earl gray, and pistachio! So yummy. The rose and lavender ones taste too flowery, but I'm sure there are some people who like that.. I also got to try their chocolate ($8)..The fancy white chocolate hibiscus..it was 'meh' The key lime tart was pretty delicious even though I am not really a big key lime fan-That's gotta mean something, right? Parking can be a bit* but...if you go at 10pm on a weekday, you can park in the lot right by it for free and just togo your stuff. perfffff :)

Oh, Louie. You're expensive and you're loud, but I just can't seem resist you. My friends think I'm crazy, spending all my time with you, but they don't know. They don't know. I've been here on several occasions, but lately it's become a go-to for Saturday brunch between myself and my culture friend who goes to see LA theatre with me. We meet at the Louie, down a couple mimosas, eat something amazing, and then walk it off (uphill, I might add) on the way to the Ahmanson Theatre where we will sit for two to three hours, depending. It's a good routine. Oh, and there might be a couple glasses of wine outside the theatre at that little cafe they have set up if get get there early enough...Hooray for culture days! But, I digress. Here at Bottega Louie, a shining dessert cabinet screams your name as you make your way from the front door to the host. Here there are servers with personalities...and dreams of making it big on the silver screen. Keep reachin', baby, you're almost there. Here the pizza is hot and delicious, and you can cover it with as much arugula as you want. More arugula, I say! Sure it's loud. It's a giant open room with a bunch of tables and people and clanging utensils, for goodness sake. But that's the thing. You want a quiet meal? Stay home, you deadbeat. You want awesome lemon ricotta pancakes, a Bellini and some chatter? I know of a place...

Bottega Louie is walking distance from my office so I do  frequent this place more than I would care to admit. I think the building is beautiful..high ceilings, white washed with crown moldings..it is definitely visually unusual and striking. The food is affordable, 2 people could eat here for under $40 dollars if they shared a pizza and a salad. I also like the fact that they offer you complimentary sparkling water (lets be honest..its club soda..but that works for me:) ). Two downsides: #1) While the ceilings are grand, they do NOT make for great acoustics. If you come here around dinner time or brunch on a weekend I swear you can barely hear the person across the table....the noise just bounces off the high ceilings and you end up screaming to a person who is 12 inches away. #2.) They do not take reservations. It is an issue.  While they do have a lovely Sunday brunch that is one of the more affordable options in LA, I refuse to wait 45 minutes for a table. If you are in the area, it is worth checking out, if not for their desserts alone (french macaroons! YUMMY!). But if you are planning a lengthy drive to come dine hear I would advice against it...or at the very least call ahead. Just expect during prime hours to be waiting 30 minutes to 1 hour.

Will come for starters and desserts only. The main was meh... One bite of the portobello fries and I was hooked so I had high hopes for the main but my pasta was oily and lacking in taste and texture departments. The chocolate souffle was airy and the chocolatey taste was prominent! It was dark and smooth. The waiting time was such a turn-off. I waited for more than an hour for one person. When I checked my name on the list, I was told I was next on the list but they never called my name till I checked for the third time. Boo...

Oh the well known and overhyped Bottega Louie.  You are lucky I gave you 3 stars due to your macaroons.  I was disappointed because our food that they gave out was practically COLD!  They either left our food out too long or they just really don't know how to cook it completely. Ordered: 1. Asparagus & Egg- Weirdly, this was probably my favorite dish.  It comes with a vinaigrette sauce that you can choose to pour over your asparagus accordingly.  Poached egg complimented this simple dish very well. 2. Meatball Parmesan- This came out pretty cold also.  I am sure the sliders would of tasted better when warm with its mozzarella. EH.. Disappointing 3. Pizza Margherita- Hmmm it looked good when we saw someone order it but then it was cold.. Cold pizza? really?! Luckily I had no time to spare or else I would of complained and have my food redone!! Absolutely unacceptable! I barely ate any of it. Desserts: 1. A box of all the flavors of macaroon they had!  These were definitely delicious and the thing that made this place popular since I kept hearing about their macaroons! I am glad I got to try it out. It is definitely a tough one to decide which places have the better macaroons!  A box of 13 came to $26. I noticed they also had a wide variety of desserts and pastries but I didn't get the chance to try them out since I was so focused on the macaroons. If you are in downtown and are in the mood for brunch, Bottega Louie is a place to try at least once.  There can be a line, but if you find a table near the bar, might as well eat there instead of waiting to eat in the back room. (boring!) Like I mentioned though. this place is only for their macaroons!

I know there are a million reviews already but I need to add to the pile. I LOVE THIS RESTAURANT. I love it all. Obviously it's crowded and loud. We don't take our parents because it's too loud for them. But we LOVE it. The vibe is cool. The food is insane. The apps, small entrees, large entrees and desserts are executed so well - especially for such a big place. We do love the portabello fries. I love the pizza so much. That's mostly what I want there. Last time we had the brussel sprouts. They were very good, but I joked "these brussel sprouts taste like lobster." They did because they were swimming in clarified butter. The macarons. Oh the macarons. The salted caramel macarons are ridiculous. We took a bunch home.

What a treasure in the middle of downtown LA.  I came here for both lunch and dinner.  I tried their club sandwich which was excellent.  It's a triple decker with the bread light toasted. They cut the sides of the bread to make perfect cuts when they present the sandwich. They make their club sandwich with the addition of hard boiled eggs which I typically don't see in most club sandwiches.  They serve them up with a side of home made chips which was great as well.  It had a nice crunch to it and the chips were lightly salted.  I also had the sausage pizza which was good.  It doesn't compare to that of Apizza Scholls or Ken's Artesian Pizza, but nonetheless it was good.  Their crust is thin which I like and not too heavy on the toppings which won't make you feel stuffed like most pizzas.  They serve a braided loaf of French baguette and butter with their dinner servings.   The ambiance is hip with high white ceilings with a traditional yet contemporary feel to it.  This place is especially known for dishing out fantastic desserts, mainly their macaroons!  Let me tell you, you can't leave this place without getting a box of their macaroons or you're seriously missing out.  It is by far the best macaroons I've ever had.  Very moist and the sweet filling in the middle is rich and smooth.  They have all sorts of different flavors to choose from.  I suggest trying one of each to start, then choose you're favorite combination.  The boxes come in 3 sizes: 1) 5 macaroons ($10), 2) 13 macaroons ($26), 3) 45 macaroons ($90). They place their macaroons into these cute little lavender boxes wrapped delicately.  They treat their macaroons like Tiffany & Co. treats their diamonds! If you've never been to this restaurant, I highly suggest giving it a try.  It may look insanely busy and it actually is, but the staff is excellent and efficient.  With what appears to be chaos, they have a system where the food gets out in an orderly and prompt fashion.  Although reservations are recommended, I really don't think it's necessary especially if you're a single diner.  This is a fun and vibrant place filled with a diverse group from the young and hip to the elderly.  This is a perfect place to meet up with friends for a nice lunch or a light dinner.  I'll definitely be back when I return to LA to try more of their fabulous desserts.

3 1/2 stars. I came here with my bf once for the first time and wow it was packed. It gets real loud, which I'm thinking is based on the construction of the walls inside seems everything echoes back and forth. I had some white fish cooked in parchment paper and my bf got some pizza. The fish was moist but a little bland. My bf's pizza was better but I was not a fan of the crust. I've tried their portobello fries which were good. Their deserts are endless. So much to choose from. I tried their macaroons and thought it was good until i tried lette macaroons, which was way better. I tried their cheesecake, which was quite tasty and slightly different from others. It had a taste of lemon zest, not used to that but it worked. It was light and refreshing. I would maybe give this place another try.

This place is always packed and loud, but it's definitely worth a trip whether you're hungry for a meal or dessert.  No matter what you order, definitely get the fried portabello fries.  The meat balls aren't tender, but their cheeses are fresh and melt in your mouth.  Save room for their beignets, macarons, eclairs and cakes or order them for take-out. Service is fast, friendly and helpful.  If you don't have reservations, there is ample seating in the lounge area.  Parking is tough on the street.

Located in the busy streets of downtown LA, this place fits right in.   The bakery side has all kinds of delicious desserts from fruit tart, chocolate donuts, macarons, and mini truffles.  I just had a rose macaron today, and it was a perfect one; cool, fluffy and tasty. For having a late lunch at 4pm, the usual busy place was calmer.  There were more open seats to choose from, but yet the place was still noisy from the echos of the high ceilings, the traffic outside, and the staff members rushing around prepping for their next rush.   This place is big, high ceiling, white blank walls, simple furnishing with gold accents  to keep the place looking luxurious and modern.  It's definitely not intimate or quaint, and if I had to complain, the hostess was slightly inattentive and rude. I ordered 2 small plates, Scallops and Brussels sprouts, the scallops was surprisingly  good, one of the better scallops I ever had.  The brussels sprouts were also very good, but It was too salty from all the butter they added.  I can taste the heavy amount of butter in all my bites, but I do love butter, so I enjoyed the taste.  I don't know if I'll ever order it again, but if you don't care about calories and such, I'd say order it.

I can easily see why Bottega Louie is ranked #1 in LA on yelp.  This place is lovely!  I love the simple decor and the classy, elegant vibe this restaurant gives off.  The service is top notch.  I don't know why there are so many bad reviews about the service, but we had a great experience!   The attractive bakery in the front  along with the display of cakes and macarons will surely win the heart of many girls!  The portobello fries, like everyone say, was amazing!  I also had the smoked salmon benedict and I loved it.  Even my boyfriend loves this restaurant, and he is a picky eater!  I also highly recommend getting the macarons in the front, especially as gifts to your loved ones, or even as treats for yourself!  I will really miss this place!

If you want to see some of LA's best looking people, aspiring actors/actresses, this is the place to be! I consider LA as my hometown, but I didn't capture the "LA experience" until recently. If you want to hear your conversations at your table, sit at the lobby tables. You get the same food and service, just the dining area in the back is more "romantic" and candle-lit. Portobello truffle fries are yummy, especially with the sauce. I had the Ceppo Gamber (shrimp, ceppo pasta, cherry tomatoes, broccolini, garlic, fleur de sel, cracked pepper, and olive broth) for the main course. The ingredients go well together, but I was hoping the sauce had more flavor. I understand that olive broth is light, but I like my pasta with more flavor. Of course I couldn't leave empty-handed without any desserts! The great decor and marketing strategies worked on me. Needless to say, I was suckered in with my eyes being bigger than my stomach. I bought 1 of each flavor of the macaroons. My favorite flavors are the earl grey, green tea, and pistachio. Bottom line, I would probably be back to people watch and of course have desserts too.

This place looks so grand and epic, it's somewhat overwhelming.  It's crowded and noisy.  Upon entering, I couldn't quite tell what it was, whether it was a restaurant, bar, patisserie, or a market place.  I guess it's pretty much all of those.   From the outside, the building looks almost like a fancy department store.  First thing you see when you enter is the patisserie filled with elegant looking macaron displays and other fancy pastry items.  They're definitely eye-catching.  Looks more like a cosmetics display at Macy's.  The decor looked very similar to Laduree in Paris.  To the left there's a bar and the restaurant portion is toward the back.  You have to walk toward the middle of the place to find the host for seating.   It was already packed around 4:45 p.m. on a Saturday but luckily didn't have to wait too long for our seats.  They give you complimentary premium water (still or sparkling) and bread & butter.  The bread was too hard and chewy. Most people seemed to be ordering the portobello fries so we ordered one as well, along with some salad.  The portobello fries were good at first but felt too oily and heavy afterward.  My wife and I split the Mache salad, which has frisee, small pieces of roasted chicken, avocado, celery, scallions, snap peas, Meyer lemon, and olive oil.  It tasted fresh but flavor wasn't anything over the top, and the portion was a bit small for $12.   After our meal, we went over to the patisserie and purchased one of the eclairs and a pistachio macaron.  The macaron was pretty good and the texture was pretty close to the ones I tried in Paris.  They are quite pricey though, at $2.00/macaron.   We may have ordered the wrong stuff on our first visit but didn't think the quality of the food justified the price.  For a place that serves mostly pizzas, pastas, and salads, I can't justify eating here on a regular basis for what they charge.  Their pastry items seem much more palatable.  Also, do not come here if you have a headache.  It's really loud in here due to high ceilings and all the echo.

Here's the deal: I found out about Bottega Louie on yelp a few years ago and decided to try it out. I felt disappointed that it didn't deliver as I was hoping. I wanted to like it though as I said in previous review. So, I decided to try it again. The same issues are there that I previously noted. The noise! My god the loudness of the place is deafening. Luckily had a good table that alleviated some of the din. The lack of reservations...Still frustrating. Service: Our waiter was on point. Genuinely friendly and helpful. Bus boys and food runners were on it too. The food and desserts: Pizza and salads are the way to go. Maybe some of the small plates. Plenty to choose from. And the macarons, pastries, and deserts are world class. I've had macarons from many places, and these match up to the best Parisian patisseries. So it gets two additional stars from me. It is loud though! But I have to admit I'm a fan.

Love it! Food is awesome! Service is highly dependent on the waiter/waitress. It's pretty much always busy, so there is always a wait and service is usually a little slow. Not the best place for a group. It gets pretty loud and even at a table of 4 for dinner it was difficult to hear each other.

5 stars for the macaroons alone. I've been to Paris and I live in SF (both macaron meccas) but Bottega Louie in LA is outstanding and probably the best I've had. You heard me - better than Paris!! The french can mad at me all they want but i believe it so. I love sweets so I would say that my palatte is definately reputable. Flavors I've tried: Earl Gray, Salted Caramel, Violet, and Espresso. All amazing. The Earl Gray is probably my favorite but only because I love tea. Try this place. Worth the wait in line. Its that good!!!

"Macarons are my favorite treat, two-bite bits of perfection with their candy colors and delicate shells that collapse on contact, meshing with the thin layer of rich filling for a light but sweet burst of flavor." The mister and I frequent this place during our many visits to LA. I've tried every Macron and this place is legit and worth the hype for these delectables. Sure, it's no Ladurée -- but it does the job and the macrons are decently priced enough for you to try every flavor if need be. But the food is mediocre at best. Minimalistic Design at best. Open and airy. Stark white building with some gold/silver ornate details. Think: Marie Antoinette goes shopping for a MacBook Air in an Apple Store. BRUNCH: awesome. DINNER/LUNCH, eh not so much. My Committing Carbicide Menu: Sparking and Still water is complimentary: So if the waiter ask you for sparking or still, don't worry, they won't charge and discriminate against your water discerning tastebudes - 5 stars Macrons/Dessert - 5 stars - favorite flavors: Vanilla, Earl Grey, and Espresso. If you buy a box, it is recommended that the box be finished in four days for optimal freshness. Portobello Fries - 4 stars - Large and thick, enough to share with 4 people. Eggs Benedict - 4 stars - Really light  and fresh for a dish that is usually heavy. Margherita Pizza- 3 stars - FAIL - had better Bloody Mary - 3 stars: Really, really spicy. Lots of tobasco. Burrata Pizza - 2 stars: FAIL AGIN. had better. French Toast - 2 stars - CAUTION: They give you enough to feed the Duggars. I think there were 6. SIX thick slices of french toast. Syrup and Fruit on the side. Meatball Parmesan - 2 stars - Regular ol' Sliders. 3 Portions but fairly large. All in all: Because I'm a sucker for pretty packaging (save the boxes for your little trinkets), unique architecture, visual displays, and desserts -- YAY. I'M A FAN.

Location: Let me start with the location, its not great. try to find parking near by, there are a lot of homeless people roaming around right outside the restaurant (they were shouting/cursing at us while we were waiting for our friends to bring the cars back). Wait Time, Seating & Noise: we waited for an hour our more even after making the reservations. If you are a big party, don't even bother going there because the seating is not comfortable. They try to fit big parties on very small tables. The place is so noisy that you are basically yelling at each other to have a conversation. The food: the food was mediocre. we ordered four different types of pizzas. They are not much different than what you get at other good pizzerias. The gazpacho was also not that great for $8. We ordered deserts and those were good. The macaroons are also really good. The portobello fries were really bland, with bland crust. Do not understand why others recommend it so much. Pastas are also very very bland The Service: Awful, the waiters are very rude and they looked like they were all not happy to work there. Overall, Not worth the money. Worth tying one time only. BTW we did see Kathy Griffin buying some macaroons at this place so it added to the experience.

Bottega is somewhat ??? Maybe I could best say that Louie is ... pretentious. I guess most people like the show, and sometimes I do to. But really there needs to be more attention to the guests upon entry. Instead one just wanders in and looks around, taking in all of the commotion at the front pastry counter and then looking around to be assisted by the staff. Then you have to waddle in and act as if you've been there before, and know what you are doing. Then after you've figured what to do, you wait around like a tired kid in line at the amusement park. Yes most things are decent on the menu, I really like their pizzas the best, while some of the other dishes are executed well, and some are not. Their pastries are good, but sometimes they are more pretty than they taste. I like to get drunk when I go there so I can tune out all the acoustics. Then the ringing continues when I get home.

I think I was just about the last person in the Yelping foodie universe who hadn't set foot inside Bottega Louie. Well, I finally checked it out for an early weekend brunch. From the food to the service, my wife and I had an excellent first-time dining experience. Here's the breakdown: Decor - clean, modern, and simplistic. I'm a fan of the bare, white walls and minimal look. It makes the food and dessert area "pop" that much more. Atmosphere - loud, hustling, and bustling. This kind of restaurant always reminds of NYC, which I love. Good to people watch and have lively conversation. Food - smoked salmon, lobster hash, portobello fries, and mushroom pizza. No matter where we go, my wife seems to always order the smoked salmon. The salmon wasn't overly salty or smoked, which is a good thing. The much ballyhooed portobello fries was as good as advertised. Light and crispy on the exterior, nicely seasoned, but "meaty" on the inside. The aioli served as the perfect dipping sauce. The shaved parmesan cheese was a nice touch and added that bit of saltiness to it all. We ate every last bit of crumb. The lobster hash was superb -- even though it seemed simple, there's an incredible amount of finesse and execution to make this a successful dish. There were about 4 morsels of perfectly cooked and tender Maine lobster tail meat. I sat with a view of the kitchen -- I saw them extract the meat from an actual Maine lobster, in case you're wondering. The Yukon gold potatoes were perfectly diced, and the two poached eggs along with the hollandaise sauce pulled all the flavors together. Here's the foodie geeky stuff -- even though it's not mentioned on the menu, they incorporate shavings of brussel sprouts in the hash. As a fan of brussels, it added a whole new dimension to the dish. My only complaint with the lobster hash was that the small portion didn't satiate my huge appetite (that, and plus I ran a few miles prior). I was still hungry, so I ordered a mushroom pizza. I was a bit skeptical about their pizza, but once I took that first bite, I was instantly in love. Fontina cheese, shiitake mushrooms, and a hint of garlic really blended well together. One of the best brick oven, thin-crust pizza I've had in the LA area. I credit my wife for turning me on to macarons. We've tried them at just about anywhere, from OC to LA, and at this point we have a pretty good idea of what really good macarons should taste like. Here, there are good sized, crispy on the outside yet airy on the inside, and they explode with flavors. They are some of the best macarons I've had. Service was on point throughout -- from the hostess to the waiter to everyone else in between. Everyone was friendly, quick, and efficient. Prices are sky high here, there's no sugar coating it. But for the food and service, I thought it was well worth occasional splurge. We hope to return for dinner in the near future.

I agree with the other reviewers that the MACARONS were a disappointment.  The flavors were just blah and the shells weren't chewy at all. That said, I'd highly recommend getting lunch/dinner here.  The PORTOBELLO FRIES were really good and the dip that came with it just made it so much better.  Surprisingly my favorite dish there so far is their BRUSSELS SPROUTS & PISTACHIOS.  Their MUSHROOM PIZZA was also really good.  I really liked the texture and flavor of the crust and toppings but the cheese solidified so fast. For dessert we got the CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE and it was yummy.

I went here on Sunday after allotting an hour to brunch location which took me only 20 mins to drive so had time to spare. Either it was way too early or folks were still sleeping from being out the night before. =P I wasn't joking when I said that I was on a mission to find another macaron place that could live up to Laduree.  I mean it was a hard job, but I knew I was up to the challenge.  So I checked out a 2nd location for macarons in LA - Bottega Louie. This place had great macarons and also is a cafe if you want to stop by for food. Unfortunately, the front of the cafe had this marble top that was very slippery that morning and I took a spill a la Carrie in the Paris episode of SATC. There was just no graceful way to fall, so I got up quickly, straightened myself and went about ordering my macarons flavors. =P They were delish but I think Laduree remain solid on my list.  FYI - the place need a sign on steps saying "slippery when wet" - very hazardous.  Keep in mind, I had flip flops on.  If I wasn't rushing to another location, could've been a possible lawsuit on hand, no? Lawsuit or no, the macarons were good enough to stop by for a sweet tasting.  =)

D-Licious! My friend and I went here for brunch on Sunday. We only had to wait for our table for less than 10 minutes. The staff is really friendly and professional. The food took quite a bit, but it well-worth the wait! They serve this warm, knotted, toasted bread (don't you love my technical terminology?) with butter and jam while you wait. We ordered beignets, which were deliciously delicate! It came with a side of strawberry jam, but it was totally fine by itself. My friend ordered the ravioli and I ordered the salmon benedict. It was so delicious - I ate every crumb off my plate! Of course, I had to get some macarons to go. I'm a sucker for novelty packaging, so I was ecstatic when I got my box, complete with a ribbon bow! Luckily, we found free street parking right in front very easily, but I don't know if it's usually that convenient. My only qualm is that it's quite expensive, but it's understandable considering the ambiance, service, and food quality. My friend said that the other menu is more expensive, so the brunch option is the only affordable one for me at the moment!

Must come back to try the rest of the maccaron flavors, eggs benedict, pizza, sandwiches, and meatball sliders. Mental note: Earl grey runs out fast so get them asap! Best time to arrive is anytime before 11:45am for a Saturday brunch, Ask for sparking water (it's free), Order a few smaller dishes instead of large entrees. Desserts weren't that memorable- plainly there for looks, maccarons on the other hand are their specialty.

Bottega Louie Review #4,050 so I'll keep it short. The boyfriend and I stumbled upon it after leaving the Library Bar. How could we not gravitate towards the high, bright rooms with a bar and a patisserie that was still open so close to midnight?!!! We got a chocolate hazelnut beignet, and pistachio and Early Grey macarons. The beignet was delightful, but the macarons were to die for. Perfectly crispy exterior that gave way to a heavenly, chewy interior with a rich ganache. I was seriously freaking out as I ate it because I couldn't believe how good the textures were. And of course because it was mind-numbingly delicious as well (especially the Earl Grey)! I'll keep this at 4 stars for now, but we're definitely coming back. I want to try their brunch, at which point I'm sure to upgrade them to 5 stars.

This is my chocolate souffle spot. Worth the 20 min wait per order plus the first come first served table wait. No reservations! I also love their pizzas and club sandwich. The pizza crust is chewy and tasty. Made just perfect. I'm a macaron lover and I would only give theirs a 3 star even though it is one of their best sellers. Its colorful sweetness is what greets you when you enter the restaurant. Each macaron is $2+ per piece. It comes in an exquisite box and that is what you are really paying for. It can get a bit loud. There is nothing in the decor that absorbs sound so I sometimes am compelled to leave right after I finish my food because it is impossible to hear my own voice when the place is packed and the music is blasting. Overall, a great place to visit in downtown LA if you like pizzas and chocolate souffles.

Came here after going to Sugarfish and leaving a little hungry. Pretty much got a wide range of desserts including some cakes, tarts and macaroons. While everything was good, but I wouldn't say it's world class or anything; the macaroons are no Laduree!  The lines are crazy and all over the place. A lot of the clientele later at night look like they're either going to or getting out of really trendy night clubs. It's also extremely loud inside. Of course outside you have a lot of homeless people as well. Just seems a little overrated. So it's pricey, expensive, loud and fairly good.  Would I go out of my way to come back? No. While I didn't eat dinner here, not sure I'd want to considering how tightly packed the tables are while also being tiny.  The 2 person tables are hardly larger then a pizza pan! Have to valet or self park at the lots next to it ($5 for self park) or find street parking.

Bottega Louie...such a great place to go with a date or a small group of friends.  It's quite loud and crowded, very New York like.  I've never been to New York, but this is exactly how I would imagine it to be.  You're immediately drawn in by all the cute little pastries because there's so much to look at and so many different colors.  They have a bar if all you want to do is drink.  The food was de-lish.    You must try the portobello fries, but I definitely recommend sharing this with at least 2 to 3 people.  We shared the lamb chops and lasagna, both really good.  Overall, this is an absolute must, you will not regret it!

The hubby and I popped in to grab brunch! The atmosphere is very pleasant, very chic with large vaulted ceilings, very european. We found flat rate parking next door, five bucks for the entire day. not too shabby! We were seated quickly. Everyone was really pleasant, we first got a bread basket with strawberry preserves! Yum-O! For our meals, I had the egg classic Benedict with spinach (im always in search of great benedicts), the hubby tried the lobster hash Benedict and we ordered beignets to share to come with the meal. My egg benedict was pretty darn tasty, as was my husbands, unfortunently the beignets came at the very end of the meal basically when we were waiting for our check because we were meeting our friends shortly after. So minus one star. Not sure what happened but I didnt want to make a fuss, so we ate it anyway. They were just ok. Overall this place is a bustling hipster downtown LA joint! I would come back to try those pizzas! they looked scrumptious!

I can't believe I waited so long to try Bottega Louie with it having so many reviews. While everything I've ordered here was delicious, my favorite things that I've tried are the portobello fries and chocolate souffle. The sauce that comes with the souffle is amazing and we ended up asking for a second gravy boat of it... The macarons here are the best of all the ones I've tried in LA. The earl grey macaron is amazing and I bought five of them the last time I was here. Besides the food, I love the decor--it's clean and bright with high ceilings and gold gilding. They have tons of pretty desserts and macarons on display in the front. Service is attentive and there are a lot of attractive waiters!

5 stars for the restaurant, 4 for the food.  by restaurant, i mean dining experience, atmosphere, sprawling menu, bar, decor, location.  great place to come with girlfriends or coworkers any night of the week or during the weekend.  it's bustling, loud, always busy, people watching is fun, there's usually a wait but there's a bar, desserts on display, and something on the menu for everyone. food i give 4 stars b/c while tasty, nothing is the best in its class in LA.  menu is divided into categories so you have salads, pizza, pastas, entrees, meat, and seafood.  the small plates section has like a million things to choose from so that's a huge plus. everyone talks about the portabello fries but they're really fried and as a result dry, covered in too much dusty parmesan.  try it once and be done.  salads are good.  pasta dishes are usually delicious.  cooked well and very flavorful. the tagliatele bolognese is one of my favorites anywhere actually.  oriecchette was good.  love the hangar steak. pizzas are ok.  sent the rubbery grilled octopus back.  earl grey macaron is awesome.

This place is trendy, loud, bustling with young faces. It is the epitome of LA dining. SMOKED SALMON BENEDICT: A+ SALTED CARAMEL MACARON: A- (I still like Lette's creamier caramel) Prices: Per entree for brunch is $10-$20 but dinner prices are a little steeper $20-30. With drinks and appetizers, it can be a pretty pricey meal but it's good quality fare. What may overshadow this is the ambient noise that can sound like a kid's cafeteria on busier days. Overall, I like this for the once in a while, group brunch. Not for a date or first time meeting an acquaintance.

This is the first time this happened to me.  The macarons are usually very moist. Hopefully this doesn't happen again because I love walking to BLouie for a nice/midday macaroon in DTLA.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.

I dont know why people think Louie is amazing but shot my experience here was terrible. Just happen to be around these neighborhood and saw towers of macarons and thought wow French reasturant/ bakery and thought of trying it. Weird that no host even showed me to a table, had to ask the bartender and ended up sitting at the bar. Ordered a slamon dish and it took a terrible 55 mins. for my plate to arrive in front if me. Salmon was cooked to perfection medium rare the way I like it and the sauce brought out the flavors of the salmon, a total of $45 dollars. Hmmm yeah wasn't expecting that. The worst part was by the end of my meal I left a generous amount of tip to the  bartender and a waitress came up running to me asking why I didnt leave tip for her and I explained I left tip at the bar for the bartender for he was the one who took my order and brought my food and checked up on me if my food was to my satisfaction. I was furious with this waitress and immediately  asked for a manager. Told the manager how furious I was with the service and the fact that this waitress gave me attitude with tip and gave me no reaction but  apologized and gave me compensation to come back free of charge on one entree. Like hell I would come back ever again, nice ambiance, great pastries and food but terrible service, just the worst!!!

This place is so busy I usually make a few attempts on different days before I actually have a patience to wait to get a table. I love the sweets, of course. They have great Crème brûlée but I can't wait till they bring their fabulous pecan pie back!!! It is the best of the best. Lately I started coming in for their bloody mary. Spicy and good looking. There is something about the spaces they use that says perfection. I tried the wild mushroom pizza last week. it would be soooo great. WOULD BE. If they didn't stuff it with way to much fresh garlic. And that says person who can't live without garlic....

Occasion: Dinner with parents, Soyongee unni, and uncles the day before graduation What I Had:   Trenne Pasta Portobello Fries Food Review: Small serving sizes! I don't know why I didn't realize this before, but for a $14 pasta dish, the portion size is rather scanty. Sure it's gourmet, but Maggiano's gives much larger portions for just as delicious food. Maybe it's higher ingredients costs? In any case, the Trenne was still great. I would have liked a little more sauce especially since the Trenne noodles are baked and therefore are a little drier. Definitely more sauce and less cheese. Service Review: Our server was friendly and helpful in getting the desserts we'd selected over from the bakery to our table. Venue Review: We parked in the paid lot next to the restaurant. My parents complained about how noisy it was in the restaurant, which I hadn't really noticed before because usually I come with such a large group of friends that we're the ones making the noise. Fortunately because we arrived around 6pm on a Thursday we didn't have to wait for a table as is the norm. Overall Impression: Great food, but as much as I resisted in the past, I'm started to think this place is a wee bit overrated. I will say that anyone new to SoCal should try it at least once.

An LA-4 stars! (Ever notice how everyone adds a star to everything in LA?) Anyway, a friend of mine took me out for a drive in the Malibu canyons in her sports car, so I invited her out for dinner. Driving really fast through sharp, blind corners has become a new hobby for her. She's even taken lessons at the race track. As she's driving, she murmurs, "Power power, brake hard, power power power," and I'm just, like, "Shit, we almost ran over the cliff that last corner!" But it was exhilarating (I almost hurt my hand grasping desperately at the hand clasp), and the scenery was quite beautiful, and she was a fantastic sport all around. She wanted to try out a new place Downtown called Mo-Chica or something, but that was closed. So we tried to go to Industriel, but that was closed. So we went to Botegga Louie, which is her default place to go. Never been there myself, but after a short wait, we were seated. I was impressed by how attentive and careful the staff was. For example, I dropped my napkin, and the maitre d' was there to replace it right away. Really, I should try this place a second time before commenting more in depth about the food, but what we had, I enjoyed thoroughly. The portabella fries were--as everyone's pointed out--very good, surprisingly rich and hearty. I had the roast chicken with spinach on the side. The roast chicken was very juicy and complicatedly seasoned and went well with the spinach. In retrospect, I would have enjoyed it more with either potato or rice, but I think they had neither as starch for it. But maybe I'm being old fashioned? She had the onion soup. No idea how that was like. But what we both enjoyed was the chocolate soufflé... You know I just realized this place has, like, 3009 reviews. You've read all about the above, I'm sure. Fuck it. It was good. Great evening. Nice day. Nice company.

This is just a well rounded spot to get a quick bite or have a girls night out before hitting the lounges/bars in dtown. Its conveniently located by tons of bars. Great for romantic dates as well as hanging out with friends. IT has a market/bakery inside. ALl white interior with marble floors. A bar with pretty good drinks and cocktails. The last time i was there, it was with a group of italian fresh off the plane. They approved of it! so we know its legit. Dress style: casual-trendy-classy-hip. Dont matter but i suggest dressing up! getting your hair done! men, put on your favorite shirts. The environment  is sophisticated and classy. Keep it that way :) Food: go with a group your first time! have each person order a different item. Then share. soooOOOo good. I forget what i ordered. Parking: i believe it was $3-5 and its right behind the building.

The only reason why I'm giving Bottega Louie two stars is because the service was great,otherwise I'd give it 0 star(s). My server was efficient and polite, my table never had an unused/dirty dish on it with out it being bussed right away. The food was BAD the lettuce in my salad was soggy and the pasta was no better than a frozen dinner. I think this place is HIGHLY overrated and too expensive for the quality of food.

This place is pretty pricey, but its worth it if you get the right things. Portobello fries are interesting in thought, but they are alright- a little over hyped. I can eat about 2, and then it gets too oily for me to finish. the kobe burger is good, but i added bacon and avocado and i paid 20$, which i think is quite expensive.. i couldnt tell that it was kobe :\ i had the clam linguini but it was ok. i thought the serving was kinda small, but i guess for seafood, $12 is reasonable. it needed more salt, because it was quite bland, i've had better clam linguini elsewhere. lets get to desert. wow. wow. chocolate souffle..if you do not eat anything else here, EAT THIS. holy cow it is probably one of THE BEST deserts i've ever eaten in my life, i dream about it, and when i'm done eating it, i want to lick the bowl and drink the vanilla creme. its rich, but not heavy, and its chocolatey but not overly sweet. the vanilla creme on top, what a nice, delicious touch, makes me weep, its so delicious. the raspberry beignets are  so delicious. its like a sugared donut ball with raspberry sauce, and I don't like donuts, but the sauce goes so well with it! i don't really like raspberry or fruit on my deserts but, wow. its tart, but not sour, and its sweet but not overwhelmingly so, its raspberry tasting, its light, refreshing, and so, so good. lastly, EAT THE SALTED CARAMEL MACAROON, its chewy, salty, sweet, its decadent, and dreamy- all the other macaroons just pale in comparison. don't leave without it. worth 2$

This place lives up to the hype. Monday lunch around 11:45am and it was fairly empty. Started filling around 12:30-1:00pm. Atmosphere: It is incredibly clean and fancy looking on the inside. Once you walk in you are surrounded by delicious pastries and an open kitchen and spacious tables. They also take your last name so that the waiters may call you politely by it. Super profesh. Food: They have the wonderful option of doing half/half pizzas. We ordered the half Burrata and half Bianco ($20) and also shared the portobello fries ($10) because everyone raves about them. I was afraid the portobello flavor would be too strong, but the batter around it definitely complements the flavor of the mushroom. The pizza is an 18" with 6 slices. The Burrata was good, but it had a weird spice to it that was a little too overbearing. The Bianco was light and fresh due to the arugula, and the breadiness of the dough compares to the likes of a new york style thin crust. My friend and I opted to share the tiramisu for dessert ($9). This ties for the best tiramisu I've ever had (refer to my Eatalian review). It had the perfect balance of espresso flavoring, and the cake was airy and light and adorned with fresh fruit. With tax and tip we each ended up paying $25. A little on the pricy side for lunch, but honestly doable for the amount and quality of food we received. Service: Our waitress Rachael (Rachel? sp) was so incredibly polite and funny and helpful. She knew her stuff and made us feel awesome for ordering such awesome food, haha. Also, on the way out we got a box of 5 Macarons for $10. My favorites would be the Earl Gray and Rose - I like tea and floral flavors. All the macarons were consistent in texture though, so kudos to them for that. Only downside is that you most likely will have to pay $5/$6 for parking right next to the restaurant or a block down. But even the guys in the lots are nice, haha. I'm definitely coming back.

Best macarons ever.  Better than macaroons from Paris ... seriously!  Food is good and place is open space with white clean decor in Heart of downtown LA...it is so crazy loud. I personally hate that.  Its ok if I'm just drinking but not when I'm eating dinner.  Best time to go is for brunch!! So much better than dinner.  Price is good. Have a parking lot right next to the building!  Good selection of yummy desserts.

I have no idea if the food here is any good. It was so noisy and hot inside at 10pm that we left, despite a projected wait of only 15 minutes.  Both factors, heat and noise, could be rectified, but apparently the management here doesn't care. If I was 20 years old and needed to "see and be seen", maybe I wouldn't care either. Alas, I am in my late 30's and actually enjoy conversation with my hubby. If you're in the same boat, skip this joint.   Maybe if I'm in town again on a weekday in the winter, I'd give it another try?  Not sure.

First of all, I'd just like to state that this is theeee loudest restaurant I've ever been in. Felt like I was in a bar. But its all good, I liked the atmosphere and high ceilings we ordered their pizza, half sausage, half mushroom. The white cheese on there was excellent. The crust was thin and crispy but also very soft at the same time My girlfriend got the ribs and it surprised the both of us by how tender it was. I don't think I even put effort in chewing because it just melted in your mouth. Amazing The one thing that really stoled the show was the the portabello mushroom fries. I don't even know where to start, because this has to be the best mushroom dish I've ever tasted. No need to describe it, just go and try it for yourself and you'll see We finished the meal with the chocolate soufflé which as pretty good considering it came with this cream that tasted like melted vanilla bean ice cream. Ughhhh taste buds were going offfff. And of course the macaroons were delicious. Maybe the best I've had. Better than Paullete's. Try the Grand Cru!

Macaroons in every color of the rainbow, every flavor imaginable - decadent desserts filled the cases -I could picture Marie Antoinette having a field day in this place! I had the meatball & mozzarella sliders, which where excellent! The fries just so-so. Everywhere I turned tables were plated meals that looked incredible. I must go back and try the pizza selection!

2 Stars for the restaurant, 4 stars for the desserts they had. The bakery at the entrance looks awesome. Huge spacious bakery with cakes, pastries, and of course, macarons. There was a huge selection of different flavors, and you can get them in nice decorative boxes, so they're great as gifts! The restaurant though...tried too hard to have an upscale ambiance and price. It was a very awkward clash of expensive looks, expensive prices, mediocre food, while catering to a very hipster clientele. It was loud and just felt too pretentious. Everyone raves about their pizza, but it tasted like your average california gourmet pizza... they just happen to bake it in the brick oven right next to the dining area. Clams linguini had an unexpected spicy kick, but pretty standard.  Bruschetta was served on fresh bread, which just ended up being soggy. The only redeeming thing was the portabello fries, which after much confusion, we found out was actually slices of portabello mushroom cut like french fries and deep fried. I don't think I'd eat the restaurant again, but I'd definitely come back to hit up the bakery and try some of their stuff.

Parking: Right behind BL there is valet parking for $6.00, easy, cheap, good! Service: We had a very nice and pretty server. She has a genuine smile and helpful. I think her name is A/Elliana. Food: Burrata Pizza - It was tasty, but a bit too rich for me. So the first few bites were good, and then I couldn't even finish one slice. Steak - The texture was very nice, asked for medium and I got medium. :) La Vanille - For dessert.. Really not my cup of tea.. I had one bite and stopped. Napoleon - Friend's dessert. I didn't like it, he didn't like it. Cappuccino - Yummy!!! Has it with skim milk but still very smooth and tasty. Macaroon - To go.. I have had their macaroon many times, never disappoint me! Overall the foods were average, but I had a good time there because of the ease of parking, good service, and the to go Macaroon for myself and friends made everybody happy. So I give it a 4 stars and I recommend just go for their Macaroon and not other dessert.

Ok, so honestly, either I didn't read the reviews closely enough or I'm just straight up crazy, but I totally thought this was gonna be some kind of upscale-ish burger joint, and I have no idea how I came up with that preconception. Forgive me. I went for the first time yesterday, and Catherine H. & I went around 2pm after a crazy night in downtown. I walked in and it was bumpin`. I asked her, "Is this the line to get seated?" and a very clean cut and well groomed host who was passing by said, "No, this is the line to get your name on the list." Wow, this place is really that popular? Heck yes. As everyone else said, portabello fries = orgasm in my mouth. Seriously, it was so good; I'm salivating at the thought of it. The aoili sauce is super rich and all together, they're a great combo. We also shared an artichoke pizza, which was very good. The slices were unevenly cut, so Catherine let me take home the largest slice since I couldn't finish it at lunch. I also ordered a raspberry Italian soda. It even had cream on top! SO GOOD! :D Service is awesome. Not only are the waiters and waitresses really attentive, but they're like also really good looking. Maybe because I'm pretty much always surrounded by Asians at UCLA, but wow, I haven't seen so many good looking, clean cut, well groomed non-Asian people. Seriously, I was just scoping out eye-candy everywhere. It's not like they're super hot, just very handsome and overall well put-together (maybe it's their uniforms that pretty much look bus-cas haha). 5 stars for food & eye candy :D I totally have a crush on all these waiters. wth LOL

I've been here a couple times and not once have I waited in the ridiculous line to be seated. Whenever it's crowed, I'm usually here to only buy macarons. Lucky me! To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of macarons because I think they're a little too sweet, but I really enjoy having one or two from here. Earl grey, pistachio, espresso, and salted caramel are my favorite flavors. The pizzas, portobello fries, fresh juices, coffee, etc. are all good, but I have to admit, it is a bit overpriced for the noise level and not being able to have a 100% relaxing meal. I've seen four people dine at a small table meant for two and they did not seem comfortable at all.

It's basically a giant white box that serves incredible food. Wonderful menu, insanely good desserts (I am still dreaming that butterscotch buddino). I had a delicious crudo, my friend had amazing scallops, we shared the brussels sprouts, I scared the fried portobellos.  A bit loud, due to the sheer number of people in the huge dining area, but all in all a convivial atmosphere. Excellent waitstaff, something for everyone on the menu. I look forward to eating my way through the rest of it.

The food- 5 stars. Generous portions, fairly reasonable prices. The pizza, though pricey, was certainly large enough to share. We shared a buratta pizza with prosciutto with a few of the small plates to share. The grilled octopus was superb:).  The ceviche was refreshing although the crostini was a bit stale and the grilled asparagus with poached egg was delicious. The service, 3.5 stars. This place is big and gorgeous. Very new York feel, like Balthazar's maybe. That being said, when it gets busy it's really loud and one has a hard time getting the server's attention. The service was good, when we got it, but seriously I had to do the "here's my credit card come take my money wave" and still it was a while before it caught the notice of  a different server, who bust up laughing before he came to get our check. Bakery- 5 stars. I love macarons and Bottega Louie makes some very yummy ones.  They are styling their bakery into something that is very reminiscent of Lauduree in Paris, but slightly less fussy, and slight more brightly colored. Very cool.

Dear Bottega Louie, Why did you change the English muffins in the eggs Benedict??? Were people complaining about them? Well, I certainly wasn't, but I am now. Instead of a light, perfectly toasted English muffin, its now a sourdough bread muffin with the consistency of a bagel that doesn't crisp up well when toasted, and is WAY too large. How are people going to have room for beignets for dessert after eating that giant, bready muffin? The Canadian bacon (which you also changed) takes up about half of the muffin now and just looks paltry on it, as does the egg. You could get two eggs on one half of muffin! Oh, and that frisée salad that you now serve with it, mine was WAY overdressed, and warm hollandaise sauce was running into it. After breaking open my poached egg, that ran into the salad too. Does that sound I LOVE this restaurant - I come here for brunch almost every weekend -  but won't be coming back if you can't fix the muffins on the eggs Benedict. It pains my to give only three stars, but I cannot stand when a restaurant makes a change to one of their popular staple dishes for no apparent reason. Sincerely, Your Biggest Brunch Fan

This place is super packed. We waited 15 minutes and was seated by the window. It is really loud in the restuarant and isn't a good conversation place but man the food is pretty good. Our server Pedro was soooo good! Not overly attentive but just enough and had good recommendations. Always with a smile when he approached us. Drinks: I had the Moulin Rouge (recommended by Pedro) and it was really good. I had 2 - more of a citrus cocktail but pretty good. My friend ordered the Ward 8 cocktail and said it was pretty good and also had 2. Each Cocktail is $12. Starters: Pedro recommended the portobello fries - portobello mushrooms cut steak fry size..and OMG - they were delicious!!! Best we had of our entire meal. We ordered small plates of -  grilled artichoke - it was ok, had olives and capers but wasn't what I had in mind and the grilled octopus which was also mediocre. The small plates we got were $10-$12 each. They are really small appetizers. For an entree we shared a clam linguine which was pretty good. Cooked to perfect aldiente pasta with just the right clam texture in a white wine sauce that wasn't too thick. For dessert, a recommendation of Pedro also was the Chocolate souffle a la mode with vanilla cream sauce. This was super devine!!! it wasn't soggy, just the right crispy texture on top and a perfect end to our meal. He even mentioned early on that it would take 20 mins to prep should we want to order it. We had to stop buy the dessert counter and order macaroons togo!!! 2 boxes of each flavor (14 flavors to be exact and the box only fit 13) so we had to taste the one that didn't make it in the box!! We simply had too!!! haha, it was perfect! 5 stars for dessert!!! I am sooo sure I will be back to try the other dishes. There is such a huge menu and variety from pastas, to pizza to sandwiches to entrees. Seafood is delivered fresh daily. Poultry dishes are free range. This is a must dine place in Downtown LA should you be in the mood for dessert after! Darn that sweet tooth!!!

Macaroons are too pretty/ sweet to eat. Just great to look @~ It was weekend night, really busy~ and very loud with younger crowd! This review is based on bakery side only since I was here post dinner. Ordered a cappuccino for myself which tasted okay, but once again, not extraordinarily good. Would go back to try their dining options but desserts are just eye candy~ way too sweet!

I'm rarely inspired to write reviews, but this place was just tooooo good!! I don't get why all these people are complaining about BL. Yeah it gets loud in here and people are initimidatingly attractive here, but I'm there for the food! Exactly what's wrong with their perfectly cooked Smoked Salmon Benedict with the oozing egg yolk spilling over? I'm grateful they don't use english muffins because I'll never understand why people actually eat such dry and tasteless things. And where else can you find such amazing Portobello Fries? I'm from SF and I have yet to find anything equal to those. The only thing that wasn't completely perfect was the Proscuitto Pizza. I've had amazing pizza from Cheeseboard Pizza in Berkeley, and BL's dry, powdery pizza dough just couldn't compare. The toppings were good though. I ended up ditching my pizza and eating my boyfriend's salmon benedict instead. Also, this place was packed when we came in for Saturday brunch on a rainy day. Wait was 20 minutes, so we just did out shopping in the bakery section. You MUST get the Earl Grey and Rose macaroons, and that chocolate peanut pastry thing (forgot what they called it) that resembles a giant Reese's peanut butter cup. It just melted in my mouth and I can never enjoy another Reeses. Oh, and people-watching here is interesting. Especially if you're not from LA. I'm not used to seeing girls dressed up in snakeskin pants, strappy stilettos, and fur coats for brunch on a rainy day...so I don't know if that's normal LA style.

I met my friends here for a birthday brunch, and luckily made it in without a wait.  They don't take reservations, and I've come on several occasions in the last few years, but never stayed because of extremely long wait periods.   This place definitely has great ambiance, with eye-catching pastries as you walk in, and lots of people, high ceilings and classic decor.  But the food... I was let down by a limited selection of entrees for brunch/lunch, and perhaps it was disappointment due to my anticipation of waiting a few years to finally dine here.   Our group was off to a good start with the portobello fries, which was a unique and tasty dish to share.  I initially had my mind set on breakfast, but my preggers friend and I struggled awhile to find something we both liked on the menu, and finally decided to share and split a kobe burger with cheddar cheese, and an arugula salad.  She loved the salad, but my first thought was "Really? This looks like weeds thrown on a plate."  The burger and fries were cooked perfectly and won me over.  We also ordered a fresh strawberry shortcake dessert for the birthday girl (with happy birthday written in chocolate on the plate though, they don't do complimentary birthday desserts).  Customer service was great overall, but I had to remind them for coffee refills quite a few times.   A very lively spot, Bottega Louie's sweet baked goods and chocolates can make great gifts, is a great spot to take out of town guests, and definitely a place you should try at least once.

Maybe we were there on a bad night. Maybe this place just doesn't do large group. But I had a HORRIBLE experience. First off, club music is blasting throughout that the servers can't even get your order. We were a large group of about 10-12, mostly from out of the country. The server wanted to clearly flip our table as she was quick to get our orders and was talking about dessert before all of our main dishes arrived. We were never once offered cheese or pepper for our dishes, which was definitely needed. I got the linguine with clams (or whatever they list it in italian) and it was the worst version of this dish I had ever had. It tasted as if they didn't wash the clams as grit filled ever bite. It also tasted fishy and lacked flavor. Everyone at our table agreed that it was the worst italian food they had. And apparently everyone has their macaroons, but I was not impressed. Some tasted like sawdust and others were chewy like a jellybean. This place is the epitome of LA and I will stay far away.

Hipster/trendy vibe, reasonable prices and no drama! :) I'd been hearing SO many great things about the food and ambience here and when I finally went I was not disappointed!! Bottega Louie has such a cute vibe of a dessert shop and casual/trendy place to dine. It gets a little loud because I think the building used to be an old bank, but the service is good and the food is GREAT! Pizza, pork chops, pasta...all good. I haven't had anything bad here! And of COURSE the macaroons and all other sorts of desserts are fantastic. The only hitch is that they do not take reservations for smaller groups, but if you put your name down and get a drink in one of the near-by bars, it's not so bad! Another great DTLA spot!

Ah, Bottega Louie, you're pretty awesome.  My friends and I went to Bottega Louie after seeing Book of Mormon at the Pantages.  Luckily we saw a matinee on a Saturday and arrived at the restaurant around 5pm.  Sadly, Bottega Louie does not accept reservations; however, we arrived just at the right time so we were seated within minutes.  That also gave me a little time to peruse the dessert case.  There's much more than just macarons here.  The restaurant reminds me of Extraordinary Desserts in San Diego.  Perhaps they inspired each other but the decor is minimal and the food is good.  It's also a FANTASTIC place to people watch.  I SWEAR that all the waiters here are wannabe actors or actresses because they are effin' beautiful.  It's like they did a casting call for their service staff.  Alas, it is Hollywood where dreams come true, right?  Our waiter was not only cute, he was awesome.   We ordered the burrata pizza, portobella fries, asparagus and poached egg, lasagna, and chocolate soufflé to share.  Sharing is encouraged here.  We also ordered drinks: green tea mojito, green tea Arnold Palmer, and coffee.  I enjoyed everything except for the asparagus.  It was a beautiful presentation but the dressing was not blended well and chunks of anchovy were visible.  I mistook it for shallots and bit into a chunk.  I was rewarded with a fishy taste.  Ick.  I loved the pizza with the thin crust and gobs of burrata mozzarella.  I really enjoyed the layers of lasagna and the portobella fries.  Our first order of chocolate soufflé fell flat and they had to make another for us.  Thanks to the host to stop by our table to let us know what happened.  We saw that as the evening wore on, the place got PACKED.  It was filling up with even more beautiful people, if you could even believe it.  Finally, our soufflé made it to us.  It is accompanied by a vanilla bean infused cream sauce.   The combination of the two is divine.  The dessert is definitely made for sharing too since I don't think one person should eat it all.  For the 3 of us, we split the bill and it came out to about $35 each.   We also wandered over to the dessert case and ordered macarons.  How could you not?  They run a steep $2 each.  I ordered a box of 5 flavors: Earl Grey, matcha, salted caramel, strawberry, and passion fruit.  It comes in a beautiful box and they can wrap it with ribbon if you want.  You can also place large orders for parties too.  They really do everything here.

A leisurely stroll on downtown 7th St. will show you everything from swanky hotels to roach motels, and swanky bars to divey bars. Along the way many are usually surprised by a break in rhythm when they see a clean white, floor to ceiling windows corner slot, fancy even by Parisian standards. That place, my friends, is Bottega Louie. This place always has patrons. From the outside, I always wondered where most of these patrons parked their Ferraris and Masarati's. Walking in one day, it really wasn't that snooty, kinda. I couldn't get over how WHITE this place was (the decor, not clientele!, kinda) I've only come in for desserts, so my review is of the dessert counter. It was the largest flavor selection of macarons on this side of the Mississippi. You first initiate by telling a guy behind the counter how many you want, and they'll grab you the appropriate box. From there it's point, point, point. I also grabbed a San Pellegrino Aranciata (my fave!) which was painfully overpriced ($4!). Fancy place, fancy prices. -=- Macarons -=- These clock in at 2 bucks each. No bulk discounts here, even if you are buying 2 dozen (and I've tried once). When these go down though, they are like soft, sticky cookies with a gooey layer. I really enjoyed trying the variety of flavors here. Sometimes when I am wandering downtown, I'll just stop by here and grab any 2 new flavors that I haven't tried yet. So far, my favorites have been the Pistachio (lime green colored) and the Grand Cru (dark red). If there's a better macaron place in LA, I haven't found it yet.

I'm very impressed by the service here. I love coming here because of the awesome food, and AMAZING dessert especially the macaroons. I finally came here for brunch with a friend and we waited about 10 minutes before we got seated. We ordered... and our food literally never came. Before we had a chance to complain or ask the waitress where our order was she came over to apologize for the wait and said it would come out shortly. A few seconds after she came over again with the manager and they apologized for the long wait and told us our meal was on them. This made me really happy! Who wouldn't be right? I suppose she probably forgot our order.. either way great customer service! This time around we had the breakfast flat bread and the ahi tuna nicoise. Ahi tuna nicoise was very healthy and tasty.

The interior is unlike any other restaurant. It kind of reminds me of being in a nice bank. It's really gorgeous inside. The food here was great! I got the tagliatelle bolognese, and the flavor was delicious, but my noodles were overcooked and not al dente. For dessert, I got the beignets. They were lovely, light pillows. But I would say to skip the raspberry sauce that comes with it - it was too tart and overpowered the delicate-ness of the beignet. The service was ok - it was somewhat absent.

My new favorite restaurant, absolutely and completely in love. Every detail is thought out and not only delicious but a piece of art. The space itself is grand (TALL white ceilings, beautiful architecture) and you are greeted by the cutest pastry bar (ever) with the most beautiful little pastel high quality boxes. While we waited to be seated I watched the salads being prepared and each one was beautiful and some of them were so fantastically constructed I would have been sad to disassemble. It had a bit of a throw back to the moderately fancy dining set ups you see in old movies, large grand space with bustling waiters and dull roar of voices. And the waiter greeted my hubs by name "Hello Mr Hanson" (nice touch, sir). We had the lasagna, pizza, burrata salad and Caesar salad.   Food. Was. Delicious.

A-Mazing!! Arrived with an appetite for a tasteful atmosphere, light cuisine, great company, and of course their Macarons! Their delicate, colorful, light & airy, freshly baked Macarons are like Disneyland in your mouth! Impressed with their spacious lay-out and high ceilings, miraculously accommodating the Sunday crowd. Their "open kitchen" is like a "behind the scenes" experience as you get to see the chefs create each dish and entree. One very impressive service is that when your table is ready, a host or hostess will somehow scout you in the sea of people comprised of locals, tourists, and out-of-towners also anxiously waiting to be seated. No pagers here! After being seated, our waitress arrives almost immediately with an offering of flat or sparkling water. I love anything bubbly so you can guess my choice at this point. The bread came first accompanied by this wonderfully light butter which tasted like it was just churned. We started off with the Portobello Mushroom Fries with aioli sauce...O.M.G!! Never had anything like it, so thank you my dear friend for introducing me to this wonderful creation! Loved my Smoked Salmon Benedict atop hash browns instead of your typical English Muffin. I wish I had room to taste test all the food ordered because my friend ordered a thin crusted pizza which looked really delish. My dessert were perfect portions given that I barely had room for more sparkling water! I had the Pistachio & Matcha Green Tea Macarons as a slight teaser. The Pistachio had traces of nuts in the creamy center. Yummy! My friend polished off his meal with the Butterscotch Budino and a cup of Chai Tea Latte. I couldn't keep up with him! As we made our way back to the front of the restaurant to order Macarons to go, I was abruptly halted by my friend who was so star struck he could hardly contain himself! Apparently, there was a female celebrity among us! Very Cool. Not surprised given how buzz worthy this hot spot is in the middle of Downtown Los Angeles. It's a shame Bottega Louie didn't exist 10 years ago when I used to work in DTLA just blocks from this location. I am certain my next visit proves to be as entertaining, maybe filled with another celebrity sighting! Plus I get to keep my pretty pink box that once held those delicious Macarons!

I really loved everything about this place and find myself telling everyone I know about it. Be prepared for a HUGE space PACKED with people, good drinks, great food, and good service for the number of people they're putting through this place. I loved being greeted by the hostess with the world's largest wait list/reservation book reminiscent of a scene from a rom-com as we waited for our table. We got in fairly quickly for a Saturday night, and got to ordering right away. On to the food... The portabella mushroom fries were unbelievably good... I still fantastize about these things, the way they were perfectly breaded, fried, and the mushrooms were just so good! The octopus was fantastic, and all of the drinks we ordered were incredibly well prepared and a perfect complement to the meal. In full disclosure, I would give this place a 4.5 due to the price (you're definitely going to leave with a much lighter), but it's certainly not unreasonable. I haven't had the chance to experience the bakery here, but I'm excited to head back and check it out.

*Review solely for patisserie* We arrived around 11 pm and luckily found seating.  I believe they do not take reservations and seating is on a first come first serve basis.  This place is huge and pretty loud (didn't bother me at all).  The restaurant was packed.   We ordered the following: -macaroons (not flavorful enough; for example, I barely could taste rose in the cream of the rose flavored macaroon) -butterscotch budino (terrible!!  Lack of depth, just creamy with an odd alcohol flavor.  I've also been spoiled by Mozza.) -salty shortbread topped with passion fruit infused chocolate (by far the star of the desserts due to the saltiness of the shortbread) We ordered one savory treat -- Portobello Fries were perfectly crunchy on the outside and married well with the garlic aioloi.   The pizzas looked spectacular and seem to be a great value.

Uh oh. I'm gonna get lynched for giving this place 2 stars. My girlfriends and I (5 of us total) shared 2 pizzas (the Burrata and the Bianco), 2 orders of Portobello fries, 1 order of calamari and desert. There was plenty to go around and we were all full. However!!!!! The pizza crusts were dry and overdone. The toppings were nothing special. The Portobello fries were good, but I've had better elsewhere (Jazz Cat). Same goes for the calamari. I was kind of disappointed, unfortunately after being hyped up about this place after reading Yelp. This was my first time trying macaroons. They were sweet, small and pricey! I don't think I'm going to eat another macaroon again. The wait time was roughly 2 hours on a Saturday night. I wish I could haul my TV to the restaurant and watch 2 episodes of The Walking Dead.

Louie's atmosphere is classy yet not intimidating at all! perfect for brunch! I didn't have their macaroons or beignets BUT i did have their lemon ricotta pancakes with coffee and a taste of their meatball sliders--both VERY delicious. The portions were huge and everyone's order around us looked delicious as well. This place has reasonable prices for a "ritzy" place. I would definitely recommend Louie for breakfast/lunch if you want to go to a reasonably priced place with a high class feel.

Parking is a bit of a hassle (valet in LA, of course), but it's so damned convenient. Walked in for lunch on a random weekday and was immediately seated. It's this expansive, minimal (yet beautiful) space that doesn't strike me as a restaurant, but it works. I love rye, so I ordered the Ward (rye whiskey, lemon juice, orange juice, grenadine, club soda, mint leaves). It was perfectly refreshing and quite tasty. To eat, the two of us shared a mushroom pizza, and there were still leftovers. I'll blame that part, though, on the fact that we also ordered a side of tasty, tasty French fries. We stopped off at the bakery before leaving and bought five random macarons.  Of the five, the one that stands out most in my mind was the Earl Grey (infused with milk chocolate). It was unique in that it definitely tasted like a cup of earl grey tea, but it was also sweet, and oddly delicious. The space is beautiful, the service is decent, and the prices are reasonable.

All i remember is "VERY VERY LOUD" (due to high echo-y ceilings) and "Awesome Portobello Fries". My friend from another country wanted to be wowed by fares from the recently revamped DTLA and i thought what a good opportunity to try Bottega Louie. On a weekday. Friend is a vegetarian and she found lots of non-plain, tasty options. Service was above par, and food is tasty but not worth the 1+ hr wait & higher end costs. i dont think i'll return as our voices were hoarse by the time we left (and I have a strong voice normally). I got mentally tired of conversing, almost LIKEIF SOMEONETYPEDINALLCAPSALLTHETIME, IT'DGETANNOYINGAFTERAWHILE. DULL ROARRRRR. for dinner (even weekdays) do an EARLY dinner @ 5pm, 6pm is pushing it. huge waiting crowd forms extremely quickly. no waiting area, everyone crowds like cows being round up, around poor patrons sitting at the small cafe tables. Im told there is a free lot neighboring BL, but i couldnt find it so I parked in a large free-after-6pm lot. 1 block behind BL through an empty walkway. Take home: fantastic Portobello Fries; OK Food; tasty/pricy macaroons (so many flavors); LOUD-CANTHEARFRIEND-LOUD.

Be still, my beating heart. These macarons are like a gorgeous gal... she looks pretty and tastes divine, but she will rob you blind. And yet, I continue to let myself be robbed. At $2.00 a pop, I always pick up a ridiculous amount of these sinfully delicious treats and refuse to look at the total before handing over my credit card. And so, I have a love/hate relationship with Bottega Louie. However, my favorites are the Grand Crux, Rose, Salted Caramel, Earl Grey, and Pistachio. I've had dinner at Bottega Louie and have tried everything from their margherita pizza, to the various pastas to their skirt steak. The entrees are not bad, but they certainly aren't mind-blowing. So I won't exactly go out of my way to dine here but I always make a conscious effort to swing by to pick up a lovely box of macarons to calm my insatiable sweet cravings.

I came here couple days ago with my bestie for her belated Birthday.  This place scores a four stars and the food images are great so I had a lot of expectation.  It's located at the corner on Grand Avenue near 6th st I think.  It looks like a nice place but a lot of weird people walking outside.   After entering, I felt really crowded and a lot of noises.  I thought it was just the front area and was thinking we have to wait in line for a table.  End up we didn't have to wait at all.  But again, it was really noisy and I wasn't feeling really comfortable about that.  I was hoping to sit somewhere inside and away from the crowd so I can chat with my friend.  We did but this place really lacks noise control and we have to scream at each other in order to chat .... bad.... The food was okay.  We had the mushroom fries which I think was really tasty with the sauce.  Then we had the diver scallops.  There were two pieces and I think it was just okay, a little bit overcooked I guess.   Lastly we had the claim linguine.  It was the most disappointing dish.  It was $16 and a super small dish.  I even told my friend that I could make it myself at home. It was nothing special about this dish.  Boiled small clams that I can get a huge bag from the market for $5.  Boiled Linguine combined with boiled clams, no special sauce what so ever. Overall, I would give a OK for this place.  The decor was unique and it looks luxury.  However, the noise really bothered me so much that I feel like it's a bad place to chat and chill.  My friend and I just really wanna get out.  Once we got out, we finally feel peace again...... We only brought some Macarons because everyone recommended.  It was good but nothing compare to the ones from the Venetian in vegas.  Heheheh~~~~

Wow! This place is very downtown chic. Industrial with wide windows, very tailored waiters,open space, and loud businessmen and women chatter during rush hour on lunch break. The ambiance called for a mix of louboutins and skinny jeans,coat and tie, fedora and flowy scarves, biker shorts with a side of messenger running late for his rush delivery. I think I just had Carrie, in Sex and the City, moment. Anyways, my girlfriend and I ate here for lunch, and with the help of fellow yelpers, I knew to get there before rush hour, before 12. We were greeted momentarily by a maitre d, and led to a table in less than 2 min. The menu was small, 1 page and offered little bites and entrees. The bruschetta was fresh, light to the palate, a great tongue teaser for my up coming entree of Roasted chicken, with pancetta, roasted garlic and herbs.The jus on the chicken was tasty, like I want to tilt the plate and sip it, kind of tasty.Not really sure if the $20.00 i paid for the sideless entree was really worth it.. I think I paid for the location rather than the meal. Dessert.... now we're talking.. before even thinking of leaving those double doors, pay respect to the pastry chef and tip him well... those desserts behind those glass cases are definitely worth the money. the macaron display case..heavenly. I paid more for dessert than my meal.. and with the rose water and dark chocolate macaron, those completed the bottega louie experience.

In 2011, I got notification from Yelp that I was selected to become amongst the Elite '11( first badge)  so I wanted to celebrate it and to come to the most Yelp reviewed restaurant and that is Bottega Louie. So I've made it a date night here with my wife to tryout the most talked about place in L.A. and speaking of L.A. as soon as you step in here its an L.Aish the crowd, the ambiance the nightlife, everyone loungin' and this location is in the heart of it all in downtown Angeles. Went up front to drop my name on the waiting list, the host asked if it was our first time here? I told him yes, then he tells me wait time would be about 25-30 minutes, thats fine with me I was patient that night, but man this joint was poppin' so much energy and vibe. During the wait we wanted to checkout their macaroons and their assortments of desserts in the bakery section. I'll tell you what?! lots of eye candy at that spot, dates and cakes also other stuff I can't even pronounce but it was the macaroons that I've wanted to try because I've never had them before,  I was curious of them I even looked up macaroons on wikipedia to see what there made of.  Dessert had to wait after dinner, so follow-up had to be a must. We finally got called up and we got introduced to our server. What's cool was that our server always called me by my last name during our experience , which was Mr. Belvedere like, that was pleasant.  I noticed the tables were kinda close to other guest, but hey this is place hip/elegant, ignore limited elbow room , focus on your grub. I've been hearing so much of the portobello fries , so that had to be ordered for starters, my entree was a short rib not sure (what they called but it might have a french name) and my wife ordered the Trenne which is pasta. Portobello fries were like crack man! whatever they put on this thing gets you addicted, and I thought McDonald fries had the strong stuff that makes me want more, these fried shrooms gave me the intense high. The short ribs were awesome! they were tender and marinaded it melts in your mouth. I don't remember too much of the Trenne it's worth a try, it may not be as fancy but it tasted just right, it does not have an overwhelming flavor. Dessert time, macaroons!!! Look into their selection, almost every color you can think of and what favors they can be. I chosed the Earl Grey ( the grey macaroon ) green was Limey, red for strawberry etc. etc. It was my first time trying these out, its sweet and it crumbles in your mouth. If your a local I definitely recommend this place, but truly it's a $$$ if your going the whole nine yards like I did: 1 starter, 2 entrees, a dozen macroons for dessert to go, this was one of those places that I had to spend out of the normal bill, but hey it was a celebration for being an addicted yelper what can I say?! This review is my 200th today...FTW!!! - they have a bar for those that want to lounge like R. Kelly and the PussyCat Dolls. - parking structure across the street, don't walk like a turtle, walk it hard before the crowd grows. - play some Modern Talking (youtube it) before you get here and sing along Brother Louie...Louie..Louie...you would love it, jam to it, enhance the experience.

I love this place, from just looking at the distint white building. (It's a can't miss building type of place)  Inside has very high ceilings and quite a bit noisy, it reminiscent of a New York establishment. The wait is pretty long, but worth it.. If you don't want to wait, you can always sit by the bar, they still serve everything on the menu Now the food... Salmon Eggs Benedict, a rich indulgence, probably not to good for you. Farmers Market Breakfast, very simple,  healthy yet delicious Portobello Fries, different. but very tasty. But lastly, Macarons.. yum yum yum  so beautiful too, my favorite is the earl grey. You must try this.

It's a loud environment tho... so don't expect a romantic dinner where you are whispering sweet nothings into each others ear, all night... more like yelling at each other hehe it's still a gorgeous restaurant with high ceilings and pretty lighting.

Beautifully high-vaulted ceilings, colorful rows of macarons, and a huge crowd of just about everybody and their moms. Yeah, that's basically Bottega Louie in a nutshell. We've gone here a couple times now - the first time we split a few small plates (which, although delicious, was not too wallet-friendly). In particular, I remember a delicious little ceramic dish of roasted lamb, seared scallops over a bed of lentils, and tender grilled octopus. Yum! The second time we went with a bunch of friends, so each person got a pasta entree to make things easier. My clam linguine was ok - typical white wine and garlic... the clams were a bit sandy. But MM's lasagna... oh that was heavenly. It was hearty and rustic and a deceptively massive portion. I kept stealing bites from his plate. Both times, however, we got the chocolate souffle for dessert. It rises perfectly with a crispy "crust" and a velvety and moist center, and served drizzled with a not-too-sweet creme anglaise. SO GOOD. Sometimes they'll remind you to order it in advance, but even when we forget, we are more than willing to wait the full 40 minutes as well (although maybe after the long wait for the table, we weren't fazed by the wait for the dessert anymore). Before rushing out the door, I love browsing the cake display and the rows of macarons enticing me to order a box even though I don't even really like them in general. Earl grey and rose are my favorites, although pistachio appears now and then as a pleasant surprise. In autumn they have seasonal flavors like cinnamon and pumpkin which are pretty good as well. What I don't really get is why the macarons are still $2 apiece regardless of how many you buy (they make it seem like buying the bigger box would be a better deal but it's still macarons x $2).

There are good reasons why Bottega Louie is such a popular restaurant. If you have ever walked or drove by this part of LA downtown, you will understand how extremely difficultly it is to look away from their gorgeously decorated display windows. Do not attempt to just walk in and take a look. Once you step into their patisserie, it would be impossible to leave without a hand or stomach full of macarons and pastries. Their bakery is popular and so is the sit down restaurant. Come here during regular lunch or dinner hours and you are guaranteed a good long wait. Keep in mind they do not take reservations and would only sit you when your entire party is present. The good news is that they do not close between lunch and dinner. To skip the long wait, simply come here for an earlier dinner or late lunch. Food was decent but definitely not as amazing as the look and style of the restaurant. Portabello fries is their signature item and is truly a must try. There were some good dishes like Clam Linguini and Lamb Porterhouse and a lot of average ones that are not worth mentioning. Their pizza was a slight disappointment. Margherita has good fresh toppings but the dough was too soggy in the center and partially burnt at the edge. Are you ready for dessert yet? Please say yes to the Butterscotch Budino. If you like salted caramel you will love this creation. How were the macarons, you asked? I really shouldn't review them because I just had Laduree's that very same day. Of course, everything was pale in comparison. If you must know, I think they were good but not great. Earl Grey and Matcha were the ones that stood out from the lot. I love the bright open ambiance with the grand high ceiling. It was a bit annoying how noisy the restaurant gets though. Not the best place for an intimate dinner but a fun place for a group of friends.

Botegga Louie has a great atmosphere. It's very modern and chic and  everything is nice, clean and white. The Margherita pizzas and the modena salad is really good here.  There macarons (which is the latest craze) is probably one of the best compared to other places that I had it.  Although, I don't know if $2 each justifies the cost.  I came here once with a friend after a drinking splendor at the local bars, and walked in and ordered 20 of them, and with tax it came out to over $40.  I felt bad that my friend  fought with me to pay for them, even though I ordered them.  What a great friend huh? Note: This place gets really loud. Not a good place to take a first date. However, it's a good place to impress the girl after dinner with the plentiful of sweets that they have.

If you've never been here, I suppose it's worth checking out once. The space is really nice with an all white interior and the patisserie part of the restaurant is infamous with the pictures of the tarts/cakes/and colorful macarons plastered all over facebook. I usually only come here when friends visit from out of town. The menu does boast many cool ingredients but I find things are a bit over priced for what it is. The portobello fries are a popular choice for appetizers; they are fried strips of portobello mushrooms and they scatter some parmesan cheese on them and it comes with an aioli sauce. It's a little too oily for my taste... But the amount is really small for $10. The pasta servings are good but I feel I could go to many italian restaurants and have great pasta for much cheaper. The best deal is probably the pizza. They taste great and are around $20. Most of the dishes LOOK amazing.... lol. Besides all that, the thing that bothers me the most is the service here. I understand it's a busy restaurant and perhaps there aren't enough servers or the sections for each server are too large, or the hosts just aren't working with their servers but my service is always sub par whether i come during dinner time, brunch, or even late afternoons between lunch and dinner....  on weekdays.  Many of the servers look like they hate working there or are miserable.... it usually takes a really long time for my server to come to our table to greet us... drinks are sometimes forgotten...  when they do come back to take our order, that's probably the last time i'll see them until near the end when they're poking around to see if we're done for the day. My favorite thing here has always been the macarons and I still think they are one of the best macarons but i usually grab one or two in a bag and just munch on them while walking around the area.

I've been here twice. Once, to try something that it seems that people have been raving about. Then, the second time to confirm that my experience the first time wasn't just a bad luck of the draw. Sad to say, I was not once, but twice completely dissatisfied with the food here. Sure, the atmosphere is cutesy and chic. Sure, the service is memorable, and the staff trained well to keep up with a customer's needs. But the food, the very crux of what a restaurant revolves around... is completely mediocre. I've had the mushroom fries, twice  (they're OK and pretty bland). I've had the club sandwich (it's a bad excuse for a sandwich by ANY standards, even if I was dining at lower scale restaurant). And I'm pretty sure I had some other thing before...but sadly it was so unmemorable that I can't even recall what the dish was anymore. Honestly, the best thing to do would to be to come on in, grab a few macaroons to go, and be on your merry way. If you're 100% invested in an atmosphere ONLY, then sure, grab a seat. But if you're expecting to fulfill any flavor cravings or want something that tastes good in any sense of the word, go somewhere else!

This place has a great atmosphere, hustle and bustle etc... Just a little noisy if you're doing the intimate thing due to the high ceilings and no soft furnishings. Beautiful decor and good service. Coffee is excellent and pastries are very authentic. The breakfast i had was good, classic concept. Good place to people watch in down town.

I absolutely love this place.... Sure, we had to wait for about 20 minutes before they could seat us, but my friends and I spent that time taking pictures and drooling over allt he food and the macarons. We were all like a kid in the candy store.. We had the most amazing server ever (Too bad I cant remember his name). He was funny and super helpful and we were all bff's by the end of the night! 4 people, 2 pizzas, one glass of wine and a bottle of sparkling wine = $21 each = Winning!!

This place BLEW my SOCKS OFF (if I was wearing any it would've.) Nona (aka my awesome amazing best chef EVER Italian Grandmother to hit the planet!) her sauce is SO CLOSE to this place! I SERIOUSLY wonder if the person that created the sauce recipe here is from the same village as my grandmother because it is like these two were nearly neighbors! It LITERALLY SCARED ME how CLOSE the taste was! Also........... Their FRIED PORTABELLA mushrooms MAKE THESE YOUR LAST F*CKING MEAL PEOPLE! Ok? OK. Done. 5 stars coming to an Italian place from a BONANNO. It's gotta be AMAZINGLY GOOD. This place is WORTH SPLURGING if you LOVE your TASTEBUDS! DO IT! Dudes take your lady here, you WONT be sorry! ;-) Ladies take your girlfriends here You will LOVE IT! Ciao!

I quickly rolled in on CicLAvia Sunday with my rollerblades so my review is based solely on the expedient yet quality counter service I received at my first, "drive-thru" encounter. I've seen the pictures, read the reviews, heard the talk but it wasn't until 7th and Grand was free from traffic that I was finally able to submerge myself into the divinity of sweets that were encased in the glass house at BL. I didn't know what to order, everything looked perfect as if all the goodies were in a photo shoot and I didn't want to mess up the wardrobe. I'm not a big macaroon fan and that case was gorgeous the macaroons were a myriad of beautiful colors and looked fluffy and filled with delight, but as I said, not a big fan overall so what caught my eye were the beignets. They looked perfectly doughy and air filled. I ordered a plain one just to give my palate a tease and not overdo it because I had some serious blading to do for the next couple of hours and WOW! My taste buds, tongue, and senses were dancing with delight. How could a plain beignet do this you ask? Well the dough was cooked to perfection. There was literally the most delicious aid pumped into that beignet that I had EVER tasted. I can't wait to go back for a full meal. I can't believe I rated this establishment based on my roll-thru and only tasting the beignet but that's all it took to win me over.

I have heard a lot of hype about this place. Every LA restaurant article I read, it has to say something good about Bottega. So the girlfriend and I and two of our friends decided to come grab some dinner on a Friday night. "Why the hell is everyone wearing suits?" I asked my gf "People who get off work at the financial district and came straight from work." She answered. Ahhh, so don't feel underdressed if you see a bunch of suits, but this place is definitely a semi-formal, smart casual place. These fockers don't take reservations because they hate you (or some other more reasonable reason). So first we had to wait in line to put our names on the wait list to get a table. That line took about 20 minutes, when we got to the front, they told us it would be a 45 minute wait, not that bad. We went across the street to 7 grand to grab a whiskey and came back. The wait turned out to be around 1 hour, but still, not too bad if you're with good people and you didn't show up starving. One thing I noticed very quickly in the dining area, it was LOUD. I MEAN REALLY REALLY LOUD. You will need to yell if you want the people at your table to hear you. The second thing I noticed was that for a place that probably had 1000+ customers come in and out of there today, it was pretty clean and sanitary. We ordered the Trenne, Bianca/Pepperoni pizza, octopus, portabello fries, scallops, and meatballs. Trenne was well done, the kale in it was prepared nicely. Pizza was my favorite. The crust was thin like how I like it, the cheese was great. Probably a full meal for 2 people, and if you want to go the economic route at Bottega, sharing a pizza is the way to do it. Meatballs were my second favorite. Well...it's a meatball with marinara sauce. Very hard to mess up and very hard for me to not enjoy. It's Meat....in ball form. Everyone in my table loved the portabello fries. It was deep fried, so I can't complain too much, but the mushrooms were a little bit on the paper side...as in, when you bite down, you don't get any juices that you woudl expect from fresh portabello. Octopus was disappointing. The waitress said it was the most popular dish on the menu. The portion was very very small, like, I can put the whole thing in my mouth with one bite small. And it was very dry and salty. I've definitely had better octopus. The scallops were the same. Very salty, dry, not exactly what I was hoping for. But from what I hear about this place, I'm guessing the octopus and scallops I received was the outlier, and they usually are cooked a lot better. I guess I have to come back to find out. Overall, a solid meal for the price of about $80. We went to grab some macroons afterwards for dessert and it was a nice cap to the dinner. Definitely not a first date place because of the loud atmosphere, definitely not a quick meal type of place. But a great place to go with friends and family if you are willing to wait.

I have never had lunch or dinner here, but the desserts- oh yes!  My faves?  Macarons...especially rose & espresso.  he macarons are expensive at $2 each.  There isn't a discount for buying more either.  They aren't something I get to enjoy everyday, so I don't mind splurging once in awhile.  Also, the orange cupcake is light & mildly sweet with a tart center & teeny macaron garnish and it is well priced at $2.50.  The marshmallows are like little square clouds of perfection.  Blood orange panna cotta is yummy.   Something I'm not a fan of is the parking.  Street parking can be hard to find most of the time.  If you are running in to buy a few things at the dessert counter, it is kind of a waste to pay for parking in a lot.  Anyway, try the sweets, you won't be disappointed!

I walk pass this place everyday! its on the way to school so it just teases me whenever i pass by it at first i never noticed it. i would walk by the area and didnt even realize what this place was until i actually looked into the windows... i swear i stood there for a good minute drooling over the abundance of colorful macrons and the amazing looking desserts! One afternoon after me and a friend got back from a shoot she asked if i was hungry and right away i recommended we go here! Right when you walk in you see the dessert bar and i seriously had to take a picture because it just looked amazing. but then the waiter called to seat us so i had to peel away haha I ordered the cepo gamber and she ordered the fettucini belmondo. during the wait our waiter came out with this pretty interesting piece of bread but it was pretty good. then our food came out and it was time to eat! my plate of pasta looked really good, i love seafood so the shrimp was the first thing i ate haha. The presentation wasnt neat. it had some sauce around the brim but who looks at that really? haha. my friend didnt really enjoy her food though. her pasta wasnt all the way cooked so it kinda stuck together and was tough. so she ate what she could and just pushed it aside. for dessert we shared le grand macron. the berries were fresh and the macron was really good. the regular ones are smaller than the ones i was used to back home and a little more expensive but they were really good too I like this place. its fancy without being stuffy. they should do something to their walls though. the high white walls makes it feel really cold. i'll definitely be coming back again soon!

This place is still hot and happening.  I love the atmosphere and the gorgeous bakery.  The food really is just A-OK but the glam factor bumps Bottega Louie up to 4 stars.   I actually had the chance to visit two meals in a row:  Dinner one night and brunch the next morning.  For dinner I had the bolognese (it was okay) and for brunch I had the waffles (these were pretty good).  A friend had the lemon ricotta pancakes - I tasted them and they were just okay.  However, presentation of the food is always beautiful. The service was good both times. Parking is pretty easy - just use the surface lots. Lots of gorgeous men hanging around on a Friday night so I'm sure that I will go back....

WHY ARE THEIR MACARONS SO EXPENSIVE? Oh well. That didn't stop me...haha. If you're buying macarons: definitely get the Violet Cassis (purple). Sounds weird, but it was soooooooooooo good, like heaven in your mouth. The ganache was sweet but tangy. I think cassis is like a black currant creme. (But..who cares. That ish is GOOD.)  Not very fond of Earl Gray because I'm not too into chocolate, but the gold flakes attracted my attention! Next time I come here, I'll definitely be eating for dinner!

People rave about Bottega Louie's ambiance but stark white walls and a noise level on par with a junior high school gymnasium did not seem fantastic to me. Nor was my meal off the brunch menu. The best thing I could say about Bottega Louie is that the French toast was decent. The eggs Benedict with smoked salmon sounded good, and was recommended by our server. To me, it was disappointing. By comparison, I recently had the smoked salmon as part of my breakfast at Wicked Spoon in Las Vegas. In fact, that positive breakfast experience influenced my order here. In the end, Bottega Louie turned out to be a significant let down. Finally, I understand the austere look management is going for but not at the expense of being able to hear the person you are sitting beside. Hanging a few pictures would go a long way towards reining in the noise level.

Been here twice.  The first time, Emily (works Wednesdays and Thursdays) was perfect.  The Trenne was perfect, the pizza was yummers, the portobello fries and aoli were amazing.  Espresso gelato and pear tart were fantastic...the wine flowed beautifully.  Best service in a looong time.  We were her closing table, and she was beyond patient!  Emily...12 stars.  I went back...different server, he didn't talk, food was okay, less than mediocre service, didn't have much opinion.

I love the dessert bar (4 stars), I do not love the actual dinning (2 stars), so I'm balancing them out with 3 stars. Yes the portobello fries are bomb, yes the chocolate souffle is good (you can get THE BEST souffle at Arroyo Chop House), but the rest of the food here do not impress me. I first went there when they first opened over 2 years ago. Even back when this place wasn't so popular, it was extremely loud. The restaurant is basically a huge ground floor loft with cooking and pizza making and bar talk and dinner convo all mixed up and bouncing against the walls. It was heard to even hear myself, let alone anyone else. the pizzas were ok, for the price we paid, it should've been superb. The steak was good, but they sliced it thinly and laid the steak out on a long plate to give me the illusion that it's a big steak, when really the actual steak probably would've taken up 1/3 of that plate. The soups were very average. The chocolate peanut butter terrine was too rich, and how it this even a dessert at a semi-upscale place like this? I just make this at home with peanut butter, melted choclate and heavy cream. You're charging me over $10 for this? Com'on. I went a few other times in between but only when friends want to go. It's my most recent visit that really prompt this review. A few weeks ago me and a friend went for dinner on a Sunday. The place was a little less packed then usual and our waitress made a big fuss about how she LOVES eating here even though she works here too. I read the yelp reviews, we order. The portobello fries, the trenne, the lasagna, the souffle. I have to talk about the trenne here because it was so much worse than I expected to be. This is supposedly one of there most popular dishes, but the pasta was undercooked on the "soft" side and burnt on the "crispy" side. It wasn't yummy, it was chewy. The braised beef was extremely dry and I can't believe I'm going to say this, but they braised it for too long I think (I didn't think there's such a thing as braised too long before...). The kale was the only highlight, but leaves are just leaves. I don't know why this place is so popular, maybe they make great cocktails or something. I don't get it. If I come back, it'll be for the dessert bar only.

Onion soup is meh. Love the generous helping prosciutto on the burrata pizza. Artichoke pizza ain't bad as well. If you're looking for something more on the pasta side, the ceppo gamber is full of nommy shrimp and isn't too heavy. Place is still loud as ever, even on a Tuesday night. Macarons are $2 a pop O_O

Delicious pizza at a classy restaurant? Yes, please! I came here for my birthday last weekend and had a blast. Great service, too! Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to try any of their baked goods (which they're known for...), but I plan on returning here for another go-around. The location is convenient for USC students who want to explore downtown and go somewhere fancy... My only suggestion is to plan for a long wait most evenings.

Loud. Very loud. This restaurant gets extremely loud during peak hours. Their food is alright. My eggs benedict was a little too cold when it was served to me. I had ordered a side of thick bacons which did not impress me with its tough texture. The bacons felt a little overcooked too. Maybe they need to revise their processes so that food gets delivered to your table right after they are actually cooked. Pizzas are not very good either. I'd rather go to that Italian pizza place in Ktown. One dish that saves this place is the portobello fries. It's very enjoyable with its crunchy outside with the soft mushroom inside. When you bite into it, a nice amount of juice comes out. The sauce complements the fries. Some of the macaroons are nice but overpriced. If you dig loud restaurants, this might work for you. The interior is nice, and the food is whatever.

Went on a Sunday night and it was very busy but my friends and I sat at the bar and had a couple of very delicious cocktails and within a few minutes we were seated. The atmosphere is chic and loud, so I wouldn't recommend bringing children. The service was great and the food was amazing.  I recommend the appetizer  asparagus with poached egg- yummy!  Tomato soup was rockin, and if you like pork chops n apple sauce this is the place to go!  The dessert selection will knock your socks off-  try their beignets!

Ahhh, this has been a long time coming. I've driven by Bottega Louie so many times, and I finally got to step inside. And it was NOT just so I could use the bathroom. I was immediately smitten with the crisp white interiors, tall ceilings, beautiful moldings, and the visual treat that is Bottega's bakery. THE FOOD Tagliatelle Bolognese ($14): The best bolognese I've ever had. I was resistant to order pasta here, because I wanted something different. How silly was I! The tagliatelle was cooked to perfection; it had just the right tenderness. Not too chewy, not too tough. The bolognese sauce was light on the tomato and heavy on the meat. This dish was worth every penny. Hamburger ($15): Not a big fan of the dish. It was a good burger, but I feel as though I've had better. My friend really liked it, though! Pepperoni Pizza ($18): The only thing I can say about this pizza is that it's enough for a table to share. We thought it would be a personal pizza, but it's not. Sadly, I didn't get to try. Moulin Rouge ($12): This cocktail is so tasty, it makes me giggle like a schoolgirl. The combination of Tru Lemon Vodka, St. Germain, lemon, simple syrup, and raspberry bits made for an adult raspberry lemonade. Everything about this drink is girly and fun. Love it! THE ATMOSPHERE I can't get over how beautiful the building is. There is an open kitchen as well as an open pizza kitchen. The white marble floors, the clean lines, and the tall ceilings...UGH! I DIE. Also, the bakery displays made me want to cry. THE SERVICE One word: impeccable. We did not have to wait for a seat. Our server, Tony, was incredibly accommodating and friendly. We never had to ask for refills and every dish came out promptly. He took care of us really well, and I love him for it! He was easy on the eyes, too. Holla! THE FINAL GRADE A+ // Including tip, the bill came out to be $25 per person. This won't be a cheap dinner, but it's worth visiting with a loved one or with friends. I hear their brunch is amazing. If you take anything away from my review, let it be this: Bottega is a treat for the mouth and the eyes; you should go!

So we checked this place out on a Sunday evening at about 7:30.  We arrived asand I was immediately impressed with the decor of the place.  For some reason it reminded me of a medium to upscale restaurant in NYC.  The place was packed and we were fourth in line to place our name on the list.  After putting in our name we did what every other human being waiting around for a dinner seat.....B-Line it to the BAR..... So after a round of drinks we were called up for our table after a 20 minute wait.  We were seated and immediately greeted by our waiter.  He gave us his suggestion as far as pizza was concerned at which time we opted for the portablello fries and meat balls to start off the meal.   The portabello fries and meatballs came out pretty quickly.  The portabello was suprisingly good and fresh. but in my opinion was light on the salt.  But then again I do have high blood pressure and pour salt in a lot of things in my life so don't take my word for it.  The meatballs were okay I guess.  Nothing special notated.  I believe that appetizer came with five meatballs.   We ordered the sausage pizza which was excellent and the clam pasta in olive oil sauce (I forgot the name...sorry) which was ehhh okay I guess.  For dessert we ordered the chocolate souffle which was good, but took awhile to get to us.  If you guys opt to order the souffle, be sure to order it five minutes before the anticipated time of completion of your main course.  (Rookie mistake) Now for the imfamous macarons......These Oompa Loompa colored pieces of deliciousness were amazing even for $2.00 a pop.  It is definately a must have if you pay this place a visit.   Outside of the food, the service was EXCELLENT.  I appreciate good service and if there is one thing that this place has, it is definately great service.  All in all a great experience and will be back again.

Open til midnight on weekends and is packed until midnight.  It's large, loud, and packed with LA's beautiful people.  I was impressed with the number of employees both in the kitchen (which is open and in the front) and in the dining and bakery area.  It's a stunning looking restaurant with it's cathedral high ceilings. We came in at 10:30 pm on a Friday night and had to wait 30 minutes for a table. The hostess desk has an impressive and intimidating book of reservations so we felt lucky with the 30 minute wait.   Service is friendly, but a tad slow considering the number of servers that they have.  Since we were trying to save room for their desserts we chose to eat small plates. However, 4 small plates for 2 people was simply too much food.  We got the brussel sprouts with pistachios (YUM), the broccolini (okay), the french fries (nice and crisp) and the bruschetta (something was off with the tomatoes).  For me, the highlight was the bread that they bring out to the table. Hot and fresh from the oven. It was crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.   I was somewhat disappointed on my choices as the food at the tables around us looked delicious, but again we were trying to save room for dessert.   First off the pastries look divine! So many choices it's overwhelming.  About a dozen flavors of macaroons.  However, I was steered to the raspberry filled beignets, which were disappointing especially after looking at a case filled with spectacular looking desserts. They came off as a basic jelly filled doughnut.  In my mind, nothing compares to Cafe du Monde beignets in the French Quarter.  I took home a mini blackberry tart which had 3 of the best blackberries I've ever had.  I don't remember what the other tart was that I brought home, but it had a blueberry and crumble topping. I unfortunately gave this to my son, who allowed me a small bite which was heavenly. Perfect balance of sweet, crumble and berry.   I hear that their breakfast is killer so am looking forward to a return visit.

This place is over the top.  As soon as you walk in you're smacked with all the desserts - talk about eye candy. The food was good, not over the top great - bread, onion soup, pizza, and chocolate souffle. However, the macarons were great and the rest of the desserts I'm sure are worth devouring.

The room acoustics are terrible. You practically have to yell at your friends to be heard across the table. Service was friendly but managed to mess up the bill. Food was decent but overpriced.

MMM PORTOBELLO FRIES. You might want to put on something more than just jeans and a T-Shirt if you're planning on coming here.. and get ready for some especially fine dining. To put it simply, Bottega Louie is as good as it gets. Every dish they bring out is quality after quality after quality. If you're coming here on an empty stomach, expect to be spending quite a bit because the serving sizes are rather small. Be sure to make use of all the sauces they give you, because that's where you'll feel the worth. Trust me, you will NOT be disappointed.

I prefer restaurants taking reservations, we were seated in 5 minutes when we finally decided to walk in here on a Saturday, a pleasant surprise considering the place was packed and the line was out of the door; the brunch menu is very simple, everything from drinks, pastries, foods to desserts were freshly prepared, the prices are very reasonable, service is good. I enjoyed the energy and ambiance of this place, would probably return to try their regular menu.

Was here recently and couldn't find a table in the cafe area because they were holding job interviews.  But glad they're doing this because the service was non-existant.  BL is one of these places I used to enjoy but like many Los Angeles establishments the quality of both food and service has declined.  I don't think I'm the only one who feels this way as the place is not packed like it used to be (unless you count all those people with the job applications) I went with friends for dinner a week ago and bragged about the pizza, was glad we didn't have to wait for a table but then the food came.   Well the pizza was not as good at all as I remembered - not cooked enough for the type of pizza they do, the center was soggy which I hate.  I couldn't believe it.    Portabello fries and salad were ok but fries came out not hot which didn't help and they were kinda soggy as well.   I guess there was a sogginess theme that night.  Oh and don't order the french onion soup, I got that with my lunch once - what a joke, take it off the menu.   But as I said I tried again for just a  coffee and a pastry a few days ago , pastry was good coffee was warm? but  really would rather not be surrounded by job applicants - was very weird and uncomfortable.  Don't they have an office or something to hold interviews in?  Not sure what happened with this place but it's disappointing. UPDATE When back for one last time:  Plus was there was no wait.  That was the only plus.  Bartender was rude and made a terrible drink.  Food was lousy - pizza, salad and 4 small plates.  like really lousy.  So another LA restaurant off the list.

THeir macarons is the best in LA! they also have pretty good variety. The place is really loud! you need to yell to talk with your friends. The food is just o-kay. It came out warm or even cold. only the portobello fries that is worth it. I will be back for their macarons and portobello fries only :P

I could have died and gone to heaven. We went for my mom's birthday brunch on a Saturday and only had to wait a short time. I like how the hostess remembers you and comes to get you instead of calling your name over a speaker. Not that you'd be able to hear it inside Louie. When it's packed it can get loud, but the energy is awesome. I had the eggs benedict which was really good, but my bloody mary stole the show. The portobello fries are unlike anything I've ever had, not to mention the prosciutto and barrata (a type of cheese, like mascarpone) on potato pancake. Oh and don't forget the bread and pastries. I've actually never had complimentary bread that good before. Lastly, the service is exceptional. I really appreciate a good wait staff, and you can tell Louie management is super on top of it. I've already got another trip to Louie lined up, and cannot wait to try dinner!

I've been wanting to come here for the LONGEST time and finally it happened. There's a reason why this place has 4 stars out of almost 4000 reviews. It's straight up good. We had the portobello fries. Damn those were awesome. But they wouldn't be the same without that aioli to dip 'em in! She had the trenne pasta. Never had pasta crisped up with a nice crust on it. I had the short rib. You can tell that the hunk of bovine victim was cooked LOW and SLOW. It was super tender. That lardon ragu! C'mon now. *smh* This dish was Warren Buffett. And by Warren Buffett I mean RICH! I pretty much wanted to break out in dance to express how much I enjoyed my meal. Or punch someone.

Holy Balls! Walking into this place is like Disneyland of restaurants. The interior is painted a flawless shade of white and all the sweet treats, sandwiches and gourmet goods pop up at you like one of those creepy magic-eye books! Mallrats reference comes to mind: "Wow! it's a schooner!" "you dumb bastard... That's not a schooner, its a sail boat" "A schooner is a sail boat!...stupid head" "Well ya know what? There is no Easter bunny! Over there, that's just some guy in a suit!" But I digress... For someone who loves themselves a macaroon, you will find that you have stepped yourself into the mother-load of macaroon cookie heaven. They had so many different options to choose from, it's almost painful to decide upon just a few. (Ended up tasting the Vanilla, Raspberry and Rose...all decadent and delicious). The food experience was equally magical. We ordered a margherita pizza, the deep fried cheese and portobello mushroom fries. They may as well sprinkled methamphetamine coated crack on that stuff because it was seriously addicting even after just one bite. The pizza reminded me of the kind I tasted in Italy. Thin had tossed crust, lots of emphasis on the sauce, fresh leaves of basil and a few blobs of cheese here and there. Heaven I tell you. I could seriously die now...well, not really. But you know what I mean... The portobello mushroom fries were like nothing I ever tasted. Fried, but not fried to fast-food standard. Spongy, but not WTH is in my mouth spongy, and flavorful. If you are a fan of mushrooms, this is the appetizer for you! It's a tad pricey (split the pizza, it could easily feed 3) and parking here is a B!tch... but otherwise and awesome good time.

Even on a somewhat gloomy day Bottega Louie is popping. I can only claim to have had the macaroons here, and frankly I only remember with great delight how good the cassis macaroon was, as cassis is by far my favorite macaroon flavor at any bakery. Between the 3 of us that went, we probably got like 12 macaroons to share. After waiting in line a bit we rushed back to the car and devoured all of them before we even left the parking spot.

This place is very trendy and modern looking, but the food was just ok. I went with a group of 10 and we ordered a lot, from clam pizza to rigatoni, to portabello mushroom fries and some other things but nothing really stood out. The portions were tiny, and the restaurant was so loud that you have to literally yell for the person next to you to hear you. Parking was also hard to find and if u park in the nearby structures, it can be expensive. Overall i would not come back here.

Came here for the first time on a Friday morning for breakfast with the bf and his mother. the three of us ordered: +quiche lorraine (4stars) $7 big piece, fluffy inside, yummy and pipin hot~ +ham and cheese croissant $7 (4stars) how can this go wrong. the croissant was buttery, with flakey edges, mouth watering ham and cheese. perfect bfast item. +smoked salmon on bagel $8 (5 stars) yuuuuuum. this was sooo awesome. If i come back to bl for bfast i'd get this for sure! +3 assorted beignets $4 (4stars) raspberry filling, nutella filling, and plain. raspberry one was so delicious. I'd just get couple raspberry beignets next time. +macaroons 5 for $10 (5 stars) i chose the following flavors and the guy who boxed them for me said they were the best. THEY WERE AMAZING (vanilla, violet chassis, salted caramel, white chocolate with matcha green tea, earl grey tea) I've tried macaroons from other well known stores but I think bl def beats all of them so far All in all I think I should come back for dinner here at BL. I will definitely help myself to some macaroons here. TIPS: -Macaroons (vanilla, violet chassis, salted caramel, white chocolate with matcha green tea, earl grey tea) -if coming for bfast on weekday, probably best to come around 9am as street parking right outside starts at 9am

Apparently, BL macarons cost $2 each now.. but they are larger! The earl grey and rose flavored macarons are still my favorite. Rose being my absolute favorite. The texture is just right and I love the bite through the macaron - just a little chewy with a light crispy crust. Thanks for the foodie gift, Freya L! =)

Finally came here for the first time with my family. They don't take reservations here but we were able to get a table for 7 in about 15 minutes on a Friday evening. The ambiance of the restaurant is very cute, with high ceilings and white walls. The kitchen is open and you can watch them cook/make pizza. It looks like it would be a nice place to have brunch. The only thing my family didn't like was that it was very loud in there with everyone talking I guess the sound just bounces against the walls like crazy. I would give Bottega 4 stars because the food was very good, but our service was pretty crappy. The waiter said the food was Italian and pastas were "family style" for sharing, so I was expecting more Buca sized plates. I couldn't see the portion sizes on other guest's tables from where we were sitting. I'm glad that we ended up getting individual entrees because the pasta sizes were relatively small and individual sized. I don't see how you could have shared them unless it was between 2 people. Also our waiter was very rushed in getting our order. We had to remind him that we wanted to order drinks and he left before my dad could even order his beer. Our main  entrees arrived relatively fast, but way before our drinks came. My mom said she would have liked if they offered parmesan cheese with our pasta, but I guess you have to request it here. Now that the bad stuff is out of the way, on to the food reviews. I loved the clam linguini which had great clam flavor, an abundance of clams, and had a hint of spiciness. I tried some of my cousin's shrimp scampi which had giant yummy prawns on top. My mom ordered the Ceppo Gamber which was good, had shimp, broccolini, sun dried tomatoes, and olive oil, but was very simple and could easily be replicated at home. The creme brûlée here is very good. The Grand Macaron is so-so, nothing much to rave about. A trip here isn't complete with their famous macarons. I'm still finishing my box but they are all delicious! Hopefully when I come back here I'll have a better experience with the waiting staff.

:)  Yay list: Love the food. The scallops and mushroom fries is a MUST. I always end up polishing a bottle of wine here because of the crowds liveliness. Its hip, young and LOUD.  After a few drinks you end up just nodding halfway through most conversations. I wouldnt recommend this for a intimate night for two. (go when its less busy) The decor is pretty neat and the restaurant is spacious. They have a desert and coffee bar towards the entrance. Macroons are a bit expensive but I hear they are rather tasty. Service has always been great. I am def. a FAN

The food is not bad, but it's not great.  For some reason, this place reminds me of Caesar's Palace because of all the white walls, high ceilings, and wide open space.  I've been here a couple times on the weekend but both times were around 10 or 10:30pm so the late was no longer than 20 minutes. Items ordered: Penne Gamber Pasta $14-  2/5 Very small portion and oily.  The whole dish was finished in less than 4 or 5 bites =/ All pizzas are $18 Burrata Pizza -3/5 -Burrata, Grana parmesan, rapini, garlic, extra virgin olive oil & prosciutto di Parma Too salty for me but duh, prosciutto is supposed to be salty.  Wasn't my idea to order it. Napoli Pizza- 4/5 -Mozzarella, Grana parmesan, tomato sauce, oregano, red onions, white mushrooms & olives YUM!  I love mushrooms and olives! Mushroom Pizza- 4/5 -Fontina cheese, fresh mozzarella, crème fraîche, shiitake mushrooms, garlic & Italian parsley MUSHROOMS!!! Tip: If you can't decide between pizzas or simply want to try more pizzas without ordering 894283 pizzas, you have the option to have different toppings on each half of the pizza at no extra charge! Portobello Fries- $10-  2/5 OVERRATED.  Way too fried.  I wish it had a lighter coating of batter.  I ended up having to scrape some of the batter off to actually taste the mushroom. Macarons- $2 each - 3/5 Overall, not bad.  But I definitely recommend the macarons at Euro Pane Bakery or 'Lette Macarons over the ones here.  Most of the flavors are a bit too strong and overpowering. Even though this place doesn't have the best food in the world (or in LA), I'd say it's still worth visiting at least once!

Here are 14 reasons Bottega Louie shouldn't look like it's being sacked by an army clothed by Gucci: Baco Mercat Blue Cow Daikokuya Drago Centro Honda-ya Komasa Mendocino Farms Parish, The Pie Hole Shinsengumi Sushi-Gen Urbano Pizza Wood Spoon Wurstküche Items tried: Pizza (bianco, burrata, pepperoni, sausage), some crappy pasta, portobello fries. Bath salts often accompany carnage of this level. If you are able to brave the interminable wait for a table, you will be rewarded with pizzas that taste like charcoal and fries that are oily and probably used to grease the treadmills used on the Biggest Loser. Modern artist Banksy appropriately captures what an experience in this bottega is like with his piece where a dog is peeing into a picture frame. Here is the problem with Bottega - there are literally 10-20 better places that are within a 5-10 min drive from this abomination. You can leave you Stockholm, people. The time lost waiting in line, with time being as precious as it is, as well as the opportunities of going to a far better place simply make this restaurant a unwise venture. You have a better shot of surviving the Hunger Games, then surviving Battle Royal, and finally The Great Food Truck Race than getting to sit down at a table at Bottega Louie with a reasonable wait. Want pizza? Go to Mozza. Want fries? Go to Wurstküche. Want to be talked down to by a waiter? Go to K-town where you won't understand it as it's happening. At least there it's all you can eat and they endlessly loop Gangnam style. Had a lobotomy? Go to Bottega Louie.

I have driven & walked by and always thought this place was really upscale and felt intimidated to ever go in. A couple of friends and I decided to go have brunch here on a Sunday morning and we were surprised. The service was really great, there are really nice waiters who are kind, energetic, good looking, and easy to strike up conversation with. The downside is the people who come here. Like I said, I felt it was really upscale and pompous, but it's not the people who work there that make it feel that way, but the people that go. My friends and I got looks from this woman just because we weren't dressed in fancy clothes. Honestly, ignore those people, don't let that stop you from enjoying a nice meal here! Even if a little on the pricey side, the quality of the food is amazing, and the service is welcoming, regardless of who you are!

What a Mecca of desserts! A plethora of sweet treats! Stylish interior and even more stylish eats. I've been here a few times and each time has been a different experience. My favorite visit was when I came here for brunch with my sister and my wife. We were staying at the Standard hotel and walked over on a beautiful Saturday morning. We were seated rather quickly considering how bustling it was. Our meals were fresh and delightful. I'd love to come do breakfast there again. Going there in the evening is a totally different experience! It's like a hip club... Trendy folks in fancy gear sipping cocktails, loud music, crowded spaces, pure hubbub. All in all, this place has it all. Something for everyone!

My baby sister has been dying to try Bottega Louie, so we went for her 18th birthday. My three sisters went crazy over the macarons and had a lovely meal. Jimmy N. and I had mixed thoughts on Bottega Louie. Between the service and the food, it was a hit or miss. I would dine here again, but I'm not rushing back. There's usually a long wait, but the restaurant was pretty empty on Thursday at 5pm. I would not wait for this restaurant. Parking: Meters or parking structure. They do not validate. $4-5 to park usually. Ambiance: Love the high ceilings and decor! Definitely a hip place to take a date or hang out with girlfriends. Service: The asian hostess with short hair had the biggest attitude. I'm not a hater, but the chick acted like she was running Operation Neptune Spear (Navy Seals OPs name for Osama bin Laden). I gave her my name/party size and waited for her to say something. After moving stuff around her hostess stand, she rudely asked us to step aside while we wait for a table, so that other patrons may approach the stand. Uh, the dinning room was completely empty at 5:00pm. It took her 5 minutes to seat us. I don't mind waiting, but she didn't have to be rude about it. Thankfully, our server and busser were very friendly and took great care of our table. Macarons: People rave about their macarons, but I think they're just okay. The Parisian cookies were too dense and dry, not like the perfect ones I've had elsewhere. They're still good, but not a traditional macaron. We ordered 18 macarons and I liked every flavor! A+ on flavor, C+ on cookie shells. Bill for the pretty macarons came out to $40...ouch. Food: Portobello Fries - Delicious! A must order :) I had to trick my vegetable hating sister to try them and she LOVED it. Bianco Pizza - Crying for salt. It was too bland for my taste. GREAT crust though :) Penne Gamber - My favorite item of the night. I enjoyed the light white wine sauce, pasta was cooked al dente, and they gave a large portion of shrimp. Light and yummy! Lasagna - My sister said "best lasagna ever." But, she only has Costco lasagna to compare it with. Short Ribs - This would have been great if the chef didn't finish the dish with a ton of salt. I couldn't taste anything but salt for a while. The dish itself needed something to balance out the saltiness of the dish. The short rib was salty, the ragu sauce was salty, and even the polenta was salty. Blah. So. Much. Potential. Roasted Chicken - I didn't get to try this dish, but my sister said it was better than Wood Ranch's roasted chicken. It had the most incredible looking crispy skin. Price: It's steep for what you're getting, but not that bad. Our dinner for five came out to $130 total without alcohol.

This review is long over due but I find it necessary to write a review on one of my faves. Better late than never right? I've been coming here the last couple of years or so and I've never had a bad experience. I love this place like no other. It's not pretentious despite having the hip/ trendy vibe. I 've been to Bottega dressed up and I've hit this place up wearing jeans, chucks and a hoodie. Straight skid row bum look. That's how chill this place is.  I love coming here because the staff is friendly, you get unlimited free sparkling water and the food is bomb. Must gets and must trys: Mushroom Portobello fries are a must have. I don't care if you stuff your face with 100s of macarons you must get this when you come here. Battered, fried, fungal goodness.  This ish is nasty good. Napoli Pizza is ginormous. Great for sharing and tasty! Trenne Pasta with rib eye is delicious. Macaroons: Orange dark espresso flavor and Coffee. ( I dream of the next time these things touch my lips) Brunch is awesome too. Nothing is more G than eating poached eggs with lobster and capping it off by sipping hot chocolate and snacking on raspberry beignets for dessert.

Love this place!! Been here a few times, took me a while to write a review. Just made a visit again a few weeks ago. I came here for brunch a year ago which i love. But i dont remember what i had because it was over a year ago. I think it was english muffin with egg, bacon and something... This time, I ate their chicken salad... forgot the actual name WOW im really sucking at writing this review right now. I just remembered it had a really light dressing, chicken, slices of avocado, and green onions - tasted very fresh and healthy which I enjoyed. My friend ordered their mushroom pizza - ehhh.. it was ok. But i also ordered their fried portebello mushrooms which i can eat a million of them!!! Also had a drink called Clover Leaf - had a nice kick to the gin. Loud EXTREMELY loud enviorment, but i love the high ceilings, the white-colored walls and decor of the dessert section. Fave macaroons is the chocolate, and green one. Also bought creme brulee - it was okay... didnt really taste that fresh. Their raspberry chocholate creme brule with a macaroon bottom was probably extremely high in calories, but worth every bite!!!! I'll always come back here, just have to make time. haha

Ambiance is nice but the wait is 2 hours for a table. NO reservations.  So we sat at the bar area to eat which is fine.   Ordered:   Pizza: OK not the best I've eating but ok for $20 Pasta dish:  good you can tell the pasta is freshly made. A+ Portabello Fries: delishhhhhhh!!! worth it for 10$ desserts:  delish!!! creme brulee and strawberry shortcakes A+++ Macarons:  It was good but i had better! Now heres the reason why I only gave it two stars:  1 star for the food, and 1 star for good customer service. So we get the bill it was about $71, we paid part cash and the rest in my credit card which was about $41. Anyway so I signed it with tip and everything BUT a week later I check my bank and its not quite how I balanced it. Then, I realized that they had charged my credit card for the whole bill of 71$ not the $41 which i have signed. So before calling my bank to report unauthorized amount I called them. The lady was nice enough to refund me and get back to me right away but the refund takes 5-7 business days AND what they should've done was offered me a free meal or some kind of compesations for the hassle they brought me in my bank.   This is why they only get two stars. If they didn't charge me $71 they wouldve probably gotten 4 stars.  Sorry because of what happened. Don't think I would come back.

+1 star for having tasty, if not extraordinary, Italian food at mid-range prices (as of now, pastas are $14 - 16 and a pizza to share $20) +1 star because it was not too hard to find street parking in the vicinity -1 star for the noise level -- the sound reverberates off the walls and it can be hard to hear the person across from you -1 star because drinks are too pricey for my taste (an okay selection of beers $7 - 8, interesting cocktails $12), with no happy hour to make the drinks affordable for this cheapskate So the pluses and minuses roughly balance each other out . . . . but PLUS 3 STARS because I SAW DIANNE KEATON HERE!  If Annie Hall eats here, there must be something to it, right?

I love Bottega Louie even though it's always jam pack here. The portabella mushroom fries are " TO DIE FOR," you have to try it!!! Our waitress recommended us to try the lamb and it did not disappoint us! The banana bread pudding was delicious as well. We were really happy and our tummy was satisfied. It's a little expensive, but it's worth it!!! The service is good for being packed 24/7! The only thing that sucks us that they don't take reservations and it's 1st come 1st serve. Don't cone here starving because you will have to wait for a table unless you're lucky enough to find it at the bar.

Being seated for dinner was a quick process. Bread - Really hard to chew! Good thing it's free! Portobello Fries - A MUST TRY! Mushrooms deep fried possibly in truffle oil? (it sure tastes like it) and it comes with a sauce that tastes like garlic aioli. Perfect combination and the perfect appetizer! $10 Fettucine Belmondo - The fettucine tasted as if it was freshly made! Everything combined was the perfect combination. $14 Chocolate Souffle - When I took the first bite, I really wanted an ice cold cup of milk to go with it.. but once I took a bite of it with the cream it comes with.. it was perfect. It tasted like a light, soft oreo concoction. $15

It's really loud and packed at times but if you like that kind of environment this is the place for you! I have taken at least 6 people here and suggest they come if they're looking for a feel good dinner. The food is great! They have a few dishes of everything you might be craving! Always cooked to perfection! The desserts are so delicious, it's my favorite part of the meal. The chocolate soufflé is to die for and if you like I've cream I suggest you get it alamode! The drinks are also great, berry lemonade is my fav And last but not least! The people who go there are really chill and you might even start up a convo with the people at the next table.

A stunning dining room that is best attended on the off nights, a slow Monday, or a rousing Wednesday (maybe a sultry Thursday, but you're pushing it). The burrata pizza approached Mozza in quality. The grilled octopus shows the adroitness, and acumen of the chefs behind the industrialized culinary process. Their Torpedo shows them to be the Bay Cities of Downtown. But the trenne pasta that is grilled just enough so that the pasta comes to resemble the most beautiful, hollowed out french fries in this galactic cluster, with hopelessly tender pieces of braised ribeye, and black kale in a salty, savory broth...that's something else, that's divine inspiration, the kind of dish that changes the game, and makes you rethink your entire career as an eater of foods, at least of a class of foods, namely pasta. There should be no question that BL stands with the best restaurants in LA. It is a glistening jewel in the midst of the urban decay of downtown (literally, it sparkles). I've heard rumors of magnanimous chicken parmesan as well. I really need to find an excuse to go back sometime soon!

Had lunch here today with my daughter.  We both got the Mâché salad, which had chicken, avocado, watercress, and snap peas. It was tossed lightly with olive oil and came with a Meyer lemon for zesting. We both loved it. We also tried the portabella  fries; they were lightly breaded and served with a yummy dipping sauce.  I found this sauce to be the best aspect of this dish. Our server was very friendly and attentive. The environment had some old world charm in a cafeteria like setting. For the $75 including tax and tip and two glasses of house white wine, I thought it was a bit pricey. Before leaving I bought 8 of their supposedly famous macaroons - the price tag on those...$17.95!  I didn't notice the price tag until it was rung up. I would rather eat a trader Joe's macaroons in a heart beat. We threw most of them out as we weren't wild for them.

Three minus. I've only come here for their desserts. I tried their macarons a couple of years ago but didn't like them... they were too sweet, frankly.  However, now that I've had plenty worse, I am re-evaluating.  This was re-affirmed when I recently had a salted caramel one while waiting for a friend to go to dinner at another place.  The center really did taste like salted caramel, mmm. I also tried the "beignets," but they tasted like doughnuts... stuffed with jelly filling and all.  I've had more authentic ones in San Marino.

Food: 4 Service: 4 Ambience: 4 :) Portobello fries Arugula pizza Reservation: do not take reservation Parking: valet or self park Random Note: * Got there around 5:30 so was seated immediately. But a long line started to form after we sat down. Too bad it doesn't take reservation. * Loud n lively environment * Portobello fries is a must! Couldn't stop eating it. All time favorite! * Just be careful about what you order. Stay away from pasta. Pizza n desserts are decent.

This review is for the bakery/macarons. I ate at the restaurant with my family in addition to perusing the bakery but I can't remember what I ate... (I know it was good though!) Anyway, the macarons here are awesome. No, amazing. This is the first place I've ever eaten a macaron so I may be biased. They have a rainbow display of macarons as you walk in the door, it is delightful. The bakery (and restaurant) itself is very classy looking. It's in downtown LA, so you'll have to find street parking or a nearby paid parking lot, but honestly, those coffee macarons are so good I'd be willing to deal with that...

No restaurant is perfect, but this place is about as close as it gets. The reason why it gets five stars is that the good far outweighs the bad. It is loud, it can take a while to be sat, but once you are, you are in for a real treat. Their entrees are amazing, but what really sets this place apart is the fantastic pizza. Seriously, a sausage and/or pepperoni pizza from this place is to die for. The best pizza in LA I've had so far. Simply incredible. For dessert, you have to order the chocolate souffle. Well worth the wait and money. This place is an experience. It has something to it ... an energy if you will that is simply not matched anywhere else.

I swore to myself that I would not fall in love with this place but I did! Maybe its the beautiful high ceiling or the simple white walls. But Bottega Louie is a gorgeous space! Besides that, there's not much going for it besides the pastries and macarons. I've been here for brunch on multiple occasions and it is always packed. The wait can range from 15 mins or maybe an hour and sometimes it isn't worth it. The items on their brunch menu are overpriced and the portions are small. I would rather go to other brunch joints in LA. However their macarons are simply delicious and at $2.00 a piece they are a little pricier then 'Lette. They do offer some flavors that can't be found at 'Lette! For instance, the Grand Cru and the Orange Chocolate macarons, which are both my favorite. Street parking can be difficult to find at this location but if you head a little further down on Grand towards 8th or 9th you may be able to find street parking. There are also parking lots available on Grand. So -1 for the parking and another for the pricing. But, its definitely a place to come and marvel at the desserts and admire the space. People watching here isn't too bad either.

Was so excited to come here for the first time.  Unfortunately it will be my last time visiting this place.  First off, we were a party of 8, but one of my friends was running a little late so we asked if we could be placed on the waitlist and order for him if we were seated before he arrived.  Their stupid policy wouldn't let them do that so we we had to wait for him and then wait an extra 30 minutes on top of that.  That was forgivable because its their policy, even if it was a idiotic one. After being seated we ordered our food.  Six of the dishes came out at the same time, but the other two (pizzas) came out well after.  As I sat there watching my food get cold, I thought to myself, they better not be charging me the large group gratuity for this crappy service.  The pizzas finally came, one of them half burnt (maybe they wouldn't have burnt it if they had brought out all the dishes on time).  We were too hungry to complain and didn't want our food getting any colder so we just started eating.   The food was not as amazing as these reviews would have you think.  Portabello mushroom fries were overcooked and the batter was too flaky (in my honest opinion. Some people might be into that (not me), but if you've had portabello mushroom fries before, you'll see what i mean).  For my entree I had to pork chop, which was good, but not good enough to make up for the service, or lack thereof.  Everything else was very standard. After we got the check, sure enough, there was the standard 20% large group gratuity.  I know this was their policy as well, but I had had enough of the poor service. If they were going to treat me this way, I should get a say in how much tip I would provide.  At least the manager was nice enough to hear me out and grant me my demand.  I did not however like his insinuation that they were not at fault for the food being late or that I should have complained about my pizza being burnt.   Needless to say, this was a poor experience and I will not be coming back.  The only reason this place gets a 2 and not a 1 is because the the manager was willing to hear me out and a nice worker at the front bakery area gave me a cookie to salvage an otherwise miserable night.

Wowzy!  This is a must see/do if you are ever in downtown LA!  And it is open like nearly every waking hour, so you could have your three squares here along with snacks and drinks!  We came on Saturday at about 4 pm for early bird dinner, and it was quite busy.  We didn't have to wait for a table, but there was a line soon after we were seated.  Loved the beautiful ceilings and the bathrooms.  Yes, the bathrooms!  The place is so noisy, and the bathrooms are not only gorgeous, but they are also wonderfully peaceful and quiet.   Now onto the food!  After reviewing my fellow yelpers suggestions, I ordered the portebello fries and the trenne.  My meester ordered the angus steak.  The portebello fries were ok, but not my cup of tea.  As for The trenne, it wasn't hot enough (heat wise), and somewhat bland.  However, I liked the kale and beef, and the way the juice soaked the pasta.  Meester enjoyed his steak--even the veggies!  Next time, I think I will go with the pizza.  We were sitting near the ovens, and all those pizzas kept calling out to me.  I should have just ordered one, but I thought that was too safe a choice. The real star at this place is dessert -- most definitely the reason we will be back.  I have never had a macaron before, so I took Claudia B.'s advice and ordered the grand macaron, and was so pleased with my pretty dessert, complete with a rose petal, fresh berries, and the most wonderful vanilla ice cream.  Meester had strawberry shortcake and a side of vanilla gelato.  Yums!  As we headed for the door, bellies bulging, we heard more crying out.  It was coming from the bakery -- where more desserts were begging us to take them home.  So with great empathy, we adopted three desserts and quickly got the heck out of there lest we lose all control.   P.S.  Service is also quite good.

Date: 06/09 @ 6PM Pros: Nice for people watching, great service, parking is easy (for LA). Cons: Waited 45 mins, but that's to be expected I guess. Wife and I got here and checked in with the hostess. She told us 45 minutes and she was right on the dot. Waiting wasn't too bad since there's the bakery and lots of people to people-watch. Staff seemed and was very professional, I thought. We had a Burrata and Bianco pizza (half half), Portobello Fries and the Trenne. The Trenne was okay, but wasn't anything special. I was surprised at the pizza topping combinations, but they were both good--we liked the Bianco the best. The Portobello Fries were great of course. Overall, food was good, but I was expecting more from a 4K+ review restaurant. I guess its just a trendy place, but my wife and I are more interested in interesting food. Out of the three, the star item for us was Portobello Fries.

Great entrance to this restaurant!  When you arrive you are greeted by the amazing pastry case...makes you want to start with dessert instead of dinner.  The atmosphere is elegant, simple and just plain nice.  The service is excellent - just the right amount of checking on you without being annoying.  The food was great too - I enjoyed the tagliatelle bolognese and it was flavorful, meaty and just the right size portion.

Location is horrible but its totally worth going through the hustle and bustle of downtown LA.  The rainbow maccaroon display in the front of the restaurant doesn't only look good it tastes amazin! It's one of the best maccaroons I've had, flaky and chewy! As for the in dining area its has a very welcoming and social like atmosphere. The staff were very nice to us. Kobe Beef Burger is delicious, very juicy. The portabello fries are definitely a must order every time i come here. The pizzas are alright probably wouldn't get it again. The calamari is also something id probably order again.

I still remembered buying my very first macarons (classic chocolate, vanilla, and raspberry) at a French-Vietnamese pâttiserie in Orange County, CA about a year ago. I didn't fall in love with this French cookie back then because they were even sweeter than cupcakes. However, I have savored Parisian macarons lately and desperately want to try out as many places that offer these perfect shaped cookies with vibrant colors. We came to Bottega Louie on a Thursday night just to get the macarons that everybody has been talking about. In my mind, it was as solid as rock that there wouldn't be any luck for street parking, so my boyfriend drove around while I hopped inside to get the cookies. At the intersection of 7th and Grand, our minds were blown away by the gigantic concrete structure for a corner restaurant. Wow! As I stepped inside, an array of many different colors of macarons struck me right away. Another Wow! There were so many people buying desserts at the gourmet market side and patrons dining at the table side. It was chaos, but I finally managed to get the girl behind the counter some attention. Told her what I needed and she helped me to pick and put the macarons in a beautifully designed box. I was super delighted! I came home, opened the box, and tried the most classic flavor - vanilla. It wasn't a WOW since I and my bf didn't like the shell texture. I like the fact that they have so many flavors as indicated by various colors of the shell. Just by looking at them makes me happy. However, despite their different colors of the meringue and supposedly different flavors, they all taste the same except a few that persist a strong fragnance on their shells. There is not many variations in the sandwiched filling either, most of them have dark chocolate ganache, fruit jam, and depends on the kinds of macaron flavors, you get different buttercream. I highly recommend the macarons with buttercream filling. Not bad macarons, but they are not my favorites! $26 for a box of 13.

One of the premier Italian restaurants in Los Angeles. Went for lunch, and pricing was very reasonable for this type of restaurant.  The chicken parmesan was one of the best I have ever had.  I asked the waiter what to order between the pizza and chicken parm, and when he said it was the same size as the pizza I couldn't resist, and had to order the chicken parm, and couldn't be happier. Also tried the pizza bianca and meatball sliders. Great service and great food. Will definitely go back soon.

Love the setting and the energy. Had a lunch meeting here, and we were seated within a really reasonable time during the rush. The front area is a casual cafe where you can buy pastries and such from the gorgeous baked goods section in the front and have a more casual stop. Inside the open dining room, you'll see a lot of pizzas. I'm a huge fan of pizza and they do a nice version here. They will also let you do half and half, so I shared a half meatball/half sausage. The pizzas have a slightly crunchier crust, but I wouldn't consider it really thin-crust. I don't love it the way I love Neapolitan pies (the kinds with a chewy crust and char marks), but it's still good. Took some pastries home, and they were all decent but not mind-blowing. Their macarons are really pretty but the flavors were not the best I've ever seen. They were more sweet than bright and true to label. The cupcakes were also super adorable but the taste was just ok. Kind of an 'I've had better' experience but good enough. Would definitely return. Parking is a pain - you have to use a paid lot next door or good luck finding a meter. Not sure if there's validation, but the attendant told me no.

We sort of stumbled upon the place (thru Yelp) after googling for places for lunch after our visit to the Disney concert hall. I was very pleased with the find and can't wait to return.  We were lucky that we did not have to wait for a table and was almost seated immediately. The desserts display was to die for and was the first thing you see when you walk in! The ceiling in the dining area was high and gave this place a very elegant look. The open kitchen and the loudness  from diners gave this place a very casual feel . Since this place was a little loud, noisy kids or crying babies might fit well in here. No one will give you the dirty stare! =) Service was great and very prompt. Anyway, as we were there just before brunch was over we had the brunch menu and i ordered the eggs benedict while my FIL ordered the salmon benedict. These were to die for. The eggs were perfectly poached and the hollandaise sauce was one of the best I've had. The husband had the hamburger which he thought was pretty good too. My MIL ordered the club sandwich and it was one of the most beautifully crafted sandwich we've seen....though stacked a little too high, she had to tear it up to eat it. =( . How could I not mention that delicious portobello fries? the Portobello steaks were fried to perfection; not oily and crisp and was perfect with the aoili! I wished we ordered a little more! We had a fulfilling lunch and I couldn't go home without taking some desserts with me. I bought a scrumptious lucious vanilla eclair and a small box of macaroons. The desserts were nicely boxed. The macaroons were pretty good in general; not the best I've had but they are still good in my books. Will definitely be back to drool at their dessert display!!!!!

We argued for a while, and argued some more...and then finally decided to go to this place. Why were we arguing? Well BL doesn't do reservations, and I don't do places that don't do reservations! I hate waiting around. I literally have no patience what so ever. We called them and they said the wait would be an hour so I said HELL NO. But then we sat in our hotel room trying to figure out where to go instead, and wasted about an hour, so we decided to head to BL, and they had a table for us! The decor here is awesome. It's a high energy place but it looks sweet. Huge windows and it's all white. We sat down and ordered some foody food. We'd heard about those portabello fries so we got those, they were alright. I wasn't in love with them, mostly because I thought that they were going to be something else, and not actually friend mushrooms. Boy I was way off! Some people liked it though. I got the bolognese, which was good, not amazing, but good. Honestly I thought it needed more sauce, but it was good. I had some bites of other people's stuff and theirs were really good. I guess you just need to know what to order. I would say this place, from the stuff I had, would be 3 stars, but the decor/atmosphere bumps it up, and also the service: our waiter was ON POINT. Can't remember eating at a restaurant where I actually felt like bigging up the waiter, but big ups to that guy! He even managed to sort out our paying methods, which was basically a whole bunch of cards and a little bit of cash. I didn't get any drinks but the cocktails I was told were very good. Maybe when I go back to LA I will try them out, and some different foods....

I didn't eat at the restaurant, I just got some bakery items to go, so this review is just covering that aspect of this business. The store is beautiful looking! Everything seems very organized, pretty and clean. The items behind the bakery glass are gorgeous and make it so hard to choose. Once I picked out my items, I went to the cashier to purchase them. He was very nice and friendly, he got my items and packed them with care. Everything was so yummy and worth every penny. I will be stopping in here every time I am in Los Angeles now.

Excellent food. My wife had the trenne which was the best thing we had and was unlike anything I've ever had. The pizza was good too but not spectacular. Had the souffle for dessert and was a little disappointed. Forgot to mention the portobello fries and loved them.

One word - MACARONS! This place has the best I have ever had.  They are light and not too sweet.  Highly recommend the following ones: salted caramel earl grey lemon Oh yeah, their food and cocktails are great, too!  While on a business trip, came here for dinner.  The place was packed on a Tuesday night.  We waited over an hour for our table, but no worries as we filled up with their creative cocktails while waiting. Try the Japanese Sour or Moulin Rouge.  You will not be disappointed! For dinner, I recommend the Lyonnaise salad, diver scallops and burrata pizza

I came here for lunch with a few friends last week. I was excited to go but definitely got my bubble burst. Bottom line: bloated prices to go along with the bloated egos of the staff. Details: Ambience: The place is beautiful. Gorgeous decor & architecture. Service: All the workers could've checked their little snooty attitudes at home. The host practically had a seizure when I requested a booth. Mind you it was completely DEAD and I can see at least 5-7 booths empty. I love that he responded, "I'll have to see if there are any available." Really dude?! Our waiter was even better - by that I mean he had an even bigger stick up his snooty ass. I almost felt like he wanted us to cater to him at one point. The service here is laughable. Negative points if I could give it. Food: portobello fries: delish, def recommend! burger: Cooked to medium rare like I requested but I've definitely had better elsewhere. I asked for sharp cheddar but our amazing waiter forgot it. Yep, there goes that awesome service. pizza: we got the.. mushroom - good artichoke - good chocolate souffle: decadent. Note: I did request for strawberries on the side that NEVER came and of course he waited until we were almost done to say they were on there way. Did I mention he rolled his eyes when I asked for them? So no, of course we didnt get them w our souffle. As far as the pastries go, I do love their green tea macarons & the chocolate eclair. The cupcake was bland. The beignet was nothing special. It seems as if most of these pastries are the type to be pretty but are mediocre on taste and I hate that. Overall, I find this place mediocre at best, but the subpar service is what ultimately drives this rating. Would I come back? Hmmm maybe just to order those green tea macs to go..but then again there's always Paulette's or Cafe Dulce down the street and their employees are always smiling and happy to serve you.

Definitely wanted to see what the hype was about. Food is made fresh, beautifully, and it's a great place to gather on the weekend for brunch or lunch. The service was impeccable that Sunday we went. The girl was sweet, SUPER attentive, always filling the glass or asking if we needed anything. To be honest, I haven't had that kind of service in a restaurant for a while. The open space is unlike any restaurant in the area, it felt airy and festive. The egg benedict was made beautifully. Bloody mary in the am? Sure why not.

since bottega louie is wildly popular...and have more yelp reviews than any other business, i did not visit until now. driven by plenty of times. i told hubby that hipsters hang out here. he was like, "no, they don't." well, the person directly in front of us was wearing a shirt that said, "SAVE A HIPSTER" on his back. LOL!!! *guess he is still in denial that i'm always right.* bottege louie is HUGE!!! the sell desserts on one end, have a cafe/eating area, and the restaurant part. we walked in and let them know that we wanted a table. in less than five minutes, we were shown to our table. *saturday late brunch* still water or sparkling water is complimentary. (they add their own carbonation to their still water) complimentary bread that is very crunchy on the outside with soft butter. bread is placed on the table (since they change the paper surface for each new group. the bread is easy to pull apart. breakfast flatbread - prosciutto, arugula, cheese flatbread topped with an overeasy egg. tasted just like the boreka from the moishe's farmer market at the grove (3rd/fairfax). mache salad - mixed greens with chopped sugar snap peas, celery, watercress...plus a squeeze of lemon with a light vinaigrette. refreshing salad potato pancakes - two round potato pancakes about 3.5 inches in diameter and 3/4 inch thick. came with applesauce and white cream. they have a dessert menu that is for the restaurant or you can ask them to bring you desserts from the other side (but you have to walk over to choose them first). we opted to pick up dessert later. people watching is interesting... =) now i can say that i've been to bottega louie!!! =)

I almost wanted to give this place 2 stars to balance out all the people that gave it 5 stars.   Seriously?  5 stars? Anyways, on to the review. The restaurant consists of basically one large minimally but tastefully appointed "hall."   It has very high ceilings and marble EVERYWHERE.   The vibe here is kind of a "loud family get together sans the annoying in laws." It's so loud i actually thought i was at a Chinese restaurant eating Dim Sum on Sunday. We came here for brunch and ordered the following items Lobster Hash - probably the best dish Pepperoni Pizza - thin crust wood fire type pizza, very good French Toast - could have gotten this at IHOP Belgium Waffles - could have gotten this at IHOP So far this place 50/50.... The server was "polite" but you can't help but feel rushed when you eat here.  There are a lot of people waiting and they want to get you out of there ASAP so they can seat the next party.   The one thing that bugged the crap out of me was the waiter asking us if we wanted dessert when we were clearly nowhere near being done with our food!  Personally if i was paying like 30 dollars a pop for breakfast i want to be able to sit and enjoy my food instead of having someone constantly looming over us waiting for us to leave... My wife bought some of the Macaroons and they were good but not being much of a sweets person I can't comprehend paying 2 dollars for 1 macaroon.  If I wanted good cakes i'd just go to Portos Ultimately I thought this place was ok but i personally don't like their formula of "casual vibe" + "high end restaurant prices"

Interiors: - High ceilings, white bare walls & flooring = extremely loud ambience.  Open wood-oven. Service: - This is hit or miss depending on how overwhelmed they are that night.

First thing's first: Driving around downtown sucks soooo much. All these one way roads and it didn't help that they closed some streets down for a movie filming. Ugh. Totally went around in circles for the longest time. But the food at Bottega Louie is sooo good (and so is the service)! The food presentation is gorgeous and my striped sea bass dish was delectable! I also ordered Portobello Fries and omggg, it's so good!!!! Then I finished by ordering macarons. Omggg, at $2 a piece that stuff better be bombbbb! And it was, nothing TOO amazing though.

Came here for one thing only...macaroons.  At $2 a pop, these colorful treats can be a pricey addiction.  Thankfully Botegga Louie isn't local for me or I'd be killing these on a regular basis.  Of all the ones I tried, my favorite was the matcha and earl grey.  Though I will need to try more of them. As wonderfully packaged as they are in their pink boxes and bows, I'm wondering if they can't just throw em in a bag and drop the cost a bit.  Only wastes my time trying to get to them! :D

PLACE Nice, clean, and somewhat upscale feel. But dang, it was loud! I was yelling across the table to my boyfriend. SERVICE Horribly slow. I was so hungry, I was ready to eat the crumbs on the table next to us. FOOD Entrees were meh. Portobello fries were delicious and the chocolate souffle with cream. But, again, a long wait for the dessert. OVERALL I'd probably go back to try their baked goods, but not so much to sit down and eat.

This place seems to be the happening place to be in downtown LA. Place was packed on Thursday night about 9pm. The food was really good and there was some interesting signature drinks. Prices were reasonable too. I ordered clam linguini with a side of brussel sprouts and that was around 20 to 25 bucks. I also tried the portabello fries which are really mushrooms. Great starter. I'd definitely go back again.

Pizza was really good but the lasagna was overpriced and significantly overcooked; it was all one texture... uhhhh no thank you. Also the wait time and hostess service was obnoxious. HOWEVER... their pastries and macaroons are amazinggg. Waiter and wait staff was incredibly nice, polite, and helpful and the service was very fast after the 3 hour wait to get to our table.

Want to impress a girl on your first date? Hit up Bottega Louie! She'll fall in love with the all white decor, fancy atmosphere, beautiful dessert selection, and if you're lucky, you as well haha. Though I enjoyed the food, I really think the highlight of Bottega Louie is their macaroons. They have a great array set out in the very front and they box them up in cute little boxes. Sure, they're $2 a pop, but who doesn't love macaroons? I personally adore Bottega based on these little treats alone.

Came here for dessert with friends while I was in town earlier this year and instantly felt like I was on the set of Sex & the City, but surrounded by a whole lot of macaroons. The ambiance added to my experience with the upscale, elegant, and French decor. While this place serves pizza, I had the chocolate souffle. Very unique. Instead of cutting into hot steamy chocolate heaven, we waited for the the waiter to pour the very rich white chocolate sauce into the middle of the chocolate cake. While I wanted to love it and thought the concept was interesting - almost like a deconstructed souffle - I can't say that I was very impressed by it. Overly sweet sauce with semi-dry cake. But that being said, I adore the ambiance and will be back to try the pizza & macaroons!

Yesterday night my boyfriend and I celebrated our one year anniversary at Bottega Louie. Being a Yelp junkie, I've heard about this place months ago and had to finaly try it out. Let me break everything down... Venue: For some reason, Bottega Louie looks a lot like a Louis Vutton from the outside. Large glass windows with marble-esque detailing and touches of gold. Getting inside is kind of confusing. There are three entry/exit-ways: one next to the bakery area, one which is supposedly the main entrance next to the macarons, and one next to guests' tables (I would only consider this one an exit). I definitely tried getting in through the entrance/exit next to people eating, but I stared at them for a little, thought it was awkward, and went back to the entrance next to the macarons. Even finding the table to check-in at was confusing. It is no where near the front of the restaurant. The host/hostess table is smack dab in the middle of the restaurant. I'm not sure if I am the only one who thought that was random, but it was my first time seeing that. One things that really turned me off about the restaurant was how loud it was. I could Wait: We came at around 8:10pm and they told us the wait would be around 40 minutes for a party of two. Reasonable in my mind since the restaurant was packed and high in popularity. I really wish they had a waiting area with seats somewhere because standing for 40 minutes can be difficult for some individuals (elderly, specific disabilities, pregnant women, etc.). To pass the time, I took up the opportunity to snatch up a couple of their raved-about macarons (more about that later). When finding out if your table is ready, you have to come back to the host/hostess table yourself, they will not call you. So after about 30 minutes, my boyfriend and I made our way back and inquired whether our table was ready--it was! That cut out 10 minutes of our waiting time (major plus). Service: On point. Our server even unfolded and placed the napkin on our laps. I felt really bad, but if someone goes the whole nine yards and does that, they are doing to most to make you feel at home. Also, our water was always refilled. Food: Caesar Salad ($10)- Nothing special. About 5 whole leaves of lettuce with their own Caesar sauce on each leaf, croutons sprinkled around, and parmesan shavings on top. I liked really liked how there was enough dressing, but not too much for it to be over-bearing. Portobello Fries ($10)- Tried these since everyone else raved about them in their reviews. I must say that I was throughly impressed. The mushrooms we extremely thick and juicy with a crust that complimented the soft center. I could eat these with or without the sauce because they are that good. I'm recommending these to my friend who is crazy about mushrooms. I'm sure she'll easily fall in love. Chicken Paillard ($20)- I was really thankful for the flavorful taste of the chicken because it was kind of dry. It is really hard to maintain juiciness since the slice was so thin, but the dryness turned me off. The greens that it came with were plentiful, but kind of too bitter for my taste. Overall, the appetizers won my heart compared to the actual entre. Macarons (Box of 5 for $10.88)- Best macarons I've tasted. This is in comparison to Lette in Fashion Island and the giant macarons in San Diego. I used to think that I had a sweet tooth, but macarons have let me know that my sweet tooth has dulled down a lot. The sweetness of the macarons at 'Lette were WAY TOO SWEET. I died after one and didn't even want to finish the rest of the box. Bottega Louie's was the perfect amount of sweetness. My favorite was Grand Cru (dark chocolate ganache). AMAZING. The next time I go back I will make sure to get way more than one. Final Verdict: Marking Bottega Louie one star because of the nosiness.   I really want to mark it down one more star because I was a little disappointed in my main course, but the service, appetizers, and macarons are saving this rating.

Great place to eat and hang in DTLA. When you walked into the restaurant, a pretty dessert showcase is in front of you. Colorful macarons and small pastry make you feel hungry already.Seeing how they prepare salad and sandwich in the morden semi-open kitchen helps to kill some time. (there's always an hr wait during dinner time.) I have been this restaurant severl times for lunch, dinner, brunch and late-night snacks. I would like to share what I always order: Portobello fries - flavorful, crispy outside, soft inside Pizza - you can go with half & half, so try two different flavors at the same time Caesar salad - fresh romaine hearts, reggiano parmesan, love the freshness Club sandwich- french ham, turkey, smoked bacon, gruyère, tomato, avocado, hard-boiled egg & watercress Chocolate souffle - it's so delicious that I have to order it even when I was full. (be sure to order in advance. so dont need to wait for 30 mins.) A lot of people are fascinated by the color of the macarons and the pretty box; but I'm not really a big fan of their macarons. You can only taste the sugar but not flavor of the macarons. You can have better at "Lette".

-the "Mache salad" gets 3 stars.. it was just a typical salad with not enough crunch.. I heard that the chicken that is normally on it was pretty good.. However, I don't eat chicken so I got it without. -Portabello mushroom fries- too much crunch n breading but the basil aoli sauce was so amazing that I started dipping my bread into it haha. -Salmon- it was great. It was steamed in parchment paper with veggies, so it felt lean. -desserts were nothing special (i ordered 2 from the display and the grand macaroon)... but the macaroons are AMAZING. i got myself a medium sized box!

I came recently for dinner with my bf and really enjoyed my experience! I liked it a lot more than the last time I came a few years ago. We came on a Wed. night and it was packed! Thankfully we only had to wait about 10-15 min before we got seated though. We shared: - Bruschetta: I didn't think these were that great. The tomatoes and just everything was bland and a little overpriced if you ask me. - Portobello fries: SO GOOOD!! Definitely a must-get! I think it's seriously one of the best dishes here, and a unique one too! The taste and texture are perfect! I gobbled them up and I'm not even a mushroom fan. So good with the aioli! Get it! - Burrata Pizza. Yummy! We really enjoyed this pizza. It ain't no "Pizzeria Mozza" pizza but it's still pretty good! I liked the dough a lot more than I expected to. Service was super fast! Everyone was so in sync from our server to the people delivering the different dishes to the guy refilling our waters to the guy who cleaned up our table. Bottega Louie is definitely a well-oiled machine! And you can't come here without checking out the macarons! They raised the prices to now $2 each! Pretty pricey especially since they're so little! They have 13 different flavors and there is an option of getting a gift box of 13. Great gift idea for almost any girl! All the macarons look gorgeous together with their bright colors! Too bad these don't taste as good as they look (Can't beat Euro Pane & Bouchon)! Tip: put these macarons in the fridge overnight. I personally think they taste better that way when it's a little bit chewier, and not as mushy. :)

Madness during the weekend, but ironically I got a table for two after only waiting for 10 minutes.   Talk about good luck. The food was alright, but my favoirte were the portobello mushroom fries.  I can eat 2-3 orders of that in itself. The rest of the food was great in presenation and not bad in taste. This place is proof of the revitalizatoin of downtown LA and I couldn't be more proud being a native Angelino myself. =) Would highly recommend anyone to check this out at least once for the experience and to see the new LA.

I walk in with a lot of expectation as I was recommended by many people however it did not meet my expectation. It spoiled my friends farewell. I barely write a bad review however had to share my experience. As you get a table, you are served a complimentary French bread. We ordered the Fettucine Belmondo & Pomodoro Pasta and both of them were bland and not at all up-to the level of food we were expecting. The Portobello fries were good however too high on calories (fried food!!!). We saw many people ordering the Mushroom Pizza (assuming it might be good) but we resisted for the deserts. Tiramisu was highly okay. Among the various options of Macarons, I only liked the espresso one. The Matcha macaron was extra sweet. The place is an upscale (too noisy) one although located in LA Downtown. In all everything was so-so, may be will revisit this place and change my review if I find it satisfactory.

As a USC student, I've been here several times. At first I was turned off by the exorbitant prices and loud atmosphere. It's quite difficult to catch up with friends here because of the high ceilings that make it impossible to hear. But it's growing on me; just looking at the bakery makes me happy because all the treats are so pretty (even though everything is so dang expensive). Portobello fries are everything everyone is raving about. I couldn't believe they were mushrooms. Deep-fried deliciousness. I've tried the salmon - perfect tender texture and seasoning. I've also had this baked pasta - I think it's called trenne - I liked the crunch of the pasta but found it bland and lacking flavor.  I've also tried the bianco and clam pizzas. So impressed! Two slices and I'm good - the most economic option at this place. So filling and full of flavor. As for macaroons, my favorite flavors are earl grey, grand cru (dark choc), espresso, and rose. But they're all so yummy and pretty and colorful!

Disappointing. I came here for the macarons only and they were very underwhelming. Shells too dry, too little filling, macarons too small and overall they just didn't taste that great. However, the rose and passsionfruit macarons were very good. The Earl Grey macaron was boring and dry. Bleh, won't be coming back for macarons. Take your two bucks per macaron and head over to La Provence instead. You'll get much more bang for your buck there.

The restaurants' front door opens into a lovely bakery.  Absolutely beautiful items, breads, pastries, macaroons, candies, gifts and gift boxes, and already wrapped "to go" sandwiches.  First impression - WOW: the volume, and also for the beauty and size of the place.  It's massively HUGE, and seems to go on and on, and with vaulted ceilings, it reminds me of a gutted, and completely restored old bank.  Gorgeous in mostly white, brass, dark woods, and dark leather.  It's contemporary Italian, not classic. There's lots of commotion.  It's just after 1pm, and it's alarmingly loud even for an airplane.  People are scattered about, everywhere.  Standing, sitting at small tables, some waiting, and some eating.  I'm unable to actually see what to do, or know where to go.  So, like a star USC running back soon headed for the NFL, I weave thru the crowd.  With fervor, and motivated by hunger, I find my way using laser-like vision, and see a small line forming.  It's in the center of the room, not the front, the absolute center...and still, you have to look for it. Beautifully dressed, two hosts and two hostesses greet.  They are professional and elegant, and casting directors take note -- they're worthy of a look. Quoting 20 minutes for most newcomers, only 5 for lucky me (dining for 1 occasionally has some privileges). A table, close to one of the large windows facing 7th, right at the corner of Grand. With bright afternoon lighting, perfect. With paper-lining, the tabletop gets quickly assembled: small plates, real silverware, salt and pepper.  "Would you like flat or sparkling water?", the waitress asks.  I responded, "No thank you, Iced Tea."  I found out later the water, both flat and sparkling, are complimentary.  That's awesome. The menu is a large, laminated card.  It contains 9 sections, 3 to 8 items under each: salads, pizzas, pasta, appetizers, sides, soups, entrees, sandwiches, poultry, meats, and seafood; plus 30 kinds of small plates, appetizers, and sides.   The prices are moderate. Rachael, my server, short-cut and stylish blonde hair, seems proud to work here.  When explaining her favorites, or when answering my questions, she revels about the ingredients imported mostly from the homeland. For Italian restaurants, I judge a place completely by their meat sauce, and a second-place tie between the bread and how good their meatballs are.  While there are tons of things I liked on the menu, I chose the Tagliatelle Bolognese ($14).  No sooner that when I placed my order, a braided bread about a 10 inches long, twisted into easy to break 5 pieces, and served with a little ramekin of sweet butter.  My iced tea is served with a small plate of fresh lime, lemon, orange and a small glass pitcher of sugar syrup.   The bread disappointingly was not warm, but still -- perfectly baked and crusty, with just the right amount of soft center.  The butter, divine.  My meal was served super quickly within 7 minutes.  Without hesitation, I wrestled the "Parmesan guy" to the floor, but he too easily sequestered, and proceded to shred, over my entree, an amount of cheese like freshly covered, snow-capped mountains in the Italian Alps. The portion of pasta was generous, and fresh.  The cheese, perfect.  But this meat sauce was more sauce, than meat.  I added some salt.  Ate about 3/4 of it, and, of course, all the bread.  I already began to think about this as my midnight snack, and if it was necessary to hide it in the back corner of the second shelf in the fridge, so other wolves won't prey upon it.   I flirted with the 4 nicely dressed ladies next to me, hoping to get some...pizza that is.  Clearly, they were masters...ordering 3 large pizzas to share between them (I really liked their style).  Oh I was interested, but instead, got 8 thumbs up.  They highly recommend them, and yet - wouldn't share with me...pppmmmffff. Finishing off with an espresso, it was a lovely lunch.  A very impressive operation -- serving a lot of people, quickly and efficiently.  With all the loudness, it has the kind of electricity that makes you feel happy to just be here -- and that it's exactly where you are supposed to be.  Today, I felt like a writer who's writing about a place that should be written about. -- Second visit (5/14/2012): Emilee (a most awesome server), Sausage pizza (unreal, love the sauce and crust), and Short-rib Ragu (I've been born-again). -- Third visit (6/20/2012): Asked for Emilee, she was over-the-top awesome - funny, charming, just lovely.  Sausage pizza again, just had to re-live the moment again.  Bumped my overall rating from 4.0 to 5.0 - bar none.

Did not get to try pizza but it looked divine. Also, an incredible assortment of pastries and macaroons.  Be prepared to wait to be seated.

Trenne - VERY good. Definitely recommend. 5/5 Lasagna - Meh. 3/5 Onion gratinee (French Onion Soup) - I wouldn't recommend this. This is one of those few dishes that needs to be salty, but there's isn't at all. As such, it's pretty flavorless. 2/5 Overall, as good as that Trenne is, I probably wouldn't want to wait an hour to get it.

Next time I talk with Hugh I will bring this to his attention.

I was just floored when I walked into Bottega Louie. I had not idea what to expect and I was definitely surprised. I came here to meet up with friends for our Annual Christmas dinner and it was definitely one of the best dinners we have had. When you walk in, you are greeted with a massive bakery display filled with delectable treats that include: macaroons, tarts, little cakes, and other things. They also do chocolate and wine, which is always nice. As many reviewers have posted, there is usually a long line to get a table and its definitely noisy. However, while you are waiting, you can order drinks and appetizers at the seating area in front of the bar. I ordered a glass of a Rose and it was delicious. We also ordered an appetizer that is made with chilled  Mozzarella and Ricotta with Pesto and roasted cherry tomatoes. this is to die for. I had a wonderful wood fire Pizza and it was great. I saw everything else my friend's ate, but, alas, was not in my budget. This place is definitely pricey, but it seems worth it. Again, if you don't mind crowds and noise, this place is a great place to try.

I probably go to Bottega Louie too often... pretty much every other day for my morning/afternoon coffee fix and sometimes breakfast pastries too. I like to think I'm pretty picky with my coffees, and I absolutely hate (with a passion) Starbucks Coffee. I would walk 5+ blocks to get a better coffee even if I happen to be standing right in front of a Starbucks Coffee. I was just talking to a friend yesterday as we were waiting for our order - we both agreed that Bottega Louie has the best coffee around the area, and that we would buy their coffee beans if they sold them, preferably in their pretty pastel colored packaging! I reckon that would be a perfect gift to accompany their boxed macarons.

The pastries are amazing. The long wait to get a table is a little less amazing. I've been here twice and both times it was around 8 on a week day and getting a table took a while.  Which is fine.  The service was great and the food is pretty good.  The waiter was great with our vegan order and very helpful with the menu.  I'd would recommend not being starved when you come, because you will have to wait.

"I KNOW YOU'RE SITTING 3 FEET AWAY FROM ME BUT SAY THAT AGAIN... LOUDER!!! WHAAA?!? I STILL CAN'T HEAR YOU!!!  YOU KNOW WHAT, JUST TEXT ME THAT COMMENT." Don't get me wrong. The venue is beautiful (and so are all the servers), food is tasty, and the decadent dessert display is like food porn for your eyes, but what the 3000+ some odd reviews forget to mention is how incredibly loud this place is.  I came here with 2 of my girlfriends for dinner and although the dining experience was over all very nice, it was just so loud that I found myself straining to hear them. aH geez, I sound like an old fart. Moving on. One of the must haves here are the black and blue mojitos! DELISH although quite pricey. I think a mojito ran about $14 per drink.   Would I recommend this place as a romantic, quiet dinner?  Probably not.  For a first date sort of thing?  YES.  The noise of the restaurant will drown out all those awkward inbetween moments.

We went to Bottega Louie for my 25th birthday celebration.  We were a little dressier than most people, but not dressier than the staff, so it was fine.  The staff was extremely accomodating!!  We had 8 people, but Brittany handled us very well!  I had the lasagna and the moscato and it was all delicious.  Pretty much everyone loved their entrees.  We brought cupcakes to celebrate, and they did not have a cake cutting fee (yay!).  We also had a bunch of balloons... I tied them to my purse, and they didn't get in anyone's way.  I kept waiting for the staff to complain, but they did not!!!   Thank you Bottega Louie for making my 25th birthday (also my golden birthday) the best birthday I've ever had!

I have been here many times and have never once been disappointed.  The place is always INSANELY busy yet somehow you end up with great service, great food and the kind of experience that brings you back for more. Wil was our server and he was great, but honestly, I have never had less than five star service there. We had a party of four that shared too much food, my favorite being the very simple Pomodoro Pasta and the pizza that I order every time I'm there. You will wait have to wait for a table and will barely be able to hear your guests speak because of the noise, and yet you will be happy you were there.

My hundredth review-- and Bottega Louie is a certainly worthy! It's the Tiffany's of bakeries--signature pink boxes with ribbons and all! I love coming here. It's a little shop filled with towers of colorful macaroons and the most exquisite deserts and cake you'll find. My theory is that they set up the restaurant + bar + bakery in a way that fuels and perpetuates busyness. The hostess is stationed in the dead center of the entire place, with a busy bar to the left, a crowded bakery across from them and the chefs transparent kitchen to the right. Expect a wait, but spring for a quick macaroon at the bakery--there' a separate register. The hostesses here are too classy to give you a number or anything of the sort. Instead, they write down what you're wearing, find you, and escort you to your table. It's hard to get around but you can't help but stay mesmerized by their beautiful deserts and food. Their decor is simple and tasteful. Everything is white except the brick wall in the back where the pizza is freshly made. Though everything is white, the corners contain beautiful detailed carvings. If you're in LA-- go to Bottega Louie at least for desert! It's worth all the hype! Beware: parking is a pain (as is everywhere in LA). There's a $3 parking lot down the street and a $5 right next door. Hope you can find a meter though.

They don't take reservations which can be good on some occasions; however, not when it's a friday night. I'm guessing the bar was suppose to be the waiting area but that was packed too so everybody was just standing around blocking the way. It gets pretty suffocating but yet can't wait outside since they're always somebody asking for change by the door. They don't have any buzzers so the lady pretty much have to recognize you by face... the waiters I had were always friendly. the pizza and portebello fries are good. They are also great for sharing. I forgot which pasta my friend got, but you can definitely pass on that. The portion was small and didn't taste that great. overall, it wasn't bad but definitely not worth an hour wait. I'll just stick with buying the pastries to go.

After 2 years I finally woke up early to catch sunday morning brunch! My boyfriend and I went early like around 830am though they open at 9am for bunch thinking there might be a wait because they are popular for sunday morning brunch and parking is kind of hard to find. Well parking was easy because we were there so early and it was sunday so we didn't have to pay the meter. At 830am there was already like 20 people inside already eating whatever desserts or pastries they had and was serving coffee but they weren't seating people yet in the dining area. PROS: +2 Star - Our server was very nice and informative. Complimentary Flat or Sparking water.   Restrooms clean. +1 Star - MUST TRY EGGS BENEDICT! so delicious.   Portobello Mushroom fries was interesting the alioli sauce complements it real nice. CONS: Service: -2 Stars I asked the hostess if brunch started at 9 because there was a lot of people already seated, she said yes brunch started at 9 with a smug attitude. so at 845 i asked my boyfriend if he can ask the hostess if we can be seated early or we had to wait till 9am to be seated. (the reason why i ask my boyfriend to ask her because she was rude to me earlier) she told him we had to wait till 9. So at 9am people started lining up to be seated she asked for a name and how many people then asked us "Are you in a hurry?" (WITH A HUGE ATTITUDE) my boyfriend and I exchanged confused looks like why did she ask us that question. I said no and just brushed it off because luckily I was in a good mood. Food: I ordered Eggs Any Choice and I wanted my eggs Over Easy... one of my eggs was over easy the other eggs was slightly under done. I got a bad stomachache after that. The food we got was never "hot" it was always warm or almost cold. For instance my potatoes was defiantly not hot or warm so they were hard potatoes. The Portobello Fries was delicious and took 20 minutes to come out was warm to almost cold as well. I started to question if the food they serve was just "warm". The only thing hot we had was the coffee. Open spaces so very loud acoustics, it sounded like a cafeteria. Total Bill 63.00~ for 2 people JUST for Bunch. 2 appetizers 2 entrees 2 coffees Final Words. I waited 2 years to try this place and I just think it's just "okay" and it's something I can cross out in my list of restaurants to try list. I'll probably go back just for desserts or when I wake up early again.

Came here for Saturday brunch on an unusually rainy Saturday morning. A bellini and a Farmers Market breakfast followed by an espresso - the boyfee had the breakfast ravioli. Both were delicious, although it seems Bottega Louie has a serious hard on for poached eggs. This place is one of those big-room Euro style establishments that was made all the more European by the soggy weather and gray skies on that morning. I was very impressed by the service. Our waters stayed filled, and not in that annoying I'm-gonna-fill-this-water-whether-you-like-it-or-­not way and I feel like the servers paid just the right amount of attention to you. That being said, my brunch was good, but not amazing, but I am fully up for coming back to this place, especially for some macaroons and / or dinner. The setup also allows for a very loud dining experience. Not that I care, but loud is for techno clubs and Nascar races, not brunch.

If you like Mi Piace, then you will love Bottega Louie!  The ambience is great and their food compliments it very well. The best part of it all is their desert bar. You can have any thing from tarts to macarons. Their macarons by far seems to be closest thing you can get compared to the Laudres in France.

This place is beautifully done, the cakes and cafe section are straight out of a Kodak commercial. Food is outstanding, fresh ingredients and very tasty. Service was very good but on the downside the acoustics with the very high ceiling are terrible and all you can hear is the roar of everyone else's conversation. The other thing that really spoiled it for me was the bizarre collection of four snotty 'greeters' who looked like something out of a Baz Luhrmann freakshow and all had attitudes that frankly made me want to stab them. Why were there four of them? Perhaps they should have been on horseback.

- Macarons - I love how they have probably the most flavors in one setting and never run out. I truly feel that they must have a lot of confidence to never have enough macarons! The rose one (rarely seen) and the espresso (different from mocha) and earl grey (hello! gold sprinkled paper on top?) were few of my favorites. If you are ever in the town make sure to get some. Parking costs money so savor every bite!

Overall enjoyable but a few problems. Large group-tiny table. We had a group of 13 (9 adults, 3 kids and 1 baby) on a Monday night. Obviously not an easy group to accomodate but hey that's life. They didn't take reservations but said we should have no problem since it was a Monday night. We thought so too. Well, thank goodness I got there really early and put our name down. It got so packed that the line cooked like a Disneyland line by the time we left. We were seated at a round meant for no more than 8. One of my friends said he sat at the same table last time he was there with 6 people! We all hadn't seen each other in forever so we just decided to squish in. Good food-awful espresso. Portabello mushroom fries- yum Trenne pasta- good if you like crunchy fried pasta Pizza- pretty good margherita and sausage Lamb porterhouse- yum Prosciutto fruit plate-yum Shrimp salad- gave my friend the runs Lamb chop-good Mashed potatoes-forgettable Steak poivre-boring Macarons- salted caramel, espresso, mandarin, vanilla, earl grey- yum Creme brulee- yum(more vanilla bean than I have ever had in any creme brulee Giant macaron-yum Espresso- had to send it back. Muddy, bitter, barely warm plus served in giant latte cup WTH?? They messed up the check twice. They had run out of salted caramel macarons by the time we were leaving and getting a box :( But he gave me an extra one for free :)

Recommended by the hotel concierge so we could walk there. Beautiful space, stark walls allow focus to be on the food. The large windows make the space bright! The food was phenomenal! The lobster hash, lemon ricotta pancakes, beignets and quiche are ALL must haves! I'm going back tomorrow to buy the yummy pastries. Highly recommended.

The ambiance here is very appealing kind of like new york city, loud and fun i would say. You get all walks of life eating here from young college students to the odd tourist folks. Food here is good, kobe burger was satisfying but was missing something, i guess the cow needed more sapporo and a massage because the burger was just ok. The lasagna too was just ok nothing special, nevertheless i'd go back and eat here again. Macaroons were yummy btw.

What a gem in the middle of LA with the high ceilings, open dining area and colorful pastry display!  This is casual fine dining at it's best:  delicious food, great service and no snoot! I've had this place bookedmarked since forever... so we took a day off early and headed towards here for a lunch!   Friday lunch hour? Not a bad wait time!  Although the host was a little rushed, they were able to seat us within the 15 wait time and service from there was warm and welcoming.   Everything on the menu sounded delicious and love their prices!  Has anyone noticed the pink salt and pepper on the tables?  Nice touch.  I ordered the trenne pasta and the portabello mushrooms.  Let me just say, trenne sauce + the bread they hand out, yummo!  Lots of people had ordered pizzas and I know I'll be back to try those.   We made a quick stop by the macaron display before leaving, sampling a pink ganache and espresso macaron for the road.  If you haven't been here.... then what's stopping you?! I'm waiting for another reason to come back.

First time here was about a 5-minute wait...mind you it was on a weekday afternoon. The next few times I came here was dinner on a Saturday. I was definitely not looking forward to the hordes of bystanders lounging around the waiting area and bakery. Just imagining the overstuffed establishment already made my stomach turn but I had to suck it up. Who knows--maybe the wait wouldn't be so bad this time. And you know what? I was right after all. Though the bf and I had to wait, it was only for 10 minutes. Another time I came here was a birthday dinner with the girls and although it was pretty crowded the wait was only about 15-20 minutes as well. I guess I was just fortunate those times. The portobello fries are still a popular and appealing feat. Bravo Bottega Louie on such a delightful and not-so heavy appetizer! However, through prior experience the pizza isn't my preferred meal therefore I must try something new... My new love: the modena salad. At first I was standing by the kitchen watching one of the cooks prepare what looked to be a very lovely salad. She layered the freshly green butter lettuce accordingly on the white platter then drizzled pieces of goat cheese, shallots and candied walnuts on top. Something that looked so simple tasted so delicately refreshing. Goddamn it was good!! =) I've always been a caesar salad kinda girl but this salad just blew me away. I wish the portion was doubled because that's how much I LOVED it! I've always wanted to try a pasta dish here but it was so hard to choose which would be my first. If I lived in LA. I would dine here as often as I could but being that I have a love/hate relationship with the city that's not gonna happen anytime soon. The trenne caught my eye because of the braised prime rib eye. LOVE red meat =) This too was such a simple plate yet exhibiting a lot of flavors and textures that I enjoyed. Mind you--don't expect the consistency of your typical pasta dish. The trenne pasta is pan sauteed so it has a bit of a crispy taste to it but the broth it comes with is very flavorful and if you just let it soak in the broth it's actually quite good. The rib eye is also very tender and juicy. I've ordered this dish twice and it never ceases to disappoint my taste buds. Lastly, the DESSERTS!! Panna cotta: slightly sweet, smooth and creamy. Reminded me of an orange-sicle. Definitely took me back to my childhood--sitting on the lawn on a warm and sunny spring day =) Very lovely. Creme brulee: nothing out of the ordinary. Very creamy and sweet but just ok. Macarons: I wouldn't drive all the way here JUST for these babies. Though they're pretty good, they're also ridiculously expensive. I've sampled a few of their flavors. My favorites would have to be pistachio and lemon. They're not the BEST macarons I've ever had but they're not disappointing either. The price just turns me off. $2.00 each? Lord have mercy. I've bumped up this place from a 3 to a 4 because of the MODENA salad, TRENNE and PANNA COTTA. It's not so much a 5 for me because of the ridiculously loud ambiance and it's a pretty pricey place for someone that's BALLIN on a BUDGET but it's still a preferred place of mine once in awhile.

Only 4,000 reviews? Well allow me to chime in.  I love that it's one huge and sunny room with a classic Breakfast at Tiffany's sort of feel to it.  There's some grandeur here. It's noisy no doubt but remember, noisy allows you to goof off and laugh and act like yourself. I'll take noisy over quiet any day. The food is great. The pizza is surprisingly good (thin, crisp crust). If you have a kid, take them here if only to gaze at the dessert cases-- they're so colorful and beautiful.  But keep in mind, this is one of those places with $9 marshmallows. One little macaron is $2. Although eclairs with gold leaf are $3 -- so bargain there.  The staff is excellent. I actually asked for the manager recently just to tell him how awesome our server was -- and I have never done that before.  But this server went above and beyond for us. I love coming here for breakfast and then taking my kid to the library with cookie in hand. There's a wait on weekend mornings (15-30 mins) but it's worth it.

OKAY okay, I am now a die hard macaron fan! The first time I came to try their infamous macarons all that were left were lemon, lime, passionfruit, and rose. I was not convinced. But THIS TIME on my trip to LA I decided to go all out and get the 13 piece box just for myself! Since I went early in the morning all the flavors were available! Each time I tried a new flavor of macaron over the course of the week I was more and more impressed. I figured the key is to keep them refrigerated so that the filling stays chilled and firm. Some held well over a few days others became a little dry. But these happy little morsels with their crumbly shell, moist interior, and smooth ganache WON OVER MY HEART. I can't even determine a favorite anymore!!!! Though I did like vanilla, salted caramel, grand cru (dark chocolate), earl grey, pistachio, matcha, raspberry chocolate, orange chocolate, caffe, and rose...

I've been here a couple times. The food is definitely good. Pizzas are delicious. I actually came here most recently for brunch and and ordered the smoked salmon eggs benedict. It was surprisingly tasty. I LOVE the the earl grey macaron. Although the food is delightful, I've never been a fan of the environment. The restaurant looks really cool on the inside, but it is just SO loud. You have to either lean across the table and talk really close to the person you're eating with, or yell at them, or just sit in silence and enjoy the good food. Worth a visit, but it's not somewhere I would usually choose to go.

I traveled by train up to LA to check out my boyfriend's office and meet his work buddies. Bottega Louie is a BEAUTIFUL restaurant, with soaring white ceilings and gold fixtures. I felt as if I had walked into Willy Wonka's restaurant. The space is separated into three distinct areas: a cafe/bar, a restaurant and a high end patisserie at the front of the store. I drooled over the elaborate confections displayed at the front of the shop! We had drinks and pizzas and appetizers. Everything was delicious! The drinks were appropriately elaborate and full of unusual ingredients (as the current bar fashion dictates). The pizzas (mushroom and margherita) were big, hot and crispy! The brussel sprouts were savory with pistachio nuts! Service was prompt and polite.

Place took me by surprise. First place we stopped by to eat in LA. The pastries are close to the real patisseries in Paris but not quiet there. I was born and raised in Paris, so can spot the differences right away. The brunch menu on Sundays is amazing. The reg lunch menu wasn't too appealing to me, but breakfast and brunch is def the best.   4 stars because the cockiness and the way some waitress and hostess look down on some people and completely look like they HATE their jobs.  If I owned this fine establishments, the staff would def be top notch and those who do not smile or respect every single customer would get booted out.

Service is great considering how busy this place is. The thing great about this place is that it's really pretty inside. This is a good place to take a girl on a date. Buy her some macaroons on your way out & she may fall in love with you. Not as pricy as ppl say. It's def affordable!

We have been coming here for some time now, and I can remember when we first came across this place, it had this great downtown, classic feel to it that I have missed for so long.....  Be it NYC or Milan, it's got a distinct urban vibe that isn't trashy lounge with slutty orgy beds or tragic hipster pretentiousness with roaming Thomas Jane-like vagabonds lurking in dark corners... Located on the ground floor of a majestic downtown high rise, it's high ceilings with white walls in neoclassical style gives an instant sense of relief, as if you've entered into a temple of couth...and sugar.... No, really, the front area houses an enormous Patisserie, lined with every conceivable dessert and pastry imaginable....and to the side is a bread section equally tempting and a sandwich salad reach-in for your business, on-the-go types....which is a shame to have to leave such a pretty place. It really is a metropolitan venue, with several spheres of activity housed under one roof, it's an ordered chaos that is always lively, (if not noise deafening) but alway fun to people watch!!! What I loved the first time I dropped in;  I was walking downtown in the late morning, and from the corner, I saw thru the large panes of glass smartly dressed men and women seated in European cafe chairs and tables sipping cappuccinos and reading the newspaper.... HEAVEN!!  Intrigued, I went inside and was in amazement to the open aired ambience, to the left was a wonderful Cafe with a full Bar reminiscent of European setting. I didn't even care about the Dining Room in the back, I was just happy to sit down and enjoy a Cappuccino and Croissant! There's an interesting resurgence going on Downtown, almost a renaissance of activities that's shaping before your eyes...it's really cool to watch it happen real time!  It's almost as if it hasn't found itself yet, but that Downtown LA is heading towards the right direction with venues that have a solid sense of place, sans trend... Anyways, getting back to sitting in the Cafe, I love this area so much, I don't know why, but I get a kick out of spending time here-it must be because its located in such a dynamic area, it's by the the window, the bar, the patisserie and the open kitchen and I can see it all from my seat!  There is waiter service, which is an added plus, and the service is good!! (no disgruntled staff here) I was ready to order some breakfast items, but when I saw the menu, I knew I had to get more than that; their Lunch menu looked so amazing- i immediately asked my server what are the really great dishes- she pointed out the Portobello Fries and the Trenne Pasta. SOLD!!! So I had some reservations on how the Fries would taste, but after biting into the first one, I was hooked!  First of all their batter is perfect, and the Portobello soaks in all the oil that's truly satisfying; it comes with a basil, green goddess mayo that sends this side dish over the top!  It can be filling, so consider this a dish, otherwise you may overstuff yourself! After the Portobello Fries, I was ready for the next dish: The Trenne, triangular Penne that is pan fried to a crispy crunch, with Braised Prime Rib Eye and Tuscan Black Kale with Shaved Grana Parmesan on top. To say this is to die for is an understatement, the meat component is rich and decadent, it's balanced well with the greens and the cheese on top adds creaminess to the braised sauce that you want to drink out of the bowl, I could have this pasta dish everyday! I never miss an opportunity to order this dish and it has never disappointed me..... We have ventured out once in a while, ordering the Arancini, (Fried Rice Balls) the Pizza, (Fennel Sausage with Mozzarella, Grana Parmesan, Tomato Sauce and Oregano) and so on this occasion, we ordered the Meatball Parmesan Sliders, loaded with Tomato Sauce and Fresh Mozarella and a side of Kennebec French Fries. I have to say, some of these dishes are hit and misses, I enjoyed the Pizza and Arancini, the Meatball Sliders were alright.... Sometimes everything on the menu can't be a winner.. I wholeheartedly recommend going to Bottega Louie and having Lunch, Dinner, Dessert, Drink whatever, because it will be a welcome respite from your busy, hectic, overworked life and you will get that instant gratification that you were so seeking from the other facets of your life!!!   Ratings (Out of Five Stars) Food:          4.75 Ambience:  4.5 Service:       4.5

The portobello fries is really good.. Must eat it when its still warm.. Asparagus with poached egg.. first time having poached egg.. I like this dish... I would definitely ordered again... after i tried all their small dish :) We ordered half and half pizza.. sausage and artichoke.. its good.. not oily so I like it :) Chocolate souffle.. I'm not a big fan of chocolate souffle cuz I personally think its a very sweet dessert.. However, I would recommend ppl to order this. It taste good.   The restaurant environment looks cool cuz its open kitchen and its white.. But, its loud.. Definetely will come back to try more desserts and their food :)

The macarons here are beautiful, delicious, yet expensive. I came here on a Sunday and ordered the parfait. It was good but I wouldn't really recommend it if you are a person who likes a ton of yogurt with granola. This parfait lacked a lot of yogurt because basically I only got granola in my bowl. Nonetheless, the place is nice for a 21+ birthday since they have the bar, but stay away from the parfait!!

This place is a zoo! Crowds look daunting at first, but the wait goes by pretty quickly. By the time you grab your macarons your name will be called, trust me. All the employees here are dressed to impress. Meaning Vegas-style. For a minute there I thought I had somehow ended up in a Vegas nightclub. During the day. Eating brunch. Even though the ambiance and volume (due to the crazy high ceilings) was a bit of a turn off, the food ended up being delicious! Try their portobello mushroom fries, they are amazing. And Don't forget about their intricate slices of cake that probably took someone half an hour to painstakenly decorate and about 2 seconds for you to consume. Everything is on the pricey end, but this is definitely not your neighborhood mom and pop type of place. If you're still dressed in your clubbing attire from the night before, pop on over for a bite to eat before your walk of shame. You'll fit right in :)

My one and only experience here was just off...I'll probably only be back to get some macarons...even then I'm not so sure since I prefer 'Lette's macarons in general. Ambiance: might be a good place to come for a casual dinner with friends. But seeing as it's so LOUD, it's difficult to have a conversation without shouting at each other...must be the acoustics/high ceiling...with that being said, why do families bring their young children here?! I saw small kids here at 9:30pm while eating dinner...on a week night! Portabello fries: interesting concept making mushrooms into fries. The breading wasn't too thick, it wasn't too greasy, and the aoli was good Short ribs: wayyyyyyy too salty. The meat was braised well; nice and tender. But being so salty my boyfriend couldn't even finish his dish, even eating it with the white polenta. Trenne: when the menu says "pan sauteed tenne pasta" I wasn't expecting crispy and hard pasta. When did crispy become associated with a sauteed dish? My jaws hurt from eating the pasta. The only thing I enjoyed was the flavor and the braised prime rib eye. Service: now I have a really big bone to pick. My boyfriend tells the hostess that we were a party of 2; she kind of ignores us, doesn't tell us to wait or what to do. You don't ignore your customers when they need to know whether or not to step back and wait for the table to prepared! The biggest problem was our waitress. She went on break, so we started off with a different waiter. Everything was fine. Then she came back and introduced herself, said she would be helping us. She kept going to the table next to us to wait on them, but she never though to fill our waters. It took a good 10 minutes of sitting and watching her wait on other tables before we were able to flag her down for our check. Good grief. Macarons: Got a box of 5: Grand Cru (chocolate ganache), Earl Grey, Vanilla, Passion, Rose. Best one was the Earl Grey. The Rose wasn't as flavorful as I hoped. The outsides were a bit too crisp/hard too. Overall they were ok at $2/macaron; if I'm in downtown and I have a strong craving to get macarons, I might stop by again. But I still think 'Lette's are better. I've experienced way better service and food for the price we paid for dinner. I probably won't be coming here again. So disappointed; it's over-hyped.

Tooooooo noisy for a dinner place, gorgeous place and atmosphere but you cannot hear your dinner partners, you literally have to be shouting, and that's so the person next to you can hear you, and people across the table have to try to read your lips. Lol....that took 2 stars away for me, oh and the pizza was good, nothing to die or, but good. Next time I will come just to grab a dessert.

Their Portobello mushroom fries are a MUST-HAVE!  And who can forget their delicious desserts?  I'm not a fan of the macarons because...well, I don't really like macarons that much.  It's not BL, it's me! BL's food is delicious, but the portions are on the smaller side.  Don't come here too hungry either b/c sometimes the wait can be killer.

Bottega Louie (est. 2007) has been gracing the Los Angeles area and impressing people year after year.  Even though we are in a recession, this place is thriving! Let me break it down for you: [B] BOURGIOUS! Fancy shmancy Italian eatery, market (to-go food) and patisseries! [O] ONLY 1st COME 1st SERVE Seating. No reservations can be made here. AND if it's a poppin' night. Expect to wait from 45 mins to 1 hour. Don't worry, it'll be worth it! [T] THE PORTABELLO FRENCH FRIES - lovely cilantro aioli dip definitely compliments the fried goodness topped with some cheese! ($10) [T] THE CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE - is a nice way to end the meal. Give at least 20 minutes ahead for cooking time. The chocolate is light, fluffy, warm and not too sweet! Very simple, sexy and seductive. [E] EASY PARKING - Option 1: there's a public parking lot down Grand, which has standard rates ($6 daytime, but after 4pm daily it's $4). Option 2: parking on the streets (if it is available). Option 3: Valet (not always available). [G] GOLD, BLACK and WHITE MARBLE - the décor is simple, sleek and chic! [A] "AMAZING"! - what you'll think after you eat here! [L] LOUD - it would be difficult to hear someone talk across the dining table since the restaurant itself is quite noisy (from kitchen to all four corners of the place!). [O] OPEN KITCHEN - you can see your food being made while you wait to be seated! It's like a fish bowl! [U] URBAN - which is Latin for "city," the restaurant is located in the heart of DTLA [ I ] IMPRESSIVE - from food to atmosphere, you've got it all! [E] EAGER - how you'll feel after you've dined here, because you'll be back again! My dining experience at BL has been a gastronomical experience from start to finish and it was not just once, but twice, and a third when I took some dessert to-go. French macarons were $2.50 each and some can be on the sweet side and some were just pleasant. My favorites were the Earl Grey, Salted Caramel, Pistachio and Espresso. I highly recommend this place to those who are in the neighborhood, who'd like a girl's night out or just to catch up with friends. I don't know if this place would be great for a date since it's a bit too noisy for conversation. BL has won my heart!

Downtown LA is often a hit and miss.  You'll find chic hotels amongst random Macy's shopping centers and street level drug dealers. Bottega Louie is EXACTLY what this area needs.  Step inside and you're teleported to Paris where the Macaroons and wafting smell of fresh baked goods overwhelms your senses.  Take a trip around the corner and step up to the massive book where they still hand-write your name in their records for reservations.  Sit down at your table and your service is bound to be 3-star worthy.  The food is impeccable for such a quick-lunch hot-spot.  The fireplace enchants you while the staff flutters about tending to your every needs. Don't forget to pick up some tasty treats to-go on your way out.

Bottega Louise is very similar to how most people would describe LA - it looks beautiful but it's pretty darn shallow. Too good to be true - because it is. And I think that's why everyone I know with a vagina loves this place. I mean, look at that dessert bar they have. It's straight out of Polly Pocket. I wouldn't be surprised if they bake their $25/5" circumference cakes with an Easy Bake Oven. This place FEELS like what you would think a restaurant downtown should be. Large, on a corner over looking the most metropolitan part of this city and loud, If I wanted to get my friend black out drunk and trick him into thinking we were in NY or Italy, I'd bring him here. If I wanted to have a great meal, this wouldn't be the place. I've been a few times. Twice for dinner, a couple times for brunch. Yes - the portabello fries are great. If you're here and don't get those you lose. For dinner, I've tried the lasagna, a pizza and the pesto pasta. Nothing I've ever had was bad. In fact, some of the food I had was better than other versions that I've had. It's not terribly expensive but it's not terribly good either. Correction: it's NOT good. It's A-Ok (thanks Yelp!). For brunch, I had the breakfast flatbread which is actually like a breakfast pizza. I was expecting some form of lean benedict situation but I was double crossed by Louie! That fat bastard! And instead I received pizza bread with an egg, some cheese, prosciutto and arugula. Again - not bad. Just not very good. My last visit to BL was forced by a friend who was convinced this place had LA's best burger. Everyone clearly knows Rustic Canyon Wine Bar has LA's best burger but I thought I'd humor this guy. In no way no how was this the best burger. Was it a good burger? Yeah, it was alright. It was a well done fancy restaurant burger. It wasn't exactly cooked right, it was medium rare in some parts, not in others. It seemed like the type of burger someone from Guns N Roses would get served poolside at the Chateau in the 80s. Much like the other dishes at BL, it has the appearance of something great, but the taste of something mediocre. Come for the atmosphere, don't stay for the food.

I absolutely loved Bottega Louie, because it's an infusion of both Italian and French (so how they claim). I was there with a big group, and that all of us we're new to the place we ordered quite a lot and decided to split it. The Margherita Pizza was probably the best!!! Probably should be in the the top 10 best pizzas in Los Angeles. The arugula salad was perfect, the short ribs were packed with flavor, the Buratta and tomatoes were very very very fresh, the mussels were very very fresh, the calamari was great, the trenne pasta was average though. The pastries are down right some of the best I've had, because they're so fresh, sweet, and delicious. The Beignets are to die for, the eclairs are heavenly, and the chocolate soufflé is just out of this incredible(I was speechless really). The macarons I can't really say, because a lot of different restaurants tend to have the same taste, yet their très bien nevertheless l. Ohhh and let's not forget the delicious breads :D!!!  Le pain au fromage :))))))))

This is maybe the only place of it's kind in Los Angeles. Elegant dining hall in the very large ground floor / lobby space of a skyscraper building. This is unique to LA (which typically is much cozier and suburban). These extremely high double story ceilings make you feel like you're walking into a spacious marbled palace. it's a very.. New York, or European feel. Came here for brunch a few years ago which was a nice experience. Since it was Sunday, you could park anywhere. Else I hear parking is difficult. I've brought friends here for macarons, I guess they are known for that!

5 star for ambiance, 2 star for quality of food = 3.5 stars on Yelp. $20 for pizza, when you can get cheaper better tasting pizza down the street at Garage or Pizzanista.  The food wasn't horrible, just not worth what I paid for it.  Restaurant was well run and quite busy.  Nice place to bring a date if you want to show off that money doesn't matter to you.

I CANNOT believe I have not discovered this place earlier! I am so sad that I only found it after I moved to the east coast, but will definitely try my best to come back to Bottega every time I visit LA. I'm just very impressed by everything in Bottega. The setting is fantastic, the location is awesome, and Bottega offers an unparalleled dining experience... let me explain. The waiters here so awesome. Not only are they all really attractive, but they clearly pay a ton of attention to customer service, and it is much appreciated! I ordered the smoked salmon eggs benedict, which was great and I definitely recommend it. If you're here, you HAVE to get the portobello fries... they are one of a kind! And we got the chocolate souffle for dessert... the creme anglaise was sooooo good... we had to ask for more! In the end, this place is AMAZING, and I definitely recommend it if you've never been. Oh, and did I mention they sell macarons?? So good.....

The line-up to get in here is like a line-up into a nightclub. I almost expected a bouncer at the hostess stand and a bitch with a clipboard. But there was none of that, phew! Everyone here was really nice actually. I was lucky enough to bypass the line, which I was told was a 1.5 to 2 hour wait. Holy crap! Fortunately, I was there with someone who had name-dropping power so was seated almost immediately, and at one of the coveted corner tables - coveted because this place is freaking LOUD. On to the food. We 3 girls had: - Portobello Fries: Slightly overrated, but still good. - Grilled Artichokes: Ordinary. - Brussel Sprouts & Pistachios: So tasty. Absolutely delish, one of my faves of the night. - Lamb Porterhouse: Really good. This was recommended by our server when we found out the Duck Prosciutto we originally ordered was unavailable that night. He didn't ask us how we wanted it cooked unfortunately, so it came out medium well. I would've preferred medium rare, but still enjoyed it a lot - tender, juicy and nicely flavored. - Lasagna: Also came highly recommended by two servers on separate occasions, but was pretty average in my opinion. - Burrata/Prosciutto Pizza: Very good and had a surprisingly spicy kick. - Macarons: The salted caramel is amazing, and I liked the pistachio a lot too. Our server was extremely pleasant. He did mess up our wine orders, but no biggie. I loved the open kitchen, and watching pizza dough fling around in the air all evening. When we left hours later, the line to get in was still complete insanity. Although we all enjoyed the food and the energy here, we agreed that very few places are worthy of waiting in line for 2 hours and this is not one of them. It's good but not THAT good!

Finally made it out here. At first I thought it was somewhere high in the hills surrounded by malls and other upscale stores.  And to my surprise, its just around downtown LA and just a few steps away from the Mexican thrift shops. But once you walk in, it's open and spacious with white walls and columns.  The front opens with a pastry area with macarons and other goods.  To the left is a bar ready to pour you a glass of whiskey or anything that meets your thirst.  Excellent... Lunch/Brunch couldn't have been better.  Everything that came out looked about what you'd expect without any wowing factor.  The things that stood out was the pizza and lobster hash.  The pizza was light and had a nice thin crisp crust, and the lobster was just something different.  It's just a few chunks of meat, but nothing to write home about.  I would have been whatever with a benedict or what not.  The drinks and sparkling water was a fancy touch.  I can see why people come here, but what gets me is, why would anyone wait?  Its good, but not thattttt great to make it a near mission.  I'll admit though, the portabella mushrooms were pretty amazing and if I could just get an order to go or sit by the bar with one of those, I'd be satisfied with Bottega.   And for a large group, we were lucky to get a good seating.  The coffee: bleh, and the pancakes were decent.   The chocolates, which they were handing out samples of were delicious and I think they'd probably make a killing on the sweet aspect.  The regular meal service would have to take a backseat since the portabella fries is the only thing that sticks out.

The skinny on Bottega: - Parking sucks (no surprise, it's Downtown LA). I paid $6 at a lot right next to the restaurant. - The food portions are TINY while everything is EXPENSIVE. - Beautiful ambiance. - The dessert/bakery selection is extensive and impressive but still EXPENSIVE. - You're paying for ambiance, not necessarily food quality/taste.

The food is great, the waiters are very attentive, and despite being fine dining has probably the best burger in LA. The problem is the maitre'd/host.  Young lad, in his mid-late 20's, about 6', well dressed, and gets the medal for one of the THE most obnoxious and rude front desk personnel I've ever seen in action.  I've been here many times and every time I see him being rude to many of the people waiting in that long Friday night line.  On one particular night, I was fourth in line and I watched him be rude to every single person before me.  Everyone was polite and friendly and he wants to assert his position over them. As someone who takes clients out and doesn't hold back on the expense, I would give my opinion to the owners to get rid of this clown.  I'm sorry, but no matter how good the food is, how great the staff is, it takes one person to ruin the dining experience.  In this case, it's consistently the same person.

Location was awesome. Nice, casual setting for young people to hang out. Service was great, very nice and friendly. Not to mention the portabello fries was the bombb!! The kobe beef hamburger was to die for. Their filet minon steak was very soft and tender. Wasnt that special in my opinion. Macaroons and desserts are very eye catching, deliciously looking and tasting. Downside about the experience was the wait for 45 minutes for 2 people on a friday night. We got there at 9:00 and didnt get seated until 10:00.

Bottega has been on my list of bookmarks for a long time coming. It is the epitome of LA and pretty much sums up LA in a nutshell, especially downtown LA. We came on a Saturday night, peak dinner time at 7pm. We expected a wait, a loooong ridiculous wait. However, we were quoted an incorrect wait time. It's one of my pet peeves, because I could've used the time elsewhere, i.e. Seven Grand drinking a mint julep. We were quoted 45 minutes, and ended up waiting 1.5 hours. We ordered various items off the menu: Clam pizza Margherita pizza Caprese salad Trenne pasta - Pan sautéed trenné pasta with braised prime rib eye, Tuscan black kale & shaved Grana parmesan Clam linguini Short ribs entree - Braised beef short ribs served with lardon ragù, white polenta, sage & ricotta Portobello fries My favorite is their portobello fries and the short ribs. Amazing, both were so wonderful and I savored every fry. The dipping sauce that comes with the fries was so tasty! Their pizza were a big letdown. I was really looking forward to it, and it was not in any way good. Crust was chewy, not crispy. Pizza was dry and clams were overcooked. Flavorless. I am indifferent about their pasta. However, I am in love with their macarons. Earl grey, matcha green tea, and salted caramel were my favorites. $2 a macaron, pricey on the side of macarons but so damn good here. I want to come back to try their Brunch menu. I hear it's better than their Lunch/Dinner menu.

Came for for lunch the other day. Forgot how sucky parking can be in DTLA. I hate LA for that reason. But parked at a lot next to restaurant for $5. The wait wasn't long at all. About 10 minutes? The place is always busy. One thing that bothers me is that this place is so elevated that it gets realllly loud but it's whatevz. I was craving for them portobello fries! I didn't know their prices raised! :[ it used to be $9 I think.. now it's $10. LOL oh welps, still yummy in my tummy! We also started off with their Lyonnaise salad. Comes with Frisee lettuce, poached egg (MY FAVE!), bacon?, shallots+chives, and a warm red wine vinaigrette. Very tasty. As for the entree, we ordered a half mushroom half clam pizza. They were just okay. I was kind of disappointed because I've def had better. And our crust was hella burnt/black. -_- But it was still good. Just not great... The pizza was kind of chewy and soggy. Hard to take a bite 'cause of how chewy/soggy it was. =( For dessert, we ordered their vanilla bean custard creme brulee which was VERY delicious. I wanted to try their chocolate souffle =( They seem to change their dessert menu quite often. Booo... After lunch, I orderd some macarons to-go. It was my first time trying them =X ordered the pistachio, earl grey, espresso, matcha, and salted caramel. Earl grey and espresso was my favorite! Everything else was too sweet. Will come back again to try other stuff on their menu :) Maybe for some brunch over the weekend! :)

WOWSERS! Portobello fries are super yummy and a MUST to order if it's your first time here. First time we ordered the BURRATA pizza which is very good. Super thin crust and flavorful. Good for 1 if you can eat but also great to share with a date. 2nd time I got a 1/2 MARGHERITA and 1/2 BIANCO pizza which was delicious as well. Some people don't know that you can grab a seat right in front of the bar if you don't want to wait for a seat which could easily take 45min-1hr.

I love this place. I really really love this place! :) I went to Bottega Louie for the 2nd time with a friend who has never stepped foot in this restaurant, neither has she heard of it before and as soon as we walked through the door, she immediately gushed and said "I love this place". We sat down and she gushed again "I love this place". The waiter came by to give us our menu and she looked at the waiter, and very seriously said "I love your restaurant so much". Yes, she really did love the restaurant and she has vowed to return. We came here for brunch and ordered three highly recommended items. Lobster hash, the Smoked Salmon Benedict and the Lemon Riccota pancakes. She ordered coffee as well and claims it's the best she has ever tasted. The lobster has was splendidly delicious. So was the smoked salmon benedict, a bit on the salty side but great nevertheless. The lemon ricotta pancakes were to die for. They were soft and fluffy and even the syrup was ah-mazing! Parking was a breeze on a Saturday. We came by at around 10am, traffic was light and we parked at the parking structure right across the street for $4. You pay by credit card so don't worry if you do not have any cash in hand with you. I love Bottega Louie and I will bring my very close friends here to enjoy the food, the company and the very stylish look of the restaurant. Just simple and yet so grand.

I would like use my visit to Bottega Louie to dedicate my 1500th review to the main reason I so love Yelp - namely the awesome and unique friends that I've made thanks to what started off for me as a simple review website. Unlike Facebook, Yelp friends tend to be strangers on first acquaintance but a mutual love of good food, ingredients and a general passion for life and activites soon make for firm bonds of friendship, even across continents and oceans. Even better than that, when I now travel to the States, I have an awesome groups of ready-made foodie friends and a big thank you to all my Yelp friends who have hosted me in cities from New York  to LA. I hope you all know that you've got a standing invitation for a return visit to London anytime My only previous visit to LA before my return trip last September had left me a bit underwhelmed if truth be told. I felt that I never really got to the heart, the raison d'etre, the true locals' view and experience of LA. However, a little cajoling from Tony Y Jr Y persuaded me to give LA another chance with the special bonus of meeting up with good Yelp friends in the city Tony's suggestion of a meal at Bottega Louie was inspired as I think it represents exactly what LA is all about. There is no doubt good Italian food is on offer but it's much more than just a restaurant. There's an unmistakeable vibrant energy when you walk in the door and the cool and chic decor, staff, cocktails, patisserie counter and open plan pizza oven with chefs tossing pizza dough high in the air make this a place to be seen, to party, to mingle, to socialise as much as it is to eat. I now understand the LA buzz a little better after coming here Our little UYE was quite casual but brought together a few of my best Yelp friends who didn't know each other. Even more special was that Robin Z was going to bring along Gunner, a teddy bear I had sent on an important mission a few years ago when Robin and I first became friends Being the first to arrive, Teddy and I perused the most tempting array of macarons and other delicious looking pastries. Before long, we spotted Robin Z clutching Gunner and her friend Karen K. What I love about meeting good Yelp friends is that despite meeting for the first time, it feels like you've been friends forever and you just chat for hours. So, it turned out with Robin and Karen and before long, Tess M and Tony Y Jr Y joined the party. There is no pre-booking at Bottega Louie and you leave your details with the amazing Asian maitre d' with the photographic memory. There's no shouting of names and when your table comes up, she quietly dispatches a waitress to tell you that your table is ready and she tells them what you look like. Despite the place being busy, it didn't take long for our table to come up The menu featrued classic Italian dishes cooked to a high standard. Tony and I had the lasagne. It was perfectly balanced with pasta sheets, ragu and bechamel sauce all marrying in harmony to create possibly the best lasasgne I've ever had. The ladies' pizza was generous in both size and flavour. It's lovely to see that Yelpers are the same the world over with photos taken of the food and of each other. Despite being new friends, conversation flowed all evening and all too soon, it was time to go our separate ways. Sad hugs were exchanged with promises to keep in touch on-line. Gunner and Teddy shared a knowing teddy bear look and agreed that they'd had a blast Tony capped off an excellent evening by taking me on a tour of downtown LA and thanks to my Yelp friends, I now have a much better appreciation of LA Strictly on food alone, Bottega Louie gets 4 stars but my evening here with good Yelp friends was definitely a 5 star experience!

Delicious, albeit noisy, spot in downtown. I'd recommend coming here for lunch or a casual dinner, not for a romantic date or anything. This is probably the noisiest upscale place I've been to, although I suppose it might be part of the charm, what with its open kitchen and bakery area. Very interesting ambience. Great asparagus with poached egg, and potato pancakes. King salmon entree was good. Portobello fries are excellent. Beautiful macaron display--macarons are good, although perhaps not the best. Fav dish: asparagus with poached egg

Noisy, Noisy, Noisy, wrong place for a first date or any date... Food, Great, Great, Great. Sadly this place has slowly slid downhill from the open once the local hotels got wind and started sending in the riff raff by the boatload. Still, quality service and great food, just no longer the escape I had previously come to love in its earlier days.

This place is very nice and hip. A great place to go during the weekdays (Mon-Thurs) because the line is not too long. When I came the first time last year on a Fri night, my friends and I had to wait 45 min to get a table. This time around, there was no wait. Stepped up to the host and she gave us a table right away. The food we had: 1. Pizza two-ways: Half sausage and half mushroom. Their pizzas are freshly made. You can see the guys throwing the dough up in the air. A good start to a meal if you have a party of 4-6. I ended up having the leftovers for lunch today. 2. Clam Linguin -  The sauce was good. It came with 15 or so small clams. The portion is small, but enough for a small eater. 3. Short ribs - My favorite of the night. The meat was so moist and soft that it melts in your mouth with every bite. It was served over lardon ragu. Two glasses of Sauvignon Blanc Scarbolo Friuli 2009 was icing on the cake. The only negative part about this place is the noise level. I think it is probably due to the high ceiling. You have to shout across the table in order for your friend to hear you.

You have to try the Portobello Fries!! That is probably the only thing I can recommend. We also got a Pizza (which I think they're famous for). I don't remember what kind it was though. It was pretty good but for me, pizza is pizza. A bit on the pricier side though. I basically love this place for the atmosphere and decor. I am a sucker for restaurants with great interior design. They sell macarons and other desserts in the front that are really cutely wrapped (and delicious)! I love how bright and airy it is inside. Cute tables and chairs- simple and elegant. Service is really good and parking is convenient.

Bottega Louie seems to be to LA what the 53rd St. and 6th Ave halaal cart is to NYC, in terms of Yelp review popularity, certainly not in terms of fancy schmancy dining style. what is there to say after 3000+ reviews? Not much, so I'll keep it terse! A first. :) First impression: tourist trap with the beauty of the macaroons displayed for all to marvel at and photograph upon entry into the restaurant Service: EXCELLENT! Seated right away. All waitstaff incredibly friendly. Napkins re-folded as soon as you step away to the bathroom. Water refilled throughout meal. Food: Ordered the Burratta white pizza w broccoli and prosciutto, a hint of spicyness. Enough to split between 4 gals, two slices each. Good, thin crust pizza, not too greasy. Chocolate souffle: could've used more melted ice cream to pour into the chocolate souffle, a bit dry. I've just had better elsewhere. Butterscotch budino: tasted so strongly of caramel. Too sweet for me with the chantilly whipped cream. Macaroons: Pistachio and Earl Grey tasted the same to me except that the EG macaroon had glittery bling to its exterior. Salted caramel: Disliked Egg nog: they were all out; wish I could've tried this one! Tried another one which was reddish colored but I didn't like that one either, didn't even finish my quarter portion. Their macaroons are a bit dry and chewy. I prefer my macaroons more moist, as I do with my cupcakes. I wonder if the macaroons taste better first thing in the morn!

I honestly think this place is over-hyped.  I brought my mom here for brunch while we were in LA and she kind of hated it.   First of all, whoever designed this place did a poor job.  All you see is white white white everywhere.  I would've put up at least a couple of paintings or splashed in a bright color, like yellow, somewhere.  My parents are both architects so it's the first thing my mom noticed.  Huge walls/ceilings and then a tiny little hallway for the restrooms - looks off.  And the acoustics in here are awful.  You literally have to almost scream in order to hear each other.  It was not the relaxing brunch I had imagined.  I definitely don't recommend bringing anyone over the age of 35 here or anyone hard of hearing.   We came in at around 12 p.m. and were told it would be a 20 minute wait.  So we put our name in and took a walk while we waited.  We were seated within 15 minutes and greeted promptly by our server, Jim.  He was friendly and did his job well.  My mom and I decided to split a salad and split a sandwich.  Jim recommended that we start with the salad, which was a great suggestion.  The salad was amazing.  We had the Modena which came with butter lettuce, candied walnuts, goat cheese, shallots, and a balsamic vinaigrette.  The table next to us stopped mid conversation to stare at our pretty salad.  As for the sandwich we ordered the Club and it was nothing special - at all.  We totally regret getting it.  I ended up getting it boxed up and brought it home for my fiance. As for drinks - I like that they give you complimentary sparkling water.  I also ordered a glass of the Stags Leap Chardonnay, which was pricey at $18/glass.  It is kind of nice that they give you the option of buying half a glass of wine too.  But I stuck with a full.   All in all, I don't think I'll be back to sit down for a meal.  I much prefer a quiet setting with a nice patio.  We might be back to grab some macaroons to go, but that's it!

I felt like Alice in Wonderland, and I had fallen down the rabbit hole.  Every macaron and pastry had a 'EAT ME' tag on it. The macarons are not labeled, so make sure you really listen when they tell you the flavors.  When i had to ask twice because i was still bewildered at the huge selection, the waitress ROLLED HER EYES at me!!!. EXCUSE ME?! i'm not asking you to make a macaroon from scratch, i'm asking you to simply utter words.  If opening your mouth is such a hassle to you, find another industry, missy!  My friend reported her to the manager, and we got a free muffin, and 2 cupcakes...howlla at customer service. Tasty macaroons, earl grey was my favorite. Surprisingly, the free muffin was the highlight.  It was so plain looking, but don't let looks fool you. It is so moist and flavorful!! So don't be blindsided by the colorful macarons and the cute cupcakes, try the plain-jane looking muffin. you'll be sure to thank me. They also pack their goods in cute, pink boxes, so fellas...if you ever piss your lady friends off, swing by and grab a box.  I guarantee at least a tiny smirk. The place was huge, there was a section for their pastries, and another dining section for the restaurant.  The place looked like the Easter bunny had thrown up all over it with its' light pastel colors.  A very trendy place, and one I have bookmarked as a potential spot for a birthday or celebration. 4 macaroons + 1 cupcake : $11

This place is absolutely impressive!!!! The dessert are really really really gorgeous!!!! the chocolate souffle and the creme brulee macaroon are the must!!!!! However, i would say it would be perfect if they improve their kitchen ventilation and turn down the music a bit!!!!!! In general, i would highly recommend this place to anyone!!!!!!

Parking: Across the street for 4 bucks or right next to it for 5 bucks for 2 hours? So if you are a chicken that doesn't want to cross the street, you have options if you got dough. Tip: You have to walk in to the middle to put your name down. Wear something noticeable cause they will try to find you by looking for you (bad way to call / seat your guest). So wear a monocle or have a walking stick or something to stand out LOL. This place gets crowded really quickly, so come here early or be prepared to sit down early. I came here on Saturday afternoon for brunch. The people there told me 10 to 15 minute wait, so went to the bakery side to grab some macarons. Waited for about an hour to be seated. I asked them 45 minutes in where I was on the list. They told me 3 people are before me. 15 minutes later I guess they noticed I waited for a while so they told me if I put my name down. They seated me since they said I didn't put my name down. Was WTF but hey I give them props for finding people by describing their clothes in a sentence in their book. The food was really expensive. I got the SALMON MILLEFEUILLE freaking good but wow the smoked salmon was cut so thinly. It tasted like a salmon bagel on a flakey croissant. My friend got the EGGS BENEDICT. We both thought it was alright. A bit too heavy for what it is. Probably too much sauce and too much cream. We got a shared PORTEBELLO MUSHROOM FRIES since the waiter suggested it. It was interesting but wouldn't get it again. It tastes good the first five minutes in. After it cooled down, it tasted like batter. So pretty much slathered it in aioli sauce. So I recommend if you do get it, definitely eat it quick. The MACARONS were 2 bucks each. Order 5 and you get a box. haha here is what I got Earl grey: BEST ONE! Matcha: Tastes pretty good. Rose: Very heavy rose taste Caramel: Tasted chocolatey and caramely at the same time. Dark Chocolate: tasted like a chocolate cake If you come here, definitely wear something that stands out like a top hat or a mustache. LOL

If you like being where everybody else is, this is your place.  It's been open a while now, but still packs them in.   Service: impeccable.   Food: quite good, maybe great.   Atmosphere: High school cafeteria or gymnasium.   Okay, maybe that last bit's not quite fair.  But really, the space is a giant rectangular box with hard white walls, floor, and ceiling.  Nothing like a romantic dinner for two as you shout at your inamorata over the echoing din of the other diners.  However, one advantage of the open space is that you can watch the action in the kitchen, or at the pizza oven, during your wait for a table. Oh, and you lose another star for not having vin santo on your dessert menu.  Italian restaurant indeed.  I sniff haughtily at you.  Sniff.

Pros: Delicious food (and I'm a serious foodie), attentive service, stylish atmosphere, great drinks, home made pastries are divine.  Great for people watching. Cons: * Extremely loud at all times. *  Parking is... downtown.  So don't wear heals unless you are used to them.   - I recommend sitting at the bar if you would like to engage in conversation. Despite their large, homemade pastry options, this is not really a place for children other than a quick stop.

There are over 4,000 reviews for this place, so just a simple review here. Things you MUST try here: (1) Portobello fries. (2) Any of the pizzas, especially Burrata & Bianco. In fact, you can ask for a pizza that is half & half. THIS is probably the best tip here! (3) The pastas are also very good. I especially liked the pan sauteed Trenne. (4) Salted caramel macarons on the way out. Chocolate chip cookies are another great option. Evenings & Weekends can get crowded. The front half of the restaurant on the bakery side is first come, first serve. And you get the full menu there as well. Use your eagle eyes and scout for a table. I'd give it 4.5 stars. Since I can't do 1/2 stars here, I was leaning more towards 4 than 5, but there's really nothing that I'd change about this restaurant. So 5 it is.

I've been here twice before, but I don't remember what I ate or how it tasted like. So that would be completely useless. The most recent trip down to Bottega Louie was strictly for desserts. We came on a Friday night, so everyone can imagine how crowded this place already was. Luckily we were able to find an open table at the bar right of the bat. Now, my fiance and I opted out of their famous macrons. Surprise! We're both not huge fans, so we settled for their cake selections instead. We got the passion fruit tart, tiramisu, and vanilla creme with raspberries (comes with the huge macrons looking shell). The prices are $4, $7, and $8 respectfully. We obviously expected the more expensive ones to taste better, but the passion fruit tart was AMAZING. The other two were good, but didn't think it was worth it for the price. I will have to return and re-try their food. I'll be back! :)

Okay we had a bad experience. 4 of us went before an Opera but the wait was so long (nearly an hour) although we were told 15-20 minutes, that we had to leave for the performance before eating! The staff was very apologetic so we came back after the performance and we were very pleasantly surprised. A bunch if the staff remembered us and all of them thanked us for coming back, even a manager. We were sat with almost no wait and they gave us some free apps right away. Definitely a wonderful and thoughtful staff in addition to pretty good (not amazing) food and a cool open and busy atmosphere. Feels very New York.

I come here occasionally with my friends. We've had dinner and we usually just stop by for the amazing and delicious macarons! Tonight I stopped by and ordered a box of 5 macarons and I ordered two singles. The guy who took care of my order forgot about the two singles and when the cashier rung me up, the cashier told the guy that I had a missing order so then he gave me two free macarons because he forgot! He was so nice and very friendly! I love Bottega Louie!! My only complaint is parking! I'm not surprised at how busy it gets but I had to park down on 9th Street and Grand Ave and it was 830PM and I was alone! haha

Arrrhhhh ... Their portobello fries - I was very overwhelmed eating them!!! How could fried mushrooms taste that awesome!!!!!!!! 3 of us shared a pizza (you can have 2 different toppings) - artichoke and pepperoni. The pizza was good ... But not 4-star goodness. I regretted not ordering their pasta! Chocolate soufflé - there was a standard 20-min wait for it ... So if u are in a hurry, order it when you are about to finish your entree! This chocolate souffle was so made to impress and tantalise. It was not overly sweet - which gave a nice contrast to the vanilla cream! Finally - the macaroons - I really like the violet cassis, matcha and Earl grey flavours. I have tried quite a few macaroon places - Louie's macaroons are pretty up there. And this restaurant is so classy!!! Dress up to impress! Cute-looking servers and hosts/hostesses too!

I've had so many friends rave about this place and their macarons, so I finally had the opportunity to go for a friend's birthday lunch.  At first, I was a little peeved since we went on a Saturday, which served brunch until 3:00 pm (I was a little annoyed since I was expecting lunch, but it was alright). Anyways, the exterior of the restaurant wasn't exactly the nicest since it was Downtown L.A. (there were a few crazy people hanging around...yelling outside with hobos), but the interior was stunning. High ceilings with crisp white walls.  Also, it didn't take long to get a table, so that was a plus.  Our waiter was very attentive and spoke exceedingly fast--I almost didn't catch a single word he said!  We had portobello fries as an appetizer, which tasted heavenly with a cream sauce.  For a main course, my friends and I all had the ravioli, and I must warn you, it was a bit misleading, although it was probably just due to our expectations.  We had expected their ravioli to be a plate of ravioli swimming in red sauce, not...a single ravioli.  Although the ravioli tasted pretty okay, it wasn't anything to cry over. We then proceeded onto dessert, which was tiramisu and creme brulee. And let me just say, I love creme brulee (I love almost all French foods as a francophile!).  The creme was pleasantly warm and I could taste the various spices melting in my mouth.  However, it was not a generous portion at all, especially for its price. The food was alright, but not worth its price I think.  I didn't leave Bottega Louie full, but I did leave with the experience.  And it is one of the few joints with macarons in L.A.!

If you've been downtown, you've seen Bottega Louie. I have to admit I've only been here for dessert but that's incentive enough to come back and eat here for realz. PACKED and fairly pricey, but that's part of the classy downtown LA appeal. Favourite Macaroons: passionfruit, grand cru (dark chocolate), and vanilla. Honestly, if you're in the area, just take a gander at their display and you'll get an immediate dessert boner.

Where do I begin there is over 3,000 reviews for this place? Obviously they are doing something right!  I have been here a few times now. I have loved each time. The reason why I knocked off a star was the pricing on some of their items. This isn't beverly hills people come on. Parking= anywhere in downtown is a hassle park(valet at night) in the lot right next to it $6. Right when you walk in the door you get a rush of loudness & bakery smells. They have changed the market area up a bit to more quicker grab items. Salds Drinks, & really good sandwiches. I have gotten 2 togo sandwiches $6 each (yes pricey) & both were amazing the -French Ham & triple Cream brie with cornichons, & The Proscuitto, Burrata & Arugula Sandwich. The FRENCH Ham was my fav my son loved both & he's only 4! The bakery area has delicious yet very expensive overly priced breads, pastries & macarons! The sweets I have bought & tried are: -The Beignets which are located above the French Macaron area $1.50 each The chocolate(filled with nutella) & the rasberry. Both were delicious but I lovedd the rasberry more! -Peanut butter terrine $9= I had to split this with my friend because it was so pricey & small for what it was. Was not worth $9 believe me! It was yes delcious by all means but nothing extravegant. Tasted like peanut butter mouse(inside) with a chocolate shell. -Lemon Tart = $6.50 I really liked this tart but only the filling I did not care for the crust. The filling was very tart which I loved. Still this too was overpriced for what it was! -Passion Fruit Tart $6.50= I was not blown away by this either. The filling don't get me wrong was amazing! smooth tarty passionfruity but the crust was a overwhelming chocolate crust did NOT compliment the tart at all! -Hazelnut macaron tart $8= This was just ok for me. The center was delciously hazelnutty & crunchy & smooth at the same time. Rasberries were uneccesary on them & the macaron part was semi soggy PASS -Chocolate Peanut Tart$6.50 This by far was my fav wow perfect milk chocolate, crunchy crust the center filled with fleur de sel caramel yum well worth the sinfull ness. Topped with edible (taseless) gold & a few peanuts! -Passionfruit pudding/cups$5.50. This to was just good for me. The chocolate at the bottom was pure smooth & delicious yet again I find did Not compliment the passionfruit flavor. The filling of passionfruit was amazing, I could do without the rasberries in their. The crunchy white chocoalte pearls were a delcious addition though! -Butterscotch pudding$5.50- yes pricey for what it is, Tasted just like a Salted Caramel pudding. smooth creamy delicious I highly recommend this. -Macarons $2 each= PLEASE PLEASE SKIP THESE I dont know why they are reaved about here. But I have a very refined palate & Bottegas are not top of the line deicious pretty bland & expensive at that matter. I highley recommend 'Lettes Macarons which Taste the closest to France for me & are amazing in the flavor selections too! ON to the Restaurant part now. My Latest time I came We had the waiter Tony He was super nice & the way a server should be Checked up on us several times & let us enjoy our meal at the same time. The foods I have tried are -Portobello Mushroom Fries$10= Bottega staple These were light & delcious not thattttt heavy for being fried. sprinkled with some parmesan shreds & served with a delicious pesto aioli! -Tomato Soup$8 -garlic crouton,basil,creme fraiche,fleur de sel, Extravirgin olive oil.= Sounds amazing right? WRONG! don't be fooled like I did. This litteraly tasted like an overly acidic Marinara sauce & semi chunky at that matter THIS is A MAJOR SKIP! -Modena Salad $12 butter lettuce, candied walnuts, creamy balsamic, goat cheese.= I loved this salad perfect balance of everything the salty the cunchy the tangy & slighty sweet! -Cauliflower veloute $8 cauliflower, fennel & balsamic= This was a very well made soup. Not eavy at all & reall smooth! -Polenta with mushroom ragu$8= The mushrooms & sauce were amazing. The polenta itself looked like mashed potatoes, didnt taste like polenta to me either more like a grits but veryyy mush smoother. I would not pay $8 again for this unless it was for the side of mushrooms & gravy sauce. -Fettuccine Belmondo $12 housemade pasta, cherry tomato, garlic, arugula, reggianio cheese, extra virgin olive oil= This was just good tasting. Everything was fresh & top wuality ingredients but I can so make this at home for $12 I wouldn't get this again. - Pizza $18 1/2 Mushroom pizza  & 1/2 Burrata Pizza= Mushroom Pizza=Fontina cheese, fresh mozzarella, crème fraîche, shiitake mushrooms, garlic & Italian parsley. Burrata Pizza=Burrata, Grana parmesan, rapini, garlic, extra virgin olive oil & prosciutto di Parma= SPLIT The pizzas here they are hugeeee! The Mushroom was amazing. Skip the Burrata too bitter from the Rapini! Since I have exceeded yelps word count cant finish

Holy cow. Bottega Louie is a real challenge to accurately review.  We still don't know what it's trying to be.  A fancy bakery? hipster bar? or a high end restaurant?  Whatever it is, the combination makes it somewhat chaotic and uncomfortable place to eat. Walking into Bottega Louie, you'll first notice the beautiful colors of the macarons, then you see all the people, then you'll realize you can't hear the person next to you. It's pretty darn loud in there.  We got in line to put our name down and started preparing ourselves for the long wait but luckily a table opened up right next to us.  We sat down and within a few minutes we ordered our food. SCORE!  We thought that was going to take two hours! We ordered. portobello fries $10 pork chop-grilled prime pork, grilled onions & apples served with a house made applesauce $20 trenne-pan sauteed trenne pasta with braised prime rib eye, tuscan black kale & shaved grana parmesan $16 We had a friendly shouting match with our friends as we waited for our food. After a short lived conversation filled with, "What?" and, Huh?" we decided to people watch. The food came out and the sound mass of people seemed to disappear once we took our first bite. The food was good, really good. Hands down the best Pork Chop we've had.  It had a generous cut, a ton of juice and flavor galore.  Paired with the potato crisps and the grilled onion, it was outstanding.  The trenne pasta was more like a delicious beef soup and the portobello fries were great in moderation. Overall Bottega Louie is a solid three stars but because that pork chop was so above and beyond in taste and quality we're giving this acoustic nightmare 4 stars :)

Don't you just hate it when you pick up a slice of pizza and all the toppings fall off because the crust is so limber it acts like a slide? Well I sure do! Fortunately, this is not the case for pizzas at Bottega Louie. My friend and I came at 6pm to beat the dinner rush, and were seated immediately. Marco was our server, who was super nice, gave us a few suggestions. We ordered the Modena salad, Portobello fries and clam pizza. The Modena salad had butter leaf lettuce topped with candied walnuts, goat cheese, & shallots, and was drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette. This was good, although not the lightest salad since there were the walnuts and cheese. The highly-hyped Portobello fries fell short. We both agreed that the batter was too thick and resembled fried chicken batter. It wasn't too salty or anything, but we felt the taste of mushroom was lacking as the fries were thinly sliced. The aioli did not help either since it just masked the mushroom flavour even more. After a slow start for the palette, the clam pizza arrived. This was my favourite dish of the night! The 16" pizza was topped with mozzarella and pecorino Romano, roasted yellow bell peppers, thyme, garlic & of course, clams. There was just the right amount of cheese, which was browned nicely. The garlic was not overpowering, and the bell peppers were sweet & soft. The best part was the large & plentiful surf clams! These tender sea creatures were amazing! The second best part of this pizza was its thin dough. It was paper thin, with a nice crust, and had a great crisp that held up all the toppings. The crust was even tasty by itself. Lastly, we ordered the chocolate soufflé. Even though we were already full, we just couldn't resist. We rested our stomachs for a mere 20 minutes and soon the soufflé came out piping hot. The server pierced the top and poured the vanilla crème anglaise in the middle. The soufflé was chocolately, but not too rich that you couldn't eat more than one bite. It was not too sweet and we really enjoyed this. Bottega Louie employs so many servers that service is never lacking. Someone is always glad to help. In fact, about four different people help our table without us even asking. Everyone was really friendly and provided great service. We were asked whether we wanted all three dishes together, or have the fries and salad come out first. Our server also reminded us that the chocolate soufflé would take approximately 15-20 minutes and asked if we were okay with that. He even refilled our waters albeit each table is given their own bottle of water.

GREAT VALUE! Bottega Louie doesn't take reservations, so be prepared to wait for a while if you show up during peak hours.  Thankfully, there is a bar in the waiting area, so you can relax with a drink if you can find an open seat, but if it's brunch time and too early for a drink, there isn't much to do except just wait and people watch. FOOD/DRINKS:  I recommend getting the portobello fries to start with.  I am not a huge fan of mushrooms normally, but the portobello fries are too good to miss.  The pizzas are also great.  They make them fresh in their brick oven in the back.  I shared the margherita and the clam pizzas with friends, and both of the pizzas were delicious.  The complimentary sparkling water is also a very nice touch. SETTING/ATMOSPHERE: Bottega Louie is beautiful inside and out with high ceilings, white walls with a marble-looking floor.  The only problem is that with all the open space and hard surfaces, it gets pretty loud inside. Bottega Louie also serves excellent brunch.  Going at any time of day is a treat, and it's almost always busy.  I highly recommend checking it out for any meal!

Oh my gosh!  I loved this place!  Maybe it was the great company, maybe it was the fun conversations, coulda been the fantastic customer service or the awesome food...  I dunno.  I just loved everything about my experience at Bottega Louie. For starters, I found a parking lot a couple of blocks away that was only $3 after 4pm.  Yay!  We got to BL at around 6:30pm and got seated within minutes.  We started off with some drinks.  I first had the Buona Sera and it was nice and refreshing, the only thing i didn't like too much was that it seemed like it had a mountain of ice.  I felt the drink got watered down quickly...  Next, I tried the Moulin Rouge martini. It was just delicious!  I loved the fresh rasberry in the drink. For dinner, I tried the burrata pizza and the portobello fries.  The pizza was soooo good.  It was so full of flavor.  The burrata and prosciutto made for a great combination.  I was a little hesitant to have it with the rapini since I had read some reviews saying it was too spicy but I was glad I had the pizza as is.  It was bite after bite of deliciousness...  The portobello fries were so yummy as well.  They were everything I hoped they'd be.  The aioli they served with the fries was like the cherry on top. I picked up a few macarons and beignets for home and those were also yummy... All in all, I would most definitely come back.  There are so many other items on the lunch/dinner menu that I'd like to try as well as their brunch.  Untill then Bottega Louie...  :)

I totally dig this place. Stunning in its simple, fresh, modern elegance. Surprising that this is in L.A. The level of noise doesn't even bother me. It couldn't hold a candle to a dinner at my parent's house. The penne gambe was reminiscent of what my Mom makes. Mom was in luv with the Arugula salad. Bruschetta was a nice and refreshing start to lunch. And the complimentary bread. I would pay. No doubt. Closest to a real French baguette I've had in a long long time. And that freakin butter. Next time I'm asking for another to slather on my face at home. Yes, these are the necessities in my life. As my exquisite date, my Mom thoroughly enjoyed herself. Service was to a T. Perfect in every way. I'll soon be a regular. Like the thousands of others. Listen, just take me here everyday...And I'll be your best friend :)

The voracity with which I had to shit shortly after eating aptly summarizes my thoughts on Bottega Louie. While evoking the grandeur of a King's personal dining hall, the portions are many things, but grand they are not.  However, the opulence starts before the portions, from the moment you enter to a cacophony of noise akin to the NY Stock Exchange. After settling into the auditory hell, the real 80's comedy begins. It's not all about size, right? Well, I wouldn't know, but I can say in the case of B.L. that my friend's Ravioli would not satisfy the belly of a 6 year old. My Farmer's Market Breakfast did a better job, but not by much. The pizza that we ordered after because we were obviously still hungry certainly tasted good but not amazing.  Not if you've been to the handful of great Italian restaurants around LA. They are few, but they are powerful.  Thing is, the Ravioli is in the "Brunch" area of the menu (not appetizer or A La Carte).  It sits there just across from Steak & Eggs followed by Belgian Waffles.  Meaning, you should not desire a full pizza after eating it. So now you say, "well maybe you guys are fat pigs not fitting of our hifalutin dining." Nope. We're both fairly skinny and not big eaters actually. Most comically minuscule even more than the portions was the table itself.  Bring in Steve Martin dressed in a white suit, eating at a completely white restaurant; the walls, the floor, the patrons.  But not the tragically homeless, wheelchair bound, neck-tattooed skaters strolling past the floor-to-ceiling glass windows sneering in at our pure, exposed, decadence while on their way to a far more economically sound $4.00 burrito. Steve than must fumble with coffee & saucer plate in one hand while eating a potato with the other, all while using his foot to keep a glass bottle of water from slipping off the table. Luckily, our table had a 3rd chair.  Though not by any means possible to have a 3rd person, this chair worked great as additional table space (for my coffee). The foot is an exaggeration of course, but not the rest. The size of the table was literally not large enough for our drinks and two meals.  As small as the portions were, they befittingly came in normal, human-sized dishes, leading to our questioning of having water glasses on the table at all.  Maybe we don't need water?  Bottega Louie, one Ravioli and no space for water.  Oh, and the server was a douche.

Loud as hell. I couldn't hear 98% of what my girlfriends were saying, and yes, we were all at the same table. I love their food, but good god, it's a horrible place to catch up with friends. The high ceilings are gorgeous, but not conducive to noise level. Portobello fries- delish but overpriced for how much you get. Pizzas are bomb. Pastas are underwhelming. Macarons YUMMMM! Place was crowded up the wazoo and it was Thursday night.

Dined here on a Saturday evening with in a group of 8 friends.  We were prepping our bellies for a night of drinking so my boyfriend and I ended up ordering alot of food: Portobello fries, Margherita Pizza (Mozzarella, Grana parmesan, tomato sauce, basil & oregano), Pepperoni Pizza (Mozzarella, Grana parmesan, tomato sauce, oregano & pepperoni), Orecchiette (House made orecchiette, port Romano sausage, extra virgin olive oil, sautéed broccolini & rainbow chard chiffonade), and Macarons. Stand-out dish? Portobello fries! Battered, crispy outside + meaty, tender inside + creamy garlic aioli. Ok dishes? Margherita Pizza, Orecchiette, and Macarons. Pretty good, but nothing outstanding or memorable. Disappointing Dishes? Pepperoni Pizza. The pepperoni on the pizza was the cheap kind of pepperoni you'll find on Costco french bread pizzas and bagel bites. Definitely not the quality charcuterie you expect from a place like Bottega Louie.

What can I really say about Bottega Louie that 3,632 people before me haven't said already? Yes, Portobello Fries are amazing. Yes, macarons are cute and delicious. Yes, it is very white and NOISY. Yes, I will brave downtown traffic and one way streets to come back because dining at Bottega Louie makes me feel cool. Oh and the other funny part about our brunch here is that we were asked to fill out a survey in exchange for a gift certificate. My friend said yes, not realizing that this was a huge ass survey with a million questions asking things like your income and how far did you come and where else did you consider going. Weirdness.

Italian cuisine with French desserts. :) The only cons in this restaurant is that it gets pretty noisy so it's hard to hear each other. Otherwise, the ambiance is very classy. The restrooms are nice and clean. There are fresh flowers displayed. They close late which is pretty cool so you can hang out here after work hours. Great customer service too! The Protobello Fries & Aioli is too die for!!!!! I've also tried the Margherita Pizza, Eggs Benedict, Greek Yogurt, and other desserts before. They were also good! And I LOVE their macarons! Almost the same as Ladurée's. I like the packaging and presentation. Would definitely bring my friends here. :)

So far I've only been here twice, but the out of town guests I've brought here all really enjoyed themselves. Despite it being super packed, we poked around the retail end and was seated fairly quickly. We ordered the Margharita Pizza, Kobe Burger, Lobster Hash, and four macroons to share between the three of us. The food was great - a little on the salty side, but the ingredients were fresh and not too oily. I still this it's a little on the pricey side of what you get, but I will come again. Service this time was good - last time seemed a little cocky, not just busy. It is VERY noisy here though - you'd be hard pressed to hear yourself. Parking is meh, but I never expect otherwise in LA.

This review will probably be the longest I'll ever write for Yelp, at least I hope! I suppose it's due to how strongly I feel about this place haha. I was here for the first time on my birthday dinner, Monday night, and zomg!  So much people!  T'was busy like a Friday night!  I came with a party of 7 (they don't take reservations btw), and we were just waiting on 1 other person.  We tried telling the hosts that the other was just parking. They still would not let us sit at our table because the "whole" party wasn't present. The host said he'd call his manager to ask if we can be seated, since it was AGAINST their policy to seat people who weren't all there. I kinda took this as a threat. Unbelievable.   When it comes to the food, regrettably, it fails to live up to the hype. We ordered many dishes, pizzas (like the Burrata), pastas, soups, salads.  Being a yelper, I had to taste test everyone's dish at least a tad bit; I used my b'day status to this advantage hehe. And I thought my food was the only one that tasted unexceptional.  Wow. The Burrata was overpowered by bitterness! Due to the kale leaves I believe. I mean I love healthy ingredients, but I've tried kale before in its raw form, and I'm sure it didn't taste as bitter as it does here. I tried my boyfriend's spicy pasta, this onion soup that "wasn't" French Onion soup by name lol. The arugula salad was slightly better than the other eats. Certainly healthy & tasteful. The portobello fries gave me a weird aftertaste IF I didn't eat them dipped in its sauce. It was all just ok, bland even! This made me so sad and disappointed, being that I went with the general consensus on Yelp---to try this so-called great place out.  I mean I should've known.  People were complaining about the noise level, and how this place was really a "hit-or-miss."  Sigh....So all of my friends didn't enjoy their food except for one, 'cuz she loved her salmon! But that's all. Yeah it was crazy loud, I couldn't hear my friends across the table; we had to yell and wave to get each other's attention.   Unfortunately, I missed out on trying their "famous" macarons. They're made of almond flour (as are most macarons). I'm allergic to almonds =(  But I bought 8 macarons in this cute pink box, for $18!!  So is it worth every penny?!?  My fam thought they were good, not amazingly good.  Oh & I had the chocolate souffle for dessert, now that was righteously decadent.  I just thought it was funny how our waitress stood aloof as my friends sang happy birthday, just so afterwards she can lavishly pour the vanilla sauce into the souffle LOL. She really took her time on that one. Mind you, the waiters don't sing at all! I expected something like at Buca di Beppo, where they would do a happy dance! But of course you can barely hear anything else in the huge dining room. Plus the prices.  Too expensive & totally unreasonable for such average to below average food.  I guess on really busy days, they can't keep up with the food quality/consistency. The service was also bad. She misunderstood my order. Our waitress seemed overwhelmed by the amount of people she had to tend to, which I don't blame her for, I mean how could you see/hear everyone in the dim light & noisy surroundings?!   All I know is, don't go here for first dates! It definitely isn't intimate to be here. This place nonetheless, is most definitely over-hyped.  They put on this facade to make you think, it looks like a fantastic place to eat---so they must have the yummiest Italian/French food there is in downtown! How/why do people love this place I don't think I'll ever get. There are plenty of other better French & Italian restaurants out there!   Then again, only PROS to going here, and it has nothing to do with the taste of food: -the ambiance and interior design; detailing of the restaurant is gorgeous (high ceilings---BUT that's what affects the acoustics of the place) -Their macarons are pretty, so are their dessert platings & dessert boxes So if you wanna go for looks, then come on down to this eatery!

I LOVE the decor of this place.  Tall ceilings, large windows, romantic lighting, and the chefs in the open for you to marvel at as they toss their dough super high. A group of about 10 of us got seating at a large round table right by the pizza oven, which was fine because that's where the best lighting was.  If we had sat in any other corner of the place, we might have felt like we were sitting in the dark.  Anyway, our server was very helpful, knowing the menu, and asking us what our preferences were so that she could help us choose our dinner options.   I could eat those mushroom friends FOREVER. I somehow was expecting french fries with some sort of mushroom twist to it, but they were legitly large mushrooms cut into steak-fry-sized slices, fried up and served with heaven's own garlic sauce.  This had to be my favorite of the time. We should have listened to her when she said we should order 4 Modena salads.  Considering none of us were in a... green mood, we only ordered two.  Only problem was that the salad was more like 5 rather large pieces of butter lettuce with crumbly cheese and candied walnuts.  Don't get me wrong, it was a very delicious salad, but definitely something that should be shared between 2 or three people per plate, and not 5 like we tried to do.   The Orecchiette pasta was definitely my favorite pasta here: slightly spicy, marinara sauce, with noodles that remind me just a little bit of RBC's (kill me, I'm a nerd). The broccoli complimented the dish well. We ordered a total of 3 pasta dishes, and the only one that really stood out to me was the Orecchiette. Our group tried four different pizzas: sausage, mushroom, proscuitto, and another one I forgot the name of that I really liked (it had kale in it, that's all I remember).  The pizza was made in the flat style, but cut into pretty large pieces, so everyone had about 2 pieces, with some pasta, salad, and bread as well.  I remember the Proscuitto pizza tasting quite good, with some cream keeping the proscuitto from completely falling off as you bite into the pizza, and added a nice flavor.  Sausage was a little too salty for me, but then again, I'm not much of a load-your-meat-onto-any-dish-in-any-quantity type of person, so I'm sure all the meat lovers out there will like it.  The mushroom was good, but it didn't seem to have much mushroom on it, I wished there was more to it. Finally, even though we were stuffed, we headed over to the desserts, because who can leave Bottega Louie without at least 3 boxes of macaroons? I tried every single flavor---call me a fattie-- but they were all good, except I didn't really like the Rose one.  I'd have to say my favorites were the vanilla, red/chocolate, and coffee-flavored. Lemon had a nice kick to it too. Overall, great decor, good food, great dessert, great service. I'd definitely come here for a date or even a nice catchup dinner with a friend or friends.

Came here only to pick up some baked goodies, haven't actually dined at the restaurant.  Bottega Louie has a great beautiful selection of sweets greeting you as you walk in.  The macaron display is impressive, with a beautiful and colorful array of flavors.  Buying macarons individually is $2, or you can buy them in boxes of 5, 13, or 26 for $10, $26, and $52 respectively.   We got a 13-count box, which was devoured very quickly.  Bottega Louie's macarons have a nice slight crisp on its outer shell, and a wonderful soft chew on the inside.  Just the right amount of filling, not too much.  They have an awesome variety of flavors too!  I tried earl grey, black currant, rose, pistachio, salted caramel, green tea, raspberry, lemon, and dark chocolate. I very much enjoyed these macarons! So how do they compare to others' macarons?  I waaaaay prefer Bottega Louie's macarons to Paulette's, as I personally find Paulette's to be too soft and over-filled.  Bottega Louie had a lot more interesting flavors than Bouchon offers, and of course they are smaller in size than Bouchon's.  I slightly like Bouchon's a bit more, but these give them some very stiff competition! TLDR: Bouchon then Bottega Louie then Phillipe then 'Lette

A friend invited me to lunch here.  What a wonderful experience.  Great food and menu and special baked good treats and candy make it a great place to stop in.  Very Chicago-esque in the heart of the subpar Downtown LA area.  Expect to pay $8 for parking at a local private lot.  I enjoyed French Onion soup and a Bianco pizza.  Loved the fresh brewed iced tea served with lemon and orange slices and liquid sugar! Recommend.

My personal review as a customer of the Bottega Louie restaurant is that it's got a great menu and casual/trendy atmosphere. It's Menu for lunch, dinner, and dessert has a large variety to choose from. It's hours of operation accommodate my needs when I have clients in town for a group business lunch or dinner. It also has accommodating parking for my business groups when we come in. The waiting staff they have are very accommodating and quick as well. Bottega Louie restaurant also has free Wi-fi which assists me on having my business lunches or dinners with clients when we need to get on the internet. I also like coming for the full accommodating bar they have at the restaurant in which helps me have a place to take out clients after business hours with it's drink specials and large variety of cocktails to pick from makes the restaurant a one place shop for lunch, dinner, and/or just some cocktails from the bar. Some of my clients are wheel chair bound and need a place to go that is Wheelchair Accessible. The Bottega Louie restaurant has it setup Wheelchair Accessible for people who are wheel chair bound in which makes it a great and comfortable place to go.

Inspired decision to have breakfast here before boarding a noon flight back to NYC. Frise lardon was delicious, but the dressing could have used a little more bite and the first poached egg refused to run into my greens, swiftly replaced by attentive waiter. Roasted potatoes were crispy and creamy all at once with carmelized onions and roasted peppers. Latte was serviceable, expected more and lame art.........not even a classic tulip............but ohhhhh the pastry and bakery cases........calling to me in multicolored rainbowed hues were the amazing macrons..........pistachio, cappucino, lavender and salt caramel were on point!....Homemade marshmallows made a nice surprise for my wife.

The restaurant is beautiful and classic.  From the minute you walk in past the dessert cases you are transformed to another place.  The restaurant was filled to capacity when we dined and the dining area was buzzing with conversation.  As a party of two, we lucked out and were seated immediately.  Fortunately avoiding a long wait. The portabello mushroom fries are a must!  They are so delicious combined with the garlic aioli..yum!  We ate the torpedo and club sandwiches, kind of what you expect but somehow the ambiance makes even a sandwich feel special. I would love to go back for an early breakfast or late night meal.  The noise level was  a bit much during the lunch rush but not enough to deter me from going back again.

This place is too damn crowded and too damn loud! *shakes fist* But if you forget the noise and snag a table (after a long wait) the food is quite tasty and surprisingly filling. Also, I'm a big fan of the Maitre'D which was Nate Tao. Check him out on Youtube people. It's also cool how they don't take names for the wait list and just profile you instead. Very interesting indeed. Ordered a pizza and some tomato bread thing I forgot the name too and some meatballs. I heard I should have gotten the portobello fries. The food I did order was excellent though and designed very well. I did not like the sparkly water though and the loud noise of the cafeteria like restaurant was more powerful than anything I've known. Overall the price wasn't too bad considering the trendiness of the place, though you'll have to spend some bucks on parking and probably macaroons as they're very colorful and desirable. I'm not a big macaroon fan though so it didn't lure me in. The service is very good and that enhances the experience. I showed up a little late to closing one time and got a free macaroon from a funny employee who told me he'd kill me if I told anyone. How could I not be a fan?

For the chocolate souffle alone, I would give it a 5 star.  It takes ~25 minutes to prepare so you would be doing yourself a favor to order it early.  It was well worth the wait.  As for the entrees, I've had better elsewhere.   For the service, 1~2 stars.  Our server was hard to find and didn't check on us too much.  We had a party of 10, and 20% tip was automatically added to our bill.  Perhaps that's the reason for the mediocre service.  Oh and there was an extra line on our bill that says "Tax of the 20% gratuity".  Hmm.. We already tipped 20% of the tax, and then had to pay tax again on the tip.  Let's circle around and dance some more, shall we?

*****Bottega Louie's MOP (Meal in One Pic)*** http://www.yelp.com/biz_… ************************************************ Impressive, Enormous, Obnoxious, Overpopulated, Outrageous, Delicious. From the beautiful bake goods (macarons, financiers, saint honore) to the mouth watering baguettes, and special breads. From the nougats, the chocolate truffles, to the freshly made pastas and pizzas. The food is Impressive, the place is Enormous, the large book and the line is Obnoxious, the space is Overpopulated, the pastries are Outrageously Delicious. Butter lettuce, and goat cheese http://www.yelp.com/user… Simple. Nice butter lettuce topped with roasted pecans, and a good goat cheese. The dressing was good ( ordered on the side) . Real simple. Good ingredients , good taste. PIzza - Pepperoni and artichokes mozzarella http://www.yelp.com/user… A great pizza because of the freshness of the ingredients. No cans have been open to make it, no plastic bags have been tossed out of the freezer. The color of the veggies are vibrant, form the red of the tomato sauce to the green of the basil. The mozzarella is creamy and tasty. The pepperoni spicy and crunchy. A delightful pizza. The macarons http://www.yelp.com/user… They taste great. They are as good as the macarons at Gordon Ramsay's at the London Hotel. The texture is perfect. They are fresh and not frozen ( compared to most places in LA serving thawed macarons). Are they as good as Laduree? Of course not. The salted caramel is far from the Laduree's one. But for LA they are awesome.

I miss it when it wasn't as crowded. Never had a wait for a table at lunch and barley ever had to wait for a table at dinner (10 minutes at the most). Now the wait is and 1 hour or more. Since the ceilings are so high and it doesn't absorb any sound, it gets so loud that I practically have yell for my friends to hear me. The food is very good... Portobella mushrooms  fries and the shrimp scampi are my favorite. The shrimp is huge, like a mini lobster and the sauce is perfectly creamy. The pizza is pretty good as well depending on what you like. I have to ay the pork chops are not good though...very disappointed. Very bland and dry (had it 3 years ago so might have changed). Some of my favorite pastas aren't on the menu anymore but hopefully it will come back. Love the chocolate souffle, but order it 20 minutes in advance. Been to brunch on sundays which was ok.

Ode to LA Hype Oh Bottega Louie you sure are pretty Your ceilings are sky high, though your prices are a little better Entree portions are decent-sized even if the macarons are bitty It's more a place to see and be seen, if you're a trend setter Portobello mushroom fries - wth? GREASY Entrees are pretty good, nothing to write to mom about Come once to try - and again only if out of town friends are visiting I came because I thought the food would be as good as the location, naively Those macarons though, I'd eat them by the handful, easy!

Walking in to this vast space and seeing beautiful cupcakes and macaroons in a colorful display is enticing.  NOTE TO SELF:  Macaroons to take home... Big, vast and loud but it all works.  TIP - no corkage on your first bottle of wine.  We arrived at 3:30 in the afternoon and this place was hopping!  Oh, and we did have a great bottle of wine..... We started with the Portabella fries - WOW - you have to try these.  Cheese pizza is next with mushrooms - more of a white type pizza and it was delicious - great crust, simple and really good.  We followed that with a Skirt Steak with fresh veggies - they were FRESH - excellent veggies, and Truffle sauce.   You have to have macaroons for dessert, we ordered 4 or five, they were out of one and the waitress brought us 2 alternatives.  My FAVORITE was the salted Carmel. Service was fantastic, no corkage on your first bottle of wine, very good food!

There's something about atmosphere that really gets me when it comes to restaurants, or businesses in general I suppose. Bottega Louie is one of those places that really sticks out in my brain - not because it is mind-blowing (though their bakery is pretty good), but because it is so stark white, loud and energetic. But I'll cut the shit. It's Downtown LA. Everything's going to be overpriced, as is evident from having to pay $5 just to park for 5 minutes. But man, those macarons really are worth it. There's about 13-15 flavor variations in multiple colors, with seasonal flavors. For 13, you'll be paying around $25 but don't worry, you'll get a cute box with a bow in a clear bag so everyone will know what you just bought and where. Can't hate, though. I love me some simple but expensive goods. However, I can get annoyed with the attitude behind the register*. Hell no, I'm not tipping your snark! *Take with a grain of salt, as there are some genuinely nice people that work amongst the others!

A spectacular and delicious 5 stars! There is a reason why this place has over 3,000 Yelp reviews, and why the average waiting time is about an hour. This place is legit and it seems that  the Yelp community agrees. The ambiance is a touch of high class elegance, but not too overwhelming. From the outside, the restaurant emanates a romantic and quiet countenance, but on the inside it is a loud party where people are throwing elbows to get in (ok not that dramatic). Onto the Food. The menu focuses on quality rather than quantity. The menu is filled with sundry items from interesting pizzas and lasagnas to mouth-watering salads. The Modena salad is fantastic. The candied walnuts and balsamic vinaigrette provide a great one-two punch. After the salad, I also ordered the Bianco Pizza, which I split with a friend. The pizza was simple, yet delicious. Flat bread dough, a little bit of sauce and cheese, and topped with arugula. It was plain, elegant and sophisticated. Imagine the Apple brand, but for Pizza.   I've only had a small dose of what this place has to offer, and I'm excited to see more. The place also boasts a nice bar and a bakery filled with all sorts of out of this world pastries. I came here around 2:30 PM on a Saturday afternoon and we were seated within minutes. I recommend coming around this time, as the place gets packed. What an amazing gem in the downtown area! My only regret is that I did not hit this place sooner, and that it took about 3000 Yelp reviews for it to finally hit my radar. Thanks BL!

A little piece of European heaven in Downtown L.A. Went there for a nice lunch with my man during the holidays and loved it. Great classic big-city decor that brought to mind a bright, Parisian cafe. A beautiful (and crowded) counter with all sorts of sweets and baked good one can order to take out and an elegant dining area, full bar, and open kitchen all brightly lit by tall windows, great for people watching on the downtown streets. My man is a huge fan of the turkey club, which is huge and amazing as far as clubs go. I hada few bites and highly recommend it. I had the meatball sliders, which looked like a wee appetizer but filled me up nicely. They were different than anything I had seen before and absolutely delicious. The only slight con is the service, which is pleasant enough but on the slow side. Come in and relax when you have plenty of time and are in the mood for something tasty.

Oh, Bottega Louie. It's a beaming white building nestled in within the blocks and blocks of downtown grey. With it's high vaulted ceilings and gorgeously waxed floors, this place looks like a palace. They have an amazing bakery stocked with tons of easy-on-the-eyes cakes, macarons, and tarts, and their house brewed coffee is aromatic and delicious. Just be aware of their prices. Bottega Louie isn't a place to scrounge around your purse for a few rogue dollars. Bring a card or enough cash because just a few pastries will run you $20+. I've dined in before, and my experience was pretty enjoyable. The wait was excruciating though. The wait was long enough for me to browse the bakery 3 times, walk 6 blocks around DTLA, and I still came back to wait for another 15 minutes before being seated. I wasn't in much of a hurry, so the wait didn't bother me that much. I came for a Sunday brunch, and I ordered the smoked salmon benedict, french toast, and portobello fries. I loved everything, and it was all served hot and fresh. The portion sizes are pretty decent, and the waiters are lovely.

This is my first Yelp review! Thank you to my daughter for introducing me to Yelp and for teaching me how to use Yelp. I went to Bottega Louie on a Sunday with family. The location is downtown LA. There is a parking lot for $5.00 right next to the restaurant. The inside is stunning. There are beautifully decorated pastries everywhere. The colors and the presentation is simply beautiful . However, the cost for one of these pastries is so ridiculous. I saw a small cupcake for $12.00. I had a few macaroons and they were very good. But $2.00 for a very small "cookie" was a little pricey. I get that this is their gimmick and people are willing to pay the higher premium for the ambiance, but $2.00 for a small macaroon just seemed crazy to me. We waited for about 50 minutes. There was no place to sit so be prepared to stand. It is also extremely crowded. I felt like I was constantly in the way. Once we were seated I ordered a sandwich called the Torpedo. The presentation was beautiful. The problem was that the bread of the sandwich. It was very crispy, large sourdough bread. I could not bite through the bread without ripping my teeth out. The bread was also too crispy and hard to cut with a knife. I ended up eating just the meat and veggies from the sandwich. I was disappointed that my meal was totally inedible as a sandwich. My family members ordered pizza and breakfast. They said the food was ok. The service was also just ok. Overall, I think this is a great thing to do once. The building is beautiful and the pastries are beautiful. However, the food is just ok. The service is just ok. And the food and pastries are very expensive for very small portions. Thank you for reading my review.

I was having a craving for something sweet late last night and remembered that a friend had recommended the macaroons at this place so I figured I would give it a try.  Initially I was just going to pick up some macaroons and leave but I was with my buddy and he was hungry so we sat down in the dining area and had a full meal. The ambiance in the restaurant was sort of trendy but not the uncomfortable trendy that you run into occasionally in L.A.  It was more of a laid back trendy. We were seated promptly by the hostess  which was cool because I hear this place can get pretty crowded and have a long line and doesn't take reservations. I ordered the Chicken Parmesan and my buddy ordered the pepperoni pizza.  Both were good, albeit slightly over-priced but not so over-priced to the point where I felt like I wasted my money or wouldn't go back.  The service was a little bit slow but I wasn't in a rush so it wasn't that big of a deal. Before we walked into the restaurant I found $60 just laying on the sidewalk so I figured I'd use that to fund part of the dinner.  That ended up being the dessert portion of the dinner.  We ordered two of each macaroon on the menu (except the pistachio).  It came out to like $40 just for the macaroons but it was kind of free so whatever.  The best macaroon was by far the lemon with citrus buttercream.  It wasn't even close.  Next time I will just get that kind.  The other flavors weren't bad or anything but the lemon just put the rest of them to shame. I would recommend this place if it's a late night in the middle of the week (I went on a Wed. night) when it's not too crowded and there is plenty of street parking. Overall a solid place and would probably go again with a date or something like that.

What a chic place! The decor is so simple and refreshing. And the bakery side just looks like heaven to me! The colorful baked goodies all lined up perfectly waiting to be savored(: Mhmm, I would stay there all day long if I could. Okay! Let's start with the food (brunch)/ cafe side first. - Portobello mushroom fries were cold and oily. A little disgusting actually. - Eggs Benedict was mediocre. I had better at other brunch places. - Ravioli was good but not amazing. The sauce was nice. - Farmers Market Breakfast was also just mediocre. And for dessert, I got the beignets since I never had them. And also, since I thought getting them to-go would not do it justice.. if they were to serve it fresh and warm! I was a little disappointed that they were served room temperature! It was ok.. beignets were fluffy still. I do love the raspberry sauce that came with the beignets more than the beignets themselves tho. On the way out, I  got some desserts to-go of course! (Who can resist!?! ;D) So many choices! I spent a good 20 minutes before finalizing my order. I got the key lime tart, creme brulee tart, princess cake, tiramisu eclair, and the little pistachio cupcakes. The prices of the sweets were a little steep, but there's this magical atmosphere in this place that makes you want to indulge yourself and pour our your money. Lolol.. The desserts were as expected. Well made! I suggest trying any one of their tarts because they definitely do a good job in making a crunchy flaky tart shell! =) Princess cake was a good one too but a little on the pricier end. It is a half macaroon shell base with either milk/ dark chocolate mousse/ ganache on top!

Really, you cant carry non grocery store coffee. For the billion dollars you charge for all your gross pastries you couldnt keep the high end coffee and take less of a profit on one item. The coffee has been soooo bad I literally wouldnt drink it for free. Sadly even starbucks serves a better coffee. wtf dudes. But I love my gays there :)

You will see the colors of macaroons walking in the door, but there are also tons of other sweets to choose from. Gold gilded everything. It was just a beautiful restaurant. I was in awe. Came on a Saturday at noon, and it was fully packed, but got seated within 10-15 mins. Ordered Salmon Benedict and Portobello Fries. Both were delicious, but I could not get over the fries. They were actual stakes of Portobello mushrooms in a seasoned batter topped with cheese and accompanied with a garlic-y sauce. Waiting for our order, we also pizzas being made by the oven. Everything looked so fresh. I also got some macaroons to go. They were $2 each, and comes in so many flavors. My favorite(s) are: matcha, rose, vanilla, and salty caramel. But all of them are tasty. Fresh with a light crust and soft as you bite in. This have definitely became my favorite brunch/lunch spot.

Didn't expect to enjoy the food here as much as I did. Started with the meatballs and portabella fries and shared 2 pizzas. The burrata pizza was my fav. I also took some macarons to go which I've stopped by and picked up before. Perfect size I think and much better than bouchon. Will definitely be back here to try more things.

I have been here twice and the second time was not nearly as great as the first. I was so immersed in the hype surrounding this place the first time that I overlooked some of the very things that tick me off about restaurants, most importantly, the quality of food, amount of food, and the price. The decor of this restaurant is quite nice with an open kitchen, bar, high ceilings, and dimmer lighting. It would be quite romantic if it wasn't for the LOUD noise level. Be prepared to pay $$ for tiny portions of food, and more $$ for the portobello fries which I thought was not too bad. I enjoyed the Trenne pasta the first time and I opted to order it again.  The sauteed pasta meshed well with the sauce, and although there was pretty much no prime rib eye (I expected more as stated in the menu), the taste was quite flavorful.  Though most patrons order their famous pork chop, our waiter persuasively convinced us to try the hanger steak.  Boy was that a mistake! My girlfriend asked for medium rare, and the end product was a well done, chewy, rubbery, slab of meat.   This faux-gourmet restaurant does, however, have awesome macarons! Upon entering, you will notice a nice colorful array of these sweet treats. They are a must try after your meal, and there are about 18 different flavors to choose from. Several points of warning: this place gets PACKED after 6pm, weekday or weekend, and they don't take reservations so either arrive early or be prepared to wait. The only parking available is either metered spots on the street or private lots around the area.

My review would be purely on their macaroons since thats the only thing that I got. I came in on a saturday night right before closing to pick up some delicious little treats. Since it was before closing, they probably didn't have all their flavors available. Even though the place was about the close, the place was still packed with people dining. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… I got... Matcha Salted Caramel Coffee Rose Earl Grey http://www.yelp.com/biz_… I wasn't overly impressed by these like I thought I would be! If anything I would prefer lette over BL. Why? well I don't know how you like your macaroons but I like them to be light and not feel like i'm biting into a soggy sugar filled pastry which I got a slight feel with BL. I would probably give this place another shot just to be sure that I didn't get a old batch or anything. I mean c'mon! BL is like one of the most famous macarons place in LA.

This place is great. The cavernous European bistro vibe is at once pretentious and completely welcoming. The food has been excellent every time I have been. It has the perfect mix of food to splurge on (short ribs amazing) and also pizza's that are large and split between two people for an affordable meal. This creates an atmosphere comfortable for all types of people which I much prefer to some stuffy overpriced place. Last time I was there, I think David Spade was having dinner, a table full of gangster type dudes, a table of crazy club girls dressed in super tight short dresses, next to a very uptight looking jcrew couple. It's people out for a good meal. Cons - You will wait for a table. You may wait an hour. I have never waited more than 30 min. It is very very loud. If you are reading this you are probably thinking wow everyone says this place is loud? It can't be that loud? These people must have hearing problems? It's a sort of audible level that is extraordinary. It is piercing. But it is also what makes the giant place feel private. So many people around you who don't really give a shit about what you are doing and who you are. That's what is so great about a crowd right? Not to say it's bad people watching. It's great people watching. Whatever. Love it, hate it. I'm going back. My parents even loved it. And they are not LA parents. They are suburban NJ parents.

This place certainly doesn't need another review but.... why not add my 2 cents to the the thousands of others! It's a gorgeous restaurant that makes you feel like you're in New York or London. The atmosphere is great if you're into crowds and noise. Be aware: You will strain your voice having a meal here! The 4 stars are mostly for ambience. The food is good but not mind-blowing. I always have a great time here!

This place is nice to impress a date. I get the impression that this place was created by a chef. Make emphasis on the kitchen, clear view of them working. A clean look to the place, white walls with few hints of color. Very loud though, so expect to nestle close to your hunny just to hear each other.  Food was okay, I did enjoy the pizza. Especially being able to watch it being flipped in the air at the back of the restaurant. I believe if the food can match the service and the decor, its a winner everytime. Big kudos to our waiter Ben!!

Bottega Louie is one of the hottest spots in town, it can be tough to get in, as it's very popular. I just came here this week again, I have been to this restaurant at least 8 times now, both for lunch and dinner and always an A+. The food is some of the best anywhere including San Francisco and NYC- and I travel for a living. The prices are very fair for the portions and quality and they also use fresh, local ingredients to create their dishes ::THUMBSUP::The pizza and salads are amazing, my favorite is the eggplant parmesan and the portobello fries! The eggplant parm is so delicate and delicious and the fries are awesome! And killer great desserts as well. The deserts and bakery are second to none in LA, oh and Offfffffff COURSE the macaroons-better, more inventive and fresher than any I have ever eaten in Paris. Service is very attentive and welcoming too. The place can be a bit loud ( far from too loud - just fun ) the crowd is business people at lunch and beautiful hip people dressed to kill for dinner. Close to 7th St, Metro. Downtown LA is once again the happening place to be and be seen. Come for the food, but stay for the French macarons!! Life sucks without macaroons! ESP the ones at Bottega! ;) A bientot!!!

Ok, so I haven't finished my review. I was only allowed to write 5,000 characters. Anyway, so this is not an update, but a continuation of my review. We got to the desserts. I love desserts and I try the Tiramisu everywhere I go. We also ordered the Panna Cotta and the Beignets. Here's the verdict. The Tiramisu was the most disappointing "thing" during the whole evening. It may have looked good with its checkered top (I didn't think so), but it surely had nothing to do with Tiramisu. It wasn't a Tiramisu. I was SHOCKED!!!! How could a place like this not have the BEST Tiramisu in town? It was an ordinary cake of some sort that didn't really have anything a Tiramisu should have (mascarpone, lady fingers, coffee, etc). It was terrible. Didn't taste anything like a Tiramisu. It was hard to believe that this place served something so ridiculous as Tiramisu. It was so bad that had the service not been so good, they really would only get 2 stars. The Panna Cotta was OK, but nothing to write home about. The Beignets were good, just like they would taste back in Europe. I liked them, although I think it's really not easy to screw up Beignets. I wished they had more Dessert Wines available by the glass, but a couple of them are so expensive that they can't keep them open for too long, should no one else order another glass. At the same time, I doubt that a lot of tables order a full bottle of dessert wines (I don't think it's easy to agree on one selection when there are a bunch of people ordering different desserts), so I think they should have a few more less expensive dessert wine selections available by the glass. Not a biggie, but we totally would have ordered the Moscato or the Ice Wine (my partner loves them both), but we didn't want to drink a whole bottle. We even would have paid $20-$30 a glass, but it wasn't available. So, I wasn't happy at all. Luckily, on our way out, Ben at the confectionery / bakery area (as we were looking at some of the chocolates and macarons) made our day. He was very friendly and pleasant and cute, but most of all a good salesman. He started talking to us about all the different chocolate truffles and asked questions what we like in chocolate. He was so nice that we ended up buying a box of mixed chocolate truffles from him. He earned the 3rd star back for this place from me for that night. I kept looking at the their menu and decided that I would give them another chance, since there are a few other things I want to try. No matter how much I don't want to go back there due to the noise level and the inferior, but expensive food, I promise to give them another chance to redeem themselves. I will write another review about that experience, as well.

Very trendy, popular and busy restaurant- for good reason! There was a slight wait but it was definitely worth it. The portobello fries, modena salad and porchetta pork sandwich were all very delicious and fresh. The acoustics are bad (it's very loud) but it makes for a somewhat exciting dining experience. If you have a sweet tooth, try the fresh French macarons- salted mocha and passion fruit were my favorite flavors. If I'm in the downtown LA area, I will definitely return and try the other entrees and order more dessert. The bakery display is a treat for the eyes. I highly recommend Bottega Louie for a meal or dessert, or both.

OMG.. i love my freinds  i didn't get to personally go to louie myself, but my freind brough me back macarons from this place!!! SOOO EFFING DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!! He got me the green tea, pistachio and raspberry (this one was my favorite, cause it had the chocolate filling inside which paired with the raspberry macaron so nicely).  I'm not sure how much each macaron costs, but all i know is the size of the macaron was enough for two -three bites; not just one gulp.  The macaron was flaky, soft, and chewy all in one.  The filling was also very delicious.  You could tell which macaron was which by flavor which was a plus for me, because a lot of the times.. they all taste the same!   Definitely must try out this place the next time in in the LA area.  Macarons you sold me ;)

A little bit of Paris in the middle of LA! This sweet spot has that touch of nightlife, cocktails and class that is a total reflection of city life. I went here after a night out with one of my good friends. We sipped on cocktails at the bar while being surrounded by a ton of people. What's great about BL is the open kitchen where you can see the food being prepared and the architecture...the whole building is garnished with intricate details. We put our name on the list for dinner and got called up in about 20 minutes, the hostess came up to me and grabbed me by name...nice. =) For dinner I wanted the arangini - Italian fried rice balls with marinara and cheese sauce. It was delicious and filling, like a little snack before my sweet treat! The bread was warm and fresh but what I was really after was the macarons! I had the Earl Grey, Green Tea Matcha, Orange Chocolate, Rose, two Raspberrys (since they were out of Fleur de sel...boo!). I think my favorite was the Earl Grey, and Orange Chocolate. They also serve San Pellegrino water as their house water, so I asked for fresh oranges and crushed it into my water for a bubbly sweet orange water. Perfect for my last night out in the City of Angels... thanks LA for 6 stressful but wonderful, scary but exciting, and truly adventurous years!

Still a fan, but not happy with the recent price increases. Every pizza used to be $14, but almost overnight they shamelessly raised the prices to $20 per pie. I realize Bernanke is working on QE 173 and the dollar doesn't go as far as it used to, but a 42% increase on your most popular item is a bit egregious. I am going to have to limit this place to business meals only.

I was in the downtown LA area this past weekend, so my boyfriend and I decided to swing by for a late night dinner. It was already 9:15PM when we arrived, and this place was packed! We had to wait for about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, I bought myself a box of 13 macarons, $2 a piece (they were amazingly delicious!). It was my splurge of the day! I really like how while you're waiting, you can either go to the bar, bakery, or simply look at the chefs busy at work. The restaurant was huge, with high ceilings, yet, the decor was simply elegant. The prices were decent, I had their burratta pizza and my boyfriend had their pan fried pasta with slow cooked beef in it. However, I didn't really like the service. When we went to the front of the dining area, the receptionists were kind of rude. They had three, and none of them would even acknowledge us (probably because they thought we were under-dressed). When we were seated, our server was rarely around, until it was time for the check. I'll come back for the bakery, but not the restaurant.

Alright; suckers and posers; winners with TigerBlood, and losers with "L" firmly planted with a thumb and finger on the forehead, listen up.  If you come here, you will find yourself outclassed, because here is a place that demands the following:   1. Cut that stupid beard   2. Put a nice shirt on   3. Find someone special   4. Take a shower   5. Expect something genuinely wonderful   6. Do the above, not in this order.   It's a very remarkable place, vaulted ceilings, energy in the air; a kitchen that is visable to all, and really, food that is genuine tasty.   It's a place that Gordon Ramsey would sit, inspect, eat, cry, be a man, and say, "well done, cheers."  Their menu is a single page. Easy to read, show casing the Italian food they put on your plate.  Here's what you should try.         1. Portabella Fries - It doesn't look like much, but you should put these in your mouth and let your friends know, they should also eat these. Napkins required.  It's not messy, but you will shed tears     2. Peperoni Pizza - It's a thin crust, well tossed pizza.  It's tossed, because you can head over to the huge brick/stone oven and watch them toss those crusts over 20 ft.     3. SHORT RIBS - YES ALL CAPS.  IT'S THAT GOOD.  You will find a piece of meat, so tender; you can discard the knife, and use it as a napkin holder.  The meat is cook in way that I rarely ever can claim, a fork is enough. The polenta you get is white corn, creamy and luscious.       4. BEIGNETS - Four house made beignets served with raspberry dipping sauce... you would be silly stupid, to not try these.  Sure you can go to New Orleans, and get some there, full of regrets.  Why, because the ones you find here, are heavenly good.   There are no tears for fears here, or some other ridiculous, just amazing food that is affordable; and just makes you warm inside.  The place is perfect for a night out, dates, special evenings, a girls night out, a guy's night out, girls "whatever" evenings... look if you have a girl, or guy, take them here, get there early, or you can stand around for up to an hour, but that is pretty much worth it too.   Take a moment to eat something here, and as Alton Brown says about patience, "you will be rewarded."

Bottega Louie reminds me of Sex and the City. Doesn't it?!  Fancy and busy with waiters that will grind your pepper and grate your cheese. :) On to the food, their Portabella Fries are AMAZING. Perfectly seasoned and cut thick enough for a wonderful texture. I don't remember what pizza we got, but it was also really good. Thin and chewy crust with fresh mozzarella cheese and mushrooms. It was really simple but probably the best pizza I've ever had. I'm so determined to try their desserts the next time I go. Mmmm, can't wait!

Here's a macaron review: My boyfriend told me a story about how his ice cream fell on the floor, so I made it up to him and gave him a colorful array of macarons.  The flavors were matcha (good), pistachio (good), raspberry (good, maybe, I didn't taste it), earl grey (a good tasting fruit loop one) and chocolate (not so great!).  The cookies were chewy and brownie like as they should be, and the fillings were not too much.  I'm hoping to give their chocolate another chance.  So many beautiful and delicious desserts there that I feel afraid to eat them!

BOURG-WA With a name like Bottega Louie, it already screams fancy schmancy. Factor in the elites customers and you have one hot power lunch spot. Bottega Louie is an Italian restaurant and marketplace that sells macarons, cakes, pastries, candies and on-the-go pre-packed sandwiches. On Saturday, 12.3.11, my friends and I came to Bottega Louie for lunch at 1:15 PM. There are no reservations and there was about a 30 minute wait for a table. F O O D *SMOKED SALMON BENEDICT: Poached Eggs, Smoked Salmon, Creme Fraiche, Red Onions, Sauteed Greens, Potato Pancake & Hollandaise Sauce ($18) - 3.5 STARS http://www.yelp.com/biz_… The potato pancakes were basically round hashbrowns. They were crispy and tender on the inside. The combo of the smoked salmon, perfectly poached eggs and creme friache created a salty, smoky, creamy and tangy decadence. It was good but not great. *HALF BURRATA w/ Grana Parmesan, Rapini, Garlic, Prosciutto & HALF CLAM w/ Pecorino Romano, Thyme, Garlic & Surf Clams Pizza ($18) - 2 STARS http://www.yelp.com/biz_… The pizza was very disappointing. It was very soggy especially in the center and too bready for my liking. The burrata pizza was too bitter from the rapini and it overpowered everything else on the pizza. The clam pizza was filled with tons of surf clams but one bite was more than enough for me as I couldn't get over the extra soggy crust. *PORTOBELLO FRIES ($10) - 4 STARS http://www.yelp.com/biz_… The best part of our meal, the battered and fried portobello mushrooms were extra crispy with a meaty tender center. The sprinkle of shredded parmigiano-reggiano added a pop of saltiness while the garlic aioli a creaminess. *MACARONS (Box of 13 - $26) - 3 STARS http://www.yelp.com/biz_… The macarons are available in 12 flavors: peppermint, earl grey, lemon, cassis, pistachio, matcha, espresso, manderin orange, grand cru, egg nog, raspberry, and vanilla. Dusted with gold flecks of powder and packed in a beautiful pink box with a bow, the macarons were pretty to look at but weren't very good. It lacked freshness. The cookies was too hard and lacked that cakey toothsome chew. The creamy center mirrored their said flavor but was too hard as well. S E R V I C E IMPECCABLE! Our waiter was extremely friendly, attentive, and quick. He constantly checked on us to make sure everything was ok without being overbearing. Considering it was a packed house, we got our food at a lightning speed; less than 10 minutes. A M B I A N C E / D E C O R Bottega Louie is a huge venue. Decor is minimalist with ivory walls and gold trimmings throughout. The highlight of the restaurant is the glass encased sweet goodies in the front. It's good for large groups but can get very loud. P A R K I N G Metered street parking ($4/hour). There's a parking lot in back for $5 for 2 hours. In short, the food was mediocre and reminded me of a bougie Cheesecake Factory. The service, however, was top-notch. Bottega Louie is a place where you can feel rich for the hour or two you're there. For me, a quick snap of the fingers brought me back to a reality of a Yelp addict who spends all her money in the name of Yelp.

Wow, 3600 reviews, and a solid  4 stars... why even bother writing one?   lol This place is awesome.   The food is very good.  Not great.  The pastas are lacking, and the pizzas could be better (although their crust is fantastic).   What makes this place so good is the stellar service, the design, the architecture inside (the wonderful use of negative space) the complimentary glass bottles of sparkling water and bread (now upon request), and the non pretentious patrons.   The desserts are off the chain too.  You'll know right when you walk in the door.     Very cool place.   It can be a little pricey depending on what you order.  average entree is about 16 bucks.   Lunch is great here, because the daylight shines through the giant windows and really illuminates the entire place.   But I haven't had any food here that was amazing.  It's just very good. tip when you enter, walk right up to the hostess stand (located in the center of the restaurant) and tell them your name and party info.  Louie does not make this obvious, and it can be confusing for a first timer.  If it's busy, it will seem chaotic and unorganized when you first walk in.  You will save a lot of time by heading to the host stand immediately and getting your name on the list.

Be prepared to WAIT... a long time... and I don't know why they have a reservation thing on here, because they don't take reservations. We waited an hour and a half for our table on a Saturday night. I wanted to come here SO BAD, because I heard so many great things about this place! But, the food was totally mediocre! I do have to say that the Portobello fries were pretty fantastic though. The service, once we actually got seated was good, and the cocktails were good too. But honestly, the fact that we had to wait so long really killed the whole experience. The food just wasn't worth the wait. At. All. The atmosphere is beautiful, although it is a bit loud. We got a nice window seat in the corner. Nice high ceilings... The desserts are pretty amazing. But again, the wait is redonkulous... Good luck!

So my hubby and I went here on a date night and our consensus was 3.5 stars.   I was really excited and had heard good things about it, so I was bummed that we had to give a lower review.  Since my man is born and raised in Italy/Europe he has a pretty high standard for Italian cooking and European cafes like this (just fyi) Here's the break down of pluses and minuses: + we were seated right away without a reservation on a busy night + the margherita pizza that we ordered as an app was fantastic!  Wonderful sauce and very nice dough + the prosciutto & seasonal fruit plate was very lovely - we split a cup of the pasta e fagioli soup.  And while it didn't completely bother me, it wasn't that great.  The broth was very watery and while the sausage was well seasoned the rest of the soup/broth was not. - my guy ordered the chicken parmesan (which I can't believe) but the breading came out soggy.  The chicken and sauce were fine but the breading is one of the most important parts of the dish and it was really mushy :( - the macaroons (which was one of the reasons we came downtown) we're not flavorful at all.  The best flavor was the Earl Grey- we also tried Pistachio, Rose & Peppermint.  The rose- which is usually my favorite- had almost no rose flavor at all, such a bummer. ** To be fair, the decor is fabulous and our server was very friendly, bussers attentive etc...  We will certainly be coming back and I hope to update my review with more stars.

The food is always exsquisite, but it loses points for just how loud it is and how crowded it gets.  The host staff definitely does try to make up for the shortcomings, but that's what holds this place back from being a GREAT date spot.

Before I visited Bottega Louie, I had built up a strange mental image of what I was getting myself into based on bits and pieces of information that I had casually brushed off in prior conversations. These talks would start something like my conversation partner saying, "Hey have you heard of Bottega Louie?", and my attention immediately going towards video games, tacos, my junk, my junk in somebody else's trunk, etc. See, the name is far too pretentious. Just the sound of it makes me cringe. "Bottega Louie". That doesn't even sound nice. It just sounds confusing and pompous. And lame. ... So all I had to work with were the words "macaroons", "busy", and "sort of expensive"... Three things I'm not the biggest fan of. But after finally trying it out, I'd have to say those three words pretty well describe the spot. First, the macaroons. Delicious. And this from a guy who doesn't like macaroons. I mean, come on, macaroons are just like, colorful, fat, gay Oreos from France. I'm pretty sure that's the literal translation. But, hey, color me gay, cause these were great. We had a few before dinner, a few during dinner, a few after, and a box to go. How exactly did we have so much time to eat so many macaroons? Yep, word number two: busy. Packed at the bar, packed at the seating area near the bar, and packed at every table in the actual "dining" area. That means plenty of time to go to the bakery counter and order macaroons again and again. That said, in the dining area they do a decent job of spreading the tables out so you don't have a stranger all smelling your macaroons and stuff. If you're expecting a quiet, romantic-ish (in a manly way) spot like I was, you'll be surprised. It's loud as all hell. It felt like I was in some kind of underground, macaroon-prohibition-era club. I wouldn't call that a good thing, but I guess that meant it wasn't as pretentious as expected. Finally, "kind of expensive". Ehh, not really, as I spend the same money on many other meals, but I feel like I'm just a little more satisfied at other places. If there's something very different about the food here, I'm not tasting it. Portions are mediocre as well. That means that, relative to what you're getting, yes, it is kind of expensive. Even for a baller like me who wipes himself with like twenty or thirty dollars sometimes. Still, without the wait, I'd gladly go back. I'd just really be in the mood for some macaroons.

3922 reviews?!?! Umm.. okay FINE.. I might as well get on the Bottga Louie review bandwagon as well! Ambience- Very lively and open restaurant. I love the simple modern white walls and interior, very basic but classy at the same time. Its trendy and almost high-end feel but not too stuffy where you wouldn't feel comfortable in wearing jeans or your chucks  to eat dinner. Bakery- Amazing bakery and market deli selection. The dessert is so pretty and you just want to buy everything behind the window. You have hot pink, blue, white, green, and blue assorted colors of either cookies, macarons, cakes, and more! I also love how they have already made sandwiches or pasta salads for those who want to just have a quick bite and not wait a long time for a table. Get the macarons, they are delish! Bar- Bar area is always busy and full of people. There are tiny tables available for those who are waiting for their table but want to get a drink while they wait. Food: Portobello Fries- If you are a mushroom fan like me, then you MUST GET THE PORTOBELLO FRIES. You will seriously be thinking about these fries for days because it is that good. I love the light batter around the portobello fries so you aren't eating all batter and no mushroom. The fries are cut thick and when you dip it into the creamy sauce, you seriously won't want to share the cup of fries with anyone in the table. TrenE Pasata- Pan sautéed trenne pasta with braised prime rib eye, Tuscan black kale & shaved Grana parmesan. Absolutely my favorite thing to get here!! Just picture what almost looks like a penne pasta and fried plus a side of sauteed kale and tender meat on the side. You have that crunchyness from the trenne pasta with the bitterness of the slight kale and then the savoryness of the tender meat. Absolutely delicious and you will not be disappointed if you order this! Pizza- Sausage, Mozzarella, Grana parmesan, tomato sauce, oregano & fennel sausage. Delicious pizza, not too thick or too thin. Comes pipping hot from the pizza oven. I would recommend you share this with a big group and order other items to share as well. *Tip- Didn't your mama tell you sharing is caring? If you are coming with a group or even with one person, I would recommend you get the portobello fries or some appetizer, a few entrees, and dessert to share. You won't be disappointed. That way you maximize your experience with the different dishes they have available.

Had a girls night out with some of my loves and my experience here was just as pleasant as the last. // AMBIANCE // Bottega Louie is part bakery (cue the beautiful macarons), part cafe/bar, and part restaurant. Sitting in the huge marble wonder at the corner of 7th and Grand, it reminds me why I love DTLA so much. With beautiful waiters/waitresses and sharply dressed urban hipsters, it's the perfect place to people watch. // SERVICE // Attentive and amazing. Having a better looking version of James Franco waiting on you doesn't hurt either. // FOOD //     +Portobello mushroom fries: As tasty as the last time I had it with the delish aioli dipping sauce     +Burrata with vine cherry tomatoes: the soft cheese was light and creamy     +Mushrooms with polenta: Good, but not Wicked Spoon truffle oil polenta good     +Portabello Fries: Better than the last time I had them and as usual, the dipping sauce was amazing.     + Fettucini with spinach, mozzarella, and tomatoes: Tasty, but not spectacular     +Mushroom Pizza: Delish with thick melty cheese.

This place is beyond fabulous. Now I understand why it is the most yelped restaurant in the United States. (This was confirmed by the staff.) I got there early on a Friday (which I highly recommend) because when I left, the wait was outrageous.  There is parking on the side in a parking lot, which is mostly for visitors of Bottega Louie. I would park there because it is difficult to find parking on the street. I had the shrimp scampi and the shrimp were so fresh and about as big as my hand.  I also had the pizza, which was delicious.  I decided to treat myself and had their special wine, which was slightly expensive (about $25/glass) but once you try it, you understand why it is so delicious. On the way out, I couldn't pass up looking at the dessert counter. I ordered a few macroons to go. They come in a variety of flavors and colors. They are OK - I am not a huge fan of macroons, but I had to try them. I am going to go back and try other desserts. Most of all, the staff is super knowledgable and friendly. They really know what goes into every dish and they go the extra mile to make suggestions. This was very refreshing and the recommendations were spot on.

Oh Louie! you made living in the financial district a lot less annoying. This place is hands down one of the best places to eat and enjoy where you are eating, if in the downtown La area. It looks all bougie and yuppy from the outside but the food is worth it. I definitely havent experimented with the entire menu but their pizza, salads and brunch are great places to start. ALWAYS SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT! not having dessert at Louie's is BLASPHEMY expect long waits. they dont take reservations =(

Bottega Louie. Since joining Yelp last year, I've heard so many great things about it. With 3000 reviews, there really isn't need for another, but I have to admit that after finally going here last week for dinner that it really is a great meal for the price. My friend and me shared a modena salad and a burrata pizza. The salad was marvelous. I loved the lettuce, nuts, and goat cheese with a perfect balsamic vinaigrette. For the pizza, I have to say it was good. Maybe not amazing. Just good. And good is good. The atmosphere is nice. The crowd was relaxed. Being downtown (except parking) is always fun these days. Bottega Louie. I'm a fan.

Those Portobello fries and macarons! I came here on a Thursday evening and boy was it crowded and loud! Yes, loud. Don't come here if you're expecting a nice quiet dinner. But definitely come here to enjoy the food like those Portobello Fries that were to die for! I also tried the Bianco pizza (Ricotta, mozzarella, Grana parmesan, roasted garlic & wild rocket arugula) which was delicious and crispy! For dessert we went to their bakery and had a TON of macarons. I had so many and loved them all. You can get them in a fancy box but something so pretty does have a price. So don't get the box unless you don't mind paying that extra fee. Parking here is pretty nuts. It's downtown! Parking the streets are free in the evening but it's not easy to find. Also, this place did have a wait! Come early in the evening unless you don't mind waiting!

I love the ambiance of Bottega Louie. It's exciting and fun! The chocolate soufflé was to die for. It's the best chocolate soufflé in California! The grilled octopus was delicious and tender, grilled and seasoned to perfection. The chocolate soufflé and the grilled octopus were my favorite dishes. We ordered 5 things: portobello fries, grilled octopus and hanger stake verdura wasn't cooked to my specification and was dry. I'm sure there are people who like fried food but I didn't like the portobello fries. It was too fatty. My friend and I thought that it was french fries with portobello mushrooms. Overall, I had a great experience. I took one star away because the waiter wasn't that great. He had an attitude and he rushed us in paying our bill so that he can go home.

Second time I've been here and both times I was impressed.  The level of pastry on display is very nice to see and out of the few items I've tasted, I've been pleased.  Never really had to wait longer than 10 minutes to get seated.  The service is good for a place this size and busy.  It's priced what you would expect a place of this size and in this location to be - for lunch, both times have been at $50 and we always add a petit gateaux or macarons.   This past trip I ordered a sandwich, and the portion size was huge.  The salads are well thought, fresh and delicious.  The pizza is really tasty too. Not really sure how you could be disappointed by anything going on here...

3 stars for dinner. The first time I went there, I thought everything was amazing. From the prosciutto pizza to the mushroom fries, to the salad.  The second time I went, I had the same things and didn't feel very impressed anymore. It didn't match up to other places I've had with shorter wait times.  So 3 stars for the food. And parking in downtown. 4 stars for the ambience.  The place is split up into 3 main areas. One for the bar and first come first serve seating (for food and drink as well). One for the dessert counter. And one for the general dining area.  Very sophisticated looking crowds and diverse walks of life.  The wait for a table in the dining area may take up to an hour, from my experience so hopefully come with good company.  They also have an open kitchen, which is fun to watch and observe the food being prepared. 5 stars for the desserts.  Macaroons! And also the fruit tarts are so heavenly.  My favorites for macaroons are the salted caramel, grand cru, lemon, and espresso.  Also appreciate the original flavors like matcha, pistachio, and rose.  My girlfriend and I tried two tarts- I tried the lime and she the passion fruit. I loved the lightness of the lime tart and afterwards felt like the passion fruit one was too sweet. But still both good. I hear the creme brûlée is amazing! I'd come here for drinks/dessert and for a classy place to relax, but won't do the wait for dinner.  I'd be back to try brunch sometime!

I really don't know why I waited so long to finally hit Bottega Louie up. I guess because it never really was in my area - but now I live in Echo Park and am starting to learn the downtown area for all it's splendor. Bottega Louie is definitely a delight. I went here with a pal of mine to have a gossip session and chow down like we always do. Except when we used to meet up we would go to somewhere crappy like Island's, and I was fat. Now we are grown up, lovely, and food connoisseurs of course. We have higher standards ;p When you walk in you're immediately bombarded by the bakery portion of the restaurant. They definitely want you to keep that bakery in the back of your mind as you eat - and it worked. The whole time we were at dinner we were smelling the delicious fumes of pastries and real whipped cream float across the air. The actual layout of the eating section is a little weird. And I say that because the hostess section is emerged smack dab in the center of all the tables. But we made out way over, and some snooty, well-dressed  and highly attractive hostesses got us seated quickly and with a sneer. It's all gravy though - our actual waitress was AMAZING. Being a hostess must suck. You have to stare at those pastries your whole shift knowing you can't eat any of them or you won't be able to squeeze into your size 0 pencil skirts...glad I don't have that dilemma. We were seated right against the wall - which is actually all glass. You're basically sitting in a display case for all of downtown to observe - and observe they do. Some people even stop and wave, which is fun and a little awkward at the same time. You do, however, also get the opportunity from the inside to people watch all the wackjobs walking by. Great for conversation. We had the sweetest, most gorgeous and highly accommodating waitress I've ever encountered. Management definitely knows how to pick em. She was very knowledgeable on the menu and made a great recommendation on a glass of wine when I asked. They also brought out some delicious looking bread and butter - which I graciously allowed my friend to chow down on because I was preparing to go to Hawaii. I ended up ordering the Onion Gratinee for starters, the Steak with Fries as my main dish, and a side of steamed Broccolini for good measure. Everything was delicious. The onion gratinee I believe was made with some type of merlot infusion - fantastic. Great balance of flavors. My steak was cooked to perfection, moist, and savory. I tried not to eat too many of the fries (Hawaii, stay focused). I did chomp on a few and they were super crispy and well seasoned. The broccolini was tender and on par. Upon conclusion of our meal, we definitely hit up the baked goods section and I got a sampler box of the macaroons - YUMMY. I also got a sampler box for my old boss, and some bon bons for a previous employer. Spread the love I say! Those macaroons were intense; so many flavors to choose from, and each so delicate and nummy-ummy. Such a fan! I didn't even dare hit up the rest of the pastry section, but I will definitely enjoy returning to taste their wide selection of creations.

The best way to describe my experience was weird, not in a bad way, just weird. The restaurant attracts such an eclectic audience and I couldn't pinpoint what population they are targeting. Looking around the restaurant didn't help as I saw rich old ladies, families, a group that looked like the cast of Jersey Shore, young couples, business men, hipsters, and of course the man in a velvet pimp suit lined with pink fuzz. The ambiance gave a very dream-like vibe, where everything is just a little quirky but you can't quite pinpoint why. It appears very clean with its high ceilings, large windows, and white walls and white uniforms for the waiters. I guess it is very representative of downtown LA. The bread was placed directly on the table, and was extremely hard, though I was extremely hungry so I didn't care too much. The food was alright, overpriced for what you get. I got a soup and salad and the lettuce was presented as whole leaves. I wasn't disappointed as it was still good, I was just confused as to why I had to cut my salad. The 3 others I was with seemed to enjoy their meals, no one complained but no one raved about it either. I think it's worth coming here just to experience the ambiance and grab a dessert from the case, but not to have a full meal.

Let's talk desserts! I finally got a chance to try their colorful French macarons!!! The pistachio was just okay. The nutty flavor wasn't very apparent and the ganache was definitely oversweetened, as well as overly thick. It almost reminded me of fondant, which is quite gross, in my opinion. Yuuuuck. But...the bright red salted caramel macaron is definitely really unique and the BEST caramel macaron I've ever had. You heard me. Even better than Paulette's (otherwise known as 'Lette) caramel. Louie's is just perfect because the sweetness of the caramel comes like a rush as soon as you bite into the wonderfully crispy cookie. Super delish! But other than the caramel, I still prefer 'Lette over this place for macarons. After all, they specialize in them AND they are cheaper over there. But Bottega is a close second! Also, I noticed they have caneles here!!! I couldn't believe my eyes! I will DEFINITELY be getting some of these the next time I'm here!

Awesome place to dine! This was the first nice dining my husband and I had when we landed in LA.  We saw this place as we were driving in the area and from the look of the restaurant..it was a must try! Once you walk in, the restaurant is huge! There is two open kitchen, once for the salad and cold section and the other seemed to be the pizza and grilling. We got the pizza, portabello mushroom, which was awesome and pork belly! Everything was delicious and the atmosphere made it very romantic. It is one of those restaurants that if you are in the LA area and looking for a nice dinner out, you have to try! Totally recommend it!

What a beautiful place.  Looks like a real Parisian bakery but grander and newer with nicer people.  I had breakfast and a green juice and it was very tasty.  I'm gluten free but there was still a lot to choose from for dessert.  I'm giving this place 4 stars only because I wish they made their packaged desserts without so many artificial colors.

My cousin explains Botegga Louie like this..."Its a Forever 21 with baked goods and some good food." So I walk in and it REALLY is that. We came in with reservations for a group of about 12 and they sat us right away. It was a little snug, but no biggie, they were realllly busy. Being that we came with a predominantly Indian crowd who's into great spices and big flavor, they were less than satisfied with their pasta dishes. I on the other hand, ordered together with Kristin and 2 others...We got the Burrata pizza and their Portobello fries. I think we got the better dishes of the table. The Burrata had some great garlic taste, topped off with the saltiness of the prosciutto. Pizza is definitely the way to go! But regardless of what you order, its a MUST to order the Portobello fries...deep fried and battered Portobello mushrooms! A few of us got drinks. If you can't find anything on the list that catches your eye, most of the waiters double as bartenders at other places, so go ahead and ask and they'll whip you up something REAL good. HAHA, don't ask me what I had or what anyone else had, but at least for the drinks no one had any complaints. I gotta come by for some goodies, didn't get any cus I was SOO FULL...not to mention some of the baked goods were a little pricey. Next time though.

The strawberry macaron was perfect! It has a nice thin crisp crust, chewy body and flavorful middle with bits of strawberries. Not too sweet either which is good.

This place is so over hyped! The food: we had the fried portobello mushrooms. What's the hype about this, seriously? Its just the portobello mushrooms wrapped with flours and friendly deeply in hot oil. It doesn't have any wooow effect on it. The dipping came with it is also average, it reminds me of the sour cream. That's it. Another starter we had is like donut buns(cant remember the exact name), its just donuts,with the jam dipping. It doesnt taste bad, but its just donuts. The taste like donuts, the texture like donuts, they look like donuts. So why do u want to pay $10+ for 3 tiny donuts that u can get from any donut store for $2??! The main, we had egg benedict and ahi tuna salad. They are a joke! They taste just like the average food you get from any average brunch place you can find in LA. The tuna actually tasted a bit funny, like not fresh and smelled funny. The only highlight will be the dessert. Macaroons are good, a bit too sweet. But still can't complain comparing to the rest of their dishes. Also the place gets extremely loud, its the loudness that you can't hear yourself without shouting. So better take someone you want to have an arguement with, because you can definitely release your anger freely in this place without feeling offending anyone. You know what, they should totally make this as one of their business models. Anger releasing brunch place! :P

What a surprise to find this nice big restaurant in downtown LA after a day in the Fabric / Garment district shopping. We were offered water either sparkling or regular at no charge, food was really reasonably priced -- really tasty and different. Dessert was so beautifully presented in the cases it was almost too pretty to eat, we bought three things and brought them back to our hotel the Hilton Checkers - a few blocks away. The restaurant was busy and noisy, but it was St. Patrick's day so to be expected. Dinner was so good that we went back in the morning for a few lovely baked goods and a sandwich for the rest of our day. It is rare to find a restaurant that gets it so right, good food, unpretentious waitstaff, and a really nice experience too. I just hope they open one of these fabulous restaurants in San Diego! I'll be back on my next buying trip to L.A.

This place runs like a very well oiled machine, there is seriously so much going on all the time! Bakery right in front taking care of all the sweets business. Long line of hungry foodies waiting to talk to the front desk hoping the wait isn't going to be too long. Nice open view of the kitchen, almost like a sneak peak of the magic that goes on inside. The hustling and bustling waiters/waitresses/bus-boys/and staff. And of course the families, friends, business associates that are here to enjoy the food. My friend and I shared: Smoked Salmon Benedict - poached eggs, smoked salmon, creme fraiche, red onions, sauteed greens on top of a potato pancake and smothered with hollandaise sauce. I loved the potato pancake alternative! All the ingredients were super fresh and presented beautifully. Half Buretta / Half Sausage Pizza - Burrata, parmesan, rapini, garlic, olive oil and prosciutto di Parma / Mozarella, parmesan, tomato sauce, oregano and pepperoni. The buretta was so delicious! Beignets and Macarons - Beignet was filled with a chocolate filling. Macaron was great. I loved the trendy atmosphere and just the busy-ness of this restaurant. Regardless of the crowd, the service was superb and very attentive. Such a great way to start of the day in LA.

I've been wanting to try this place for ages and I've finally did today thanks to the bf. I find it a bit weird where they have you sign in at, but whatever works for them (hint: look for the big book). We came here for brunch and it wasn't fully packed at 10 in the morning. However, as we were leaving around 11 there's a wait. Bf had the Smoked Salmon Benedict. I thought it was yummy, but felt it needed a little something (maybe a squeeze of lemon juice or chopped dill). Bf said it was good but the salmon wasn't needed cuz it just gave the saltiness. Lol. I had a half order of the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes with Blueberry Syrup. First thing I tasted was the lemon and how it was fluffy and not dense, but I couldn't taste the ricotta. A bit disappointed but the blueberry syrup made up for it. It's like maple syrup with a sweet-tart flavor of blueberries. Yum. I've been to BLD for their blueberry ricotta pancakes and I think it's a tie. If you want the ricotta go BLD but if you want lemon pancake with blueberry syrup, come here. To shared, I ordered the Prosciutto and Burrata. It was good, but with so much prosciutto, it was on the salty side. The potato cake on the bottom kind of helped cut the saltiness as well as the creamy burrata. Make sure you tear or cut the basil leaves on top, so you can have some on each bite to enhance the flavor. Table bread was cold but good. It had a nice crusty exterior with soft chewy interior. Macarons: Pistachio: I didn't taste much of the pistachio flavor, but I think that's because I had the salted caramel before it, which was sweeter. I need to try this again to double check *hint hint* Matcha: Yum. I can really taste the matcha. Lemon: This reminded me of eating a lemon cookie with cream filling but a macaron version. Raspberry: Yum. The filling is a chocolate ganache with raspberry jam in the middle of it Salted Caramel: My least favorite.  The caramel was kind of hard that made the whole macaron hard to eat. Overall: 4.5 stars

One scorching hot Sunday, I found myself in downtown LA Searching for a place to eat, and wanting a sweet little treat "Let's go to Bottega Louie!", says my dear friend Kristy So we parked around the corner, quite ready to order Our hungry bellies screaming, "please make the wait shorter!" Someone must've heard our cries, because we were soon chowing down portobello fries Couldn't believe they were made of fungi, so good and we didn't know why! Must have been their tender turgor, or the aioli that was filled with much flavor We then ate our margherita and artichoke pizza, good but not exceptional--just like Trevor Ariza I scan the room with my eyes, and find pretty girls in chic skirts and fine men in ties White walls, gold details, and chandeliers on the high ceiling -- a sophisticated vibe, yet a homey, comforting feeling The hot weather gave me quite a thirst, but our dracula look-alike waiter always filled my glass first Off to the famed macarons we went, wanting to spend every last cent Salted caramel, grand cru, and earl grey were all mine And strawberry and raspberry too! I just could not decline As we drive off into the Los Angeles abyss, a bite of these babies puts me in bliss Not quite like French traditional, but the flavors so good that I ate every last crumble To my dearest dracula, fungi fries and macaron babies, we shall meet again When my wallet replenishes itself...I just don't know when.

Dropped by with some friends to grab some macarons. They're pricier than your average at $2 a pop, but mighty tasty! I got one of each flavor, including earl grey, raspberry chocolate, lavender, expresso, and, being around Christmas time, egg nog. I wasn't a huge fan of the egg nog, but the rest were stellar. They were true to their flavors and not overly sweet. Crisp on the outside, chewy within. I brought them home to share with the family, instant win. Looks like I'll be heading out to buy some more :P They also come in a nice box if you buy a set. Otherwise, we didn't stick around to grab a meal, but the decor was pretty amazing. High ceilings with a very clean and classy finish. Probably would be a nice place to take a date if you don't mind a slightly noisier atmosphere.

I can't say anything else that hasn't already been said, but I'll say it anyway: THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! Every since dish that we had was absolutely delicious! Not to mention the space! Gorgeous! The macaroons will set you back a pretty penny, but they are delicious! The Earl Grey was my fav. That is all.

Bottega Louie's is a beautiful restaurant that is probably what the inside of my brain looks like....... marble counters covered in freshly baked breads, perfect tarts and tarlettes, cakes that are too pretty to eat, and a rainbow of macarons. Sigh. It is so pretty. I could probably stand around and take pictures for days. Anyways, though. Stopped by to pick up some sweet snacks to take up to the Griffith Conservatory. I got a fruit tart which was amazing and 5 macarons ($10). The fruit tart was so good, the crust was sturdy enough to just bite into it and the fruit were perfectly glazed and sweetened. I thought the macarons were good too - i chose rose, mandarin orange, early grey, espresso, and pistachio. The mandarin orange was my favorite. Beware when eating the macarons though that they do use a lot of food coloring or dye so your lips and tongue will turn the shade of the cookie!

I came here with my roll dawg M.F. today for a girls day out while running some errands in DTLA.  We decided to come here since we had both heard about Bottega, but never been as well as to try their raved about macaroons.   The overall decor and ambiance of this place was really chic, hip and classy.  The desserts looked so scrumptious I just wanted to take a bite of each.  We chose to sit in the dining area and got a seat next to the pizza area.  Taking a look at the menu, we decided to share the lasagna and fried calamari.  To drink, M.F. chose the green tea mojito whie I ordered a raspberry Italian soda.   Green tea mojito - refreshing, but a little too sour for my tastes.   Raspberry Italian soda - had a top layer of whipped cream, yummy yummy! Lasagna - the girl on the next table over was eating the lasagna and it looked pretty bombdiggity...first bite not too shabby.  Other reviews complain that it tastes like just mozzarella and ricotta, nothing else.  I have to disagree.  The meat ragu on the bottom was a perfect balance to the creamy ricotta.  I personally really enjoyed this dish. Calamari - it was cooked well, tender and not rubbery.  However I don't necessarily think I'd order this again just because it wasn't anything special.  I'd rather go to Yardhouse and order it during happy hour.   For dessert we ordered 4 macaroons to share; earl grey, peppermint, rose and matcha.  I liked the earl grey one best, but overall I could have done without these and ordered the creme brulee or something else instead.  Some might accuse me of heresy, but I actually prefer Paulette's macaroons over these.   This spot is definitely for those into the hipster scene, but it's not too pretentious IMO.  I plan on coming back in the future to try their pizza because they looked pretty tasty when watching them come out of the oven. A little pricey, but I'm not surprised... it was $47.85 for the entire meal between us two girls.  Ehh

I just happened to be driving on Grand in downtown as I drove by this place. It was so aesthetically appealing that I had to go in. As is typical for Grand St., there was no street parking as I went around the block but then realized they have a valet lot right next to the restaurant. I walked in and immediately felt like Samantha from Sex & the City (which is weird b/c I'm a total Charlotte). The hostess table is basically in the center of the space and splits the dining room from the bar, bakery, and open kitchen seating (the open kitchen was a great touch.) The massive interior space with the high ceilings is gorgeous. I don't know who designed the space but I'm a fan. At the bar, I helped myself to a beer while wifey tried the 'Moulin Rouge' - she loved it; She gave me a sip and I could see why she loved it. It was a $12 cocktail but that's par for the course and, really, it was delicious. We had the Portabello Fries [$10] (which were HIGHLY recommended by our server) which were quite good and very unique but I wouldn't order it again (but you should try it at least once). We also had the Lamb Porterhouse [$12] which served as a small appetizer and, with it's savory grilled char marks, was by far my favorite morsel of food that night. Unfortunately, each piece (it comes w/ 2 pieces) is quite small but I'd this is a 'Must Try!' For dinner, we had the Spaghetti Pomodoro [$14] and the Pork Chop [$20]. If you like spaghetti, this is a top notch dish. I, however, wouldn't order this because it seems like there's so many other dishes that would be better (like the steak). But this dish was prepared very well. Perfectly cooked pasta that was just shy of al dente and fresh tomato sauce which was very clean on the palate. Fresh. The Pork Chop was served applesauce and grilled apples and a mash or hasbrown of some sort (looked like a crab cake). It's a big, hearty dish....but I wasn't a fan. It wasn't bad, I just didn't like it. Next time, I'd order the steak. I recommend this restaurant if you're downtown if for no other reason then to at lest just experience the ambience one time. It looks completely upscale but it's actually a quite casual environment.....felt very LA only unpretentious. P.S. They have beautifully packaged desserts and pastries that will likely make you part with your hard earned dollars dollars.

The really downside about this place is the way they set up their logistics.. you have to wait a pretty long time and you can't "wait" until your whole party is there.. other than that the food itself is what gave this place 3 stars.. their macarons are pretty good.. but theyre not the best i've ever had.. just average. like the rate of this review.. for dinner there was a pretty big group of us so we were able to try a pretty fair range of menu items.. overall we ordered 3 different pastas, 2 different pizzas, chicken parmesan, and porkchops.  for the small plates we couldnt pass up portobello fries. so we got 2 orders of that lol.. the fries are good.. the chicken parmesan was the best dish on our whole table.. other than that the pizzas and pastas were average.. you can get better at a lot of different restaurants without dealing with the crowd, prices, and wait... would i go there again? yes.. is it the best food you'll ever eat? no..
