Accessibility (Parking / Wait Time) 0/1 Star: Street parking is hard to find.  Had to wait about an hour for a seat. _____ Service (Waiter / Cleanness / Ambiance) 0/1 Star:  The waiters are in such a rush.  If you are sitting in the front half of the restaurant or near the cash register where people order to-go, your meal will consist of people standing next to your table watching you eat wishing that you will finish faster so they can eat. _____ Taste (0=Not Edible / 1=Edible / 2=Good (average) / 3=Must Try!) 3/3 Stars: Chicken Wings #74 on the menu is why so many people flock to this location.  Yes they are a Must Try! It's a sticky and sweet wing.  I love sweets and this crispy and heavily glazed chicken wing is really good.  It can get to be a little too much if you plan to eat more than 1/2 an order by yourself.  It gets really sweet and your teeth start to feel slippery. _____ Overall Experience 3/5 Stars _____ Pictures Chicken Wings. #74: http://www.yelp.com/biz_… _____ Last Words I wouldn't want to wait for a table again.  If I'm craving their wings, I would just get a to-go order.

After hearing about these AMAZING wings for months I knew I had to try them once I got to SF. The restaurant has an inconspicuous storefront that doesn't reflect the amazingness that you will find inside. The wings are super crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The sauce is so delicious I don't think there are words that can describe it appropriately. You just need to try them. The reason why I didn't give this place 5 stars is primarily because the other menu items aren't anything special. The pork dumplings were okay, wrapper was a bit soggy and overcooked. The chow mein was decent but nothing special. The black bean noodles were pretty amazing -- probably the best of the non-chicken entrees. The fried rice was decent but a definite must-have for the meal since it's the best way to eat that the leftover chicken wing sauce. We got two plates of wings, chow mein, black bean noodles, dumplings, and fried rice for ~$20 a person. Not bad if you ask me! It is a VERY popular place so definitely try to come during the off-hours...otherwise you will definitely encounter a wait!

Apparently when you come here around 4pm its dead with no wait, so the next time you want to treat your friend out for picking up your wallet at the library - you know when to take them to san tung. Who knew that one of the best places for wings was going to be found in a Chinese restaurant.  While i was waiting for the waiter - I remembered that i eat here 2 years for a christmas party. i remember waiting outside for an hour just to get a table. I dont think we came particularly for the wings but for some good Chinese food. I really wanted to try the tea duck, but they didnt have any. We ordered the wings and seafood chow mein. Im still searching for the best chow mein in the city, but so far san tung has the best chow mein. Using a combination of calamari, mussels, shrimp and scallops makes this noodle good. The fact that i did not need to add any condiments meant it was good as is. Onto the wings... Let me say that asian style wings they all use the same type of sauce which is a sweat and savory taste sauce. I never seen any variations of the sauce whenever i order asian style wings at any restaurants that serves it. Without that said... I enjoyed the wings. Definitely one of the best wings out there, but i do not think that they are more far superior to the other. What i like: - The meat was cooked perfectly -The size of the wings were big and gives you about 10 per $9.50 serving What i didnt like -Since they are dry wings they were cooked before dipped in sauce and the skin was really heard. The sauce started to caramelize on the chicken but it harden pretty fast making it a effort to eat it. The hard parts would graze the top of my mouth. The candy like skin would then get stuck in my teeth. Only certain parts of the wing was really hard, but some of the other parts were fine. Overall its a tasty wing. I would recommend it to everyone. I would go back there, just when there is no wait.

Sf has so many amazing restaurants and I make sure to come visit often for food trips, with that I've heard so many great things about San Tung's dry chicken wings that Hubby and I just had to give it a try. Fortunately for us we walked right in for a late lunch and had no wait whatsoever. The service was quick and short but the employees were very nice. Dry Chicken Wings - Wow, these wings are fried to the perfect goodness and dressed with this amazing sauce. The portion is large, and the chicken wing itself is still super moist with that perfect crunch outside. Very inexpensive, we had a friend with us I only had a few pieces while hubby and our friend killed two orders. A must try ! Green Beans - It was pretty awesome that I could see a worker cleaning the green beans on the side at a table, so you know these babies are fresh. Sauteed with a lovely light nice and tons of garlic. Cooked with great texture still, a nice bite, but still tender with a caramely finish. Shrimp & Leek Dumpling - These were okay, not flavorful as I was expecting, but mixing vinegar, soy, & chili made this better. The leek flavoring was pretty absent though, still cooked tender but not something I would jump on ordering. Pork Dumplings - Once again a little absent and not as flavorful, this came out a little overcooked. The pork flavoring was light. A great place to try if you're into chicken wings then I would highly suggest this place. A lot of people have mentioned they do get extremely busy so be cautious, I went in the late afternoon a bit before they closed. Extremely affordable food and the portion is awesome, enjoy !

These 5 stars goes out to their famous dry-friend chicken wings. Some people say it's overrated, but I was definitely blown away. If I had the money and time I would make a trip to SF right now just to have some. I think they're a must try! Everything else was good, but not as amazing as their wings. When my friends and I went, we got lucky and only had to wait 10 minutes or so. The food came really quickly too!

When I recently set up a bank account, half the time I spent with my new banker was him raving about San Tung and that I need to check it out. On his recommendation, we got the famous "Dry Fry" chicken. Perfectly fried chicken wings in a sweetish gingery-peppery sauce. Really good! Also went for the combination fried rice with beef, chicken, shrimp, and calamari. Very solid. Most of the negatives seem to be about waiting for a table. Seeing as we don't really eat out too often and prefer takeout anyhow, this place fits great :-)

DEEP FRIED CHICKEN WINGS, how often do I find myself cursing the fact that I don't live closer to you. I have no idea what kind of black magic they use to keep their chicken so crispy on the outside, covered in that delicious, sticky sauce, and yet so moist and  tender on the inside. Get the black bean noodles and the dry fried green beans to go with your chicken wings. There is usually a bit of a wait on the weekends. You will find yourself drooling over other people's plates and then order too much chicken for one person. Don't be surprised that you'll finish the plate AND be tempted to order another one to-go.

I might get hate mail for this....but I really only dig the dry chicken wings here. My buddy mark turned me onto this place after golfing some ten years ago....and it was crazy busy back then. I have had the cherry pork and it was okay. Shrimp and leek dumplings is okay...with so many dumpling houses popping up...there are many more places to get better. Most of the dishes are solid(three star)....but the dry chicken wings are like crack....it is what put this place on the map. So go and check it out....but definitely try the dry chicken wings

Came here on a Sunday at 11am right when they open. First one through the door. First one to order. Placed two orders of their deep fried boneless chicken and cold noodles to go. Told to come back in 25 minutes. Wait 25 minutes and ask where my food is. Ask to sit down. Wait 20 minutes. Get food. Pay. Leave. The food is good, but the wait is ridiculous. The tables that sat down when I ordered already finished eating. Probably lost my ticket. It would have been faster for me to sit down as if I was eating there, then just ask for my food to go when it arrives. I would have been out in 20 minutes.

I came here about 2 weeks ago on a Monday around 11:30am. There wasn't a wait so we were seated right away, but there we're not many open seating around. We had a baby stroller with us so they seated us in the very far right corner at a table that can seat at least 8 people. And it was only myself, my boyfriend, and our sleeping son. The whole reason for coming here was just to try the chicken wings because I've read and heard everyone rave about them. It took at least 10 mins after sitting down for someone to give us menus, another 25 for someone to take out drink and food order. Then another 30 to bring the food out. As we waited the line to get in grew bigger and bigger so we were glad we got there before the rush. We got our food and we started eating. Maybe 15 mins in they sat a couple at our big table. Can you say AWKWARD? They we're sitting directly in front of us and with all the food we ordered it kind of made us look like a fat asses. And since they had the thing in the middle of the table that turns we felt like we had to take our food off of it and set it on the actual table because it'd be weird if we were to spin it and our food end up next to them. I don't mind sharing tables next to each other like pho or how the middle of their restaurant is but not a big round circle table. It just made our experience a little weird. As for the food. It was great. We ended up ordering more wings to go so we can eat them for dinner later. We'll probably be back but will most def ask for a table where we can sit by ourselves.

3 stars from a vegetarian. I realize this place isn't well known or well-liked for their veggie options but their fare is better than what I expected. It was a few other things prevent this place from bumping up a notch. The good: the food is solid. Flavorful, well-sauced, and not bogged down with oil. As for their vegetarian options, they had excellent dumplings and we tried the spinach entree and the eggplant, which were both terrific. The bad: very little service here. But your expectations have to be in check - this is an Asian restaurant after all. They do a pretty good job of making sure you have water but aren't going to stop by and make sure everything is fine. They're way too busy for that. The tables for parties of 4 or less are basically right next to each other. Don't expect any privacy. This plus the lighting makes this a place to come with friends but not a romantic dinner date. The ugly: the wait. But if you're coming here you already knew that and were mentally prepared for the hour plus that you might wait on any weekend night. :)

I was literally shocked when I saw the wait outside this little restaurant.  I kept thinking there is no way that their chicken wings can be THAT good.  My sister decided that we weren't going to wait and went to get the chicken wings to go instead. As we waited about 20 minutes, my sister came out with a big bag of chicken wings.  It was freezing outside but we still stood at the corner of the street, digging into the yummy deliciousness of San Tung's Chicken Wings.   They were absolutely delicious, piping hot and full of flavor.  We were licking our fingers and eating up all the meat off the bones.  Definitely the BEST Asian Chicken Wings that I've ever had.   It's totally worth it for the wait if you want to dine inside or if you get impatient, just order it to go and eat curb style.  No one's going to judge you.  They will be jealous that you're eating such yummy wings and not getting some of their own!

Chinese food is not something that I regularly go to when I want to eat out, but the chicken wings... oh my, the dry friend chicken wings are out of this world. They are also the reason why you will likely be waiting over 30 minutes for a table (especially mid-day on a weekend). The wings were crispy and were loaded with flavor, a nice sweet and spicy mixture. Each order is close to 10 dollars, but you get a lot on each plate and is meant to be shared with others. But everything else? Not bad, but not great either. Ordered the kung pao, sizzling rice soup, mu shu, dumplings, and pot stickers, but nothing stood out. Service was painfully slow as it took quite a while to get our food. Overall, come for the wings. That's about it.

There is a long line. There are tons of people who will not give up their place. The food is worth the weight. Our first night here, we were blessed with a blackout after waiting 40 mins. We stuck around another 40 mins hoping the lights and power would come back.... and it never did. Foodies were eating in the dark as the smoke from the kitchen started to fill the dining area. Finally gave in and left to eat at some half ass'd place somewhere around the corner. Heart was sad Came back next morning at 11am. Same weekend, they had some crazy marathon and it was jammed packed. Inside were gorillas, disco dancers, robots and superheros. Was faced with another 45 min wait but once my wife, son and I got seated, all was great. Then our dry chicken wings came out. Damn this shit is badass... no one makes it like this... crispy, semi sweet, spicy and 100% delicious. We ordered a few other dishes, which were delicious as well but those wings.... FAB FYI, if you want to save yourself the crazy wait times, the store next door, the gelato place also makes the same wings. I guess the son owns this joint and they shared the same kitchen.... but something about eating Chinese/Korean food in a crazy fast paced environment makes the food tastes all the better.... I shall return for you!

To all the leftists out there, fear not.  Leave the white guilt at the door and take comfort knowing you can freely use "oriental" without judgment here. Korean?  Chinese?  IT doesn't matter *people's eyebrow.*  They'll respond to both. Try all or any variation of their original fried chicken wings (dry/wet/winged/diced).  An   absolute must (menu #74 aka their signature dish).  Potentially the best chicken wing, ever.  Not just among the asian chicken wing genus but in all of wingdom.  It is unfathomable.  Perfectly seasoned and glazed.  No need to cool off before eating.  Just the right amount of meat in each wing. Bottom line: If God ordered wings, he would call San Tung.  Rumor has it Pelican Bay and San Quentin have a direct line. Waits on weekend can be 1-2 hours long but other menu items are not worth the wait.  If the wait is the case, call them and order 36 wings to-go and eat someplace else, doesn't matter where.  Street parking is near impossible. Also, after you write your name on the wait list make sure you camp INSIDE.  Host will call your name once and if you don't respond within 3 seconds he will erase it.  Oftentimes, he won't even open the door to yell to those waiting outside.  I had no problem with him since I waited inside. They also have black bean noodles (jajang myung) and jampong (spicy seafood noodle soup).  Both bland.  The jampong broth is basically tepid tap water with a dusting of chili flakes. Their deep or wok fried pork dumplings were superb (menu #4).

San Tung is one of the best Chinese restaurants I've dined at. This restaurant is definitely worth the wait unless I was starving and needed food right away. The wait on a weekday evening for dinner around 8 is definitely not that bad. We were seated within 15 minutes for a party of 4. The service is okay. Some of the servers are pretty attentive with refilling our water and tea. My recommendations: - Original Dry Fried Chicken Wings: Very peppery and fried. - Pork Dumplings - Potstickers - Beef with Snow Peas - Noodles with Peanut Sauce: a bit spicy but I really loved the taste of the peanut sauce. The food is so great here. I look forward to trying more dishes in the future.

How good can fried chicken be? San Tung Good. I finally tried this place after hearing the hype and I was pleasantly surprised with how yummy it is. It's a little expensive for chicken wings and the wait can be ridiculous but I still wouldn't mind coming here again. The complementary kim-chi is super spicy! Since we had 4 people, they said we couldn't just order 2 dishes or else they would charge us for the kim-chi.... so we had the dry rub, wet rub, and pork dumplings. Most people seem to prefer the dry one but my bf and I thought the wet ones had more flavor. Pork dumplings were also pretty good. Well San Tung, good job--I'm impressed!

Dayummmmm the wait is long. Two hours for our first time for dinner saturday night. We got there at 6:30 and didn't eat until 8:30...but it was WORTH IT. Bring a jacket during the winter, you'll have to wait outdoors. The jja jjang myun (black bean noodles) were amaze. so was the tangsooyook (fried pork in sweet sauce) and of course the DRY chicken wings. It has a slight 5-spice flavor that is mind-blowing. Unfortunately, I live in LA, and 3 hours into the drive back down I got a hankering for those wings and drums. Le sigh. If you want to get just the chicken, their little boba shop next door sells them without the long lines...but I say just wait it out and it'll be the best meal of your life.

Chicken wings, and string beans - The two best things on the menu. The service is fast, and the food is excellent. If you live nearby, its worth it to do takeout because the wait can get super long. Also, they serve the wings in the store next door, so if you're just looking for a quick fix you don't have to wait for the main restaurant.

I never understood why people ask if something on the menu is good. What's the waiter going to say? The chicken penne is terrible, we keep it on the menu just to mess with you. Don't be that woman next to me who asked what's good here. Obviously if you've never done any research you shouldn't be eating here. The surly response she got was everything's good here, what do you want? Surly... but what do you expect? Every dish here is well done, honed by thousands and thousands of chicken wings drenched in that white pepper honey sauce. Big dumplings, green beans, etc etc. Basically just put a chopstick down on the menu and order that. You'll be happy at this comfort Chinese place. It's no high end restaurant but if I need a place to sit down and just be happy happy... this is it Jack. (or go next door for less wait).

I heard all the great things about the chicken wings and had to try it out.  We had a wait that started at 630 and lasted 2 hours.  The wait was completely worth it. We grabbed the typical korean-chinese items as well such as chajangmyun and champong with our meal.  They were both insanely good although the portion size was smaller than most restaurants serving the same fare.  The tangsooyook (fried pork with sweet sauce) was delicious.  The only ordinary item was the green beans but they were still awesome. The chicken wings are amazing.  The waiter recommended we get the dry wings rather than the wet as they were tastier according to him.  I have to say those were the most amazing chicken wings I have ever tasted and by themselves would have been worth the wait. I believe the little snack shop next door sells the wings as well but I would recommend waiting to try out all of their items for a complete korean-chinese food experience.

My favorite Chinese food restaurant, but one of my least favorite lines. Can be long wait but I think it's well worth it.  My favorite dish is dry fried flounder, but everything else I've had is good too.  Some of the waiters are pretty funny too. I can't figure out why yelpers give bad reviews because of long lines. That means the restaurant is doing a good job.  Anyway, just have a good time while you're waiting and it's all okay.

met up with some friends for dinner. Finding this place is pretty easy, and if you're here for dinner after 6....free street parking! The lines can get a bit crazy so i'd recommend coming early. There is no fancy decoration in this place, it's bland but the one thing that threw me off was where we were seated. Right in front of the entrance. Since there were people waiting to be seated, we noticed people were constantly staring at our food as we ate, a bit uncomfortable , and the door is a few feet away so you get nice gusts of cold air mixed with street odor. We ordered the dry fried chicken wings, mongolian beef, pork dumplings and string beans with a pot of rice. Service was extremely quick whenever we needed anything from water to napkins to extra chopsticks. Food was great! the mongolian beef was really tasty and so were the string beans. The dry fried wings were good, but if you wait too long the brown sugar makes the glaze thick like syrup, so eat it quick! Definitely will be returning, hopefully we get better seating though. (try to avoid the middle tables)

In an attempt not to sound redundant here, I'll share some of my favorite dishes since I eat here at least once a week.  Dry fried chicken wings - Eggplant - Cold Peanut Noodles - Veggie Chow Mein.  You do that, you'll be just fine.   And to avoid the lines just use the Postmates service and get your food delivered so you can eat in the comfort of your sofa with some stretchy pants on.

I made a list of places in SF to try in 2013, and San Tung was near the top of my list. I knew about the wait, but our group still decided to dilly dally and wait until 6pm to put our names down. We asked the waiter how long the wait would be for a table of four.......2 hours?!?!?!?!?!? THESE BETTER BE SOME DAMN GOOD CHICKEN WINGS AND GREEN BEANS....I am NOT one to wait for my food. Since I've been craving for awhile, I decided to suck up my impatience and just wait it out. 15 minutes in and 4 eavesdropped conversations later, I heard the waiter tell someone, "yea, the next door dessert (literally called....Next Door Sweets) place serves the same menu with less wait." SAY WHAT?? WHAT DID YOU SAY WAITER?? Withholding my excitement, I ran next door to ask the girl at the cash register. Lo and behold, SAME MENU, LESS WAIT. WHY WOULD ANYONE WAIT 2 HOURS??? Chicken wangs were good though! Since we skipped the long line, we ordered 2 portions of the chicken wings (for four people) to rub it in no one's face, dried fried green beans, one plate of potstickers (6), and black sauce noodles. Everything was so good, we ate til our bellies exploded. Worth the hype, but not the wait. If there's a long wait and you're super hungry, I would suggest just going next door and grabbing a table there. It's more quiet and intimate there anyway. Sorry if I gave away the divine secret to fast chicken wings...

The decent food here does not make up for the worst service I've ever experienced. I asked one of the waiters what the difference was between two types of noodles and this is how our conversation went. "What's the difference between number 6 and 7?" "What's THIS? *slams his finger down and points to the menu* "...shrimp." "And what's THIS?!" "...beef." He then pointed back and fourth to the two differing prices and left angrily..someone needs an attitude check.  I also believe they gave us the wrong chicken wings (we ordered the dry fried chicken but the ones we received were dripping with sauce) but seeing as how the waiter was so rude, we didn't want to deal with it anymore and just ate our mediocre chicken. This place isn't bad but for horrible service and decent food, I probably won't be back.

When one thinks of fried chicken, they usually think of southern fried chicken that establishments like KFC or Popeyes churn out.  Korean twice fried chicken has become more popular in more mainstream cities, but never have I heard of a Chinese restaurant praised for their fried chicken.  Ok, this restaurant is supposed to be Chinese/Korean since they serve food that can be interpreted as Korean and serve kimchee as a side dish if you eat in.  Both of their dried fried chicken wings and the boneless diced chicken are best described by KFC's old slogan from the 80s, it's finger licking good... I tried both of the dried fried chicken wings as well as the dried fried boneless diced chicken.  Both are tasty and crispy as they give the chicken (wings or boneless) a nice fry.  The sauce is almost like a honey bbq with sweet and slightly sour undertones.  I was surprised though that the sauces between the chicken wings and boneless diced chicken were a little different from each other.  The chicken wings had white pepper added to the sauce which gave it a slightly spicy pepper-ish undertones, which gave it a nice kick.  I am not sure if the differences in sauces were on purpose or perhaps the two dishes were prepared by different people.  I got my order to go, so I didn't get a chance to eat the food served right after it is prepared but can imagine how much more awesome the chicken would taste and may bump up the rating up to 5 stars! Until next time...

Still have not been for a sit-down meal at the restaurant. I only used their take out option on multiple occasions. Tasted ~10 items on their menu so far. Everything was very good. I would recommend picking up a hard copy of their menu in case you decide to call the order beforehand. The scanned version of the menu on the website is a bit challenging to read.

We thought we'd try this place one Tuesday night around 7:30 or so.  But the line was out the door, and the place was crazy loud.   We crossed the street, got seated immediately elsewhere, and ate in peace. We'll try it again if the line goes down.  Popular may mean good, but it's a chinese place in San Francisco.... not many of those around...

Let me tell you! The line is still going till the last minute they close! We got seated around 920 ish and they close at 930pm. It is crazy packed. I was very skeptical about a Chinese restaurant. We ordered the must order: the crispy chicken wings, black bean noodles, hot and sour soup, sautéed string beans, and mushu pork. I think my favorites were crispy chicken wings, hot and sour soup, and the mushu pork. The wings are what everyone raves about and really...I'm not going to start raving. I'm just going to say TRY IT! The hot and sour soup was excellent. Sour and white PEPPERY! Nice touch of ingredients inside. Plentiful amounts. The mushu pork was excellent. You roll it yourself...into a burrito. I thought its a great dish, light, flavorful with the egg, and the hoisin sauce adds a nice touch as flavor. Black bean noodles was not what I expected. I expected a strong black bean flavor but I was wrong. It was subtle. There wasn't much flavor though. One flavor through and through. I just felt like it was a bowl black glob. The noodles were thick and long. Difficult to get a portion because of the sticky sauce. It was alright. Not amazing. The sauteed string beans were good but overcooked for my taste. The skin of the vegetable was already wrinkly and peeling. Could have done without both but try for your liking. -Give it  a try! P.s. my mission is to replicate those wings! P.s.s. Put your name on the white board upon entering.

Add this place to your bucket list kids, you'll be so happy you did. This is officially my favorite fried wing spot. Ever. Their wings are just wonderful because of their unique taste. I've never had wings like this before, it's honestly indescribable. It will make all your taste buds come alive! It's truly sensational. I love that it's saucy and flavorful without being completely drenched in sauce. It allows the wings to be crunchy as well. There's a really great balance there. I can't believe it's taken me so long to try this place! It's about $10 for a generous order of wings, I'd say about 10 wings give or take? This is hands down the best place for fried chicken wings. Amazing!

Parking in this area sucks.. often you have drive around and wait.. and it is metered parking as well. Every time I've passed this place, it is super busy. But it wasn't until I read about the wings I decided to give it a try. About $12 gets you a good amount of wings... but the wings themselves were amazing! The fried chicken wings are crunchy and are covered in a thick soy/ginger/garlic sweet sauce... I have never tasted anything like it. Definitely one of those places I will trek back to for the wings.

First suggestion - make a reservation - I did and walked right in. The line was long and by the time we had left, longer. The food here is excellent, fresh tasting, delicious flavors, everything very distinctive. Four people ate heartily and loved it all.  That should say it all! Except - no desserts - desserts are to be found next door - and they were damn good too!

I now know why at least 75%, if not 90%, of the pictures for this restaurant are of the Original Dry Fried Chicken Wings (#74) -- they have a crispy skin coated in a garlic-infused, sweet and tangy honey sauce. Though the meat itself needs to be brined or marinated, the issue is moot when you dip it in the excess sauce. Their frying and honey sauce remind me of now-closed Kam's gourmet chicken from years back. Don't get me wrong but I wouldn't say San Tung makes THE BEST wings or the preparation style is THE ONLY WAY to go, because it's simply not. Getting over the hype and praise for what they're known for, I don't want to say that San Tung let me down as a Chinese restaurant because I only tried one other menu item: their Black Bean Sauce Noodles (#7). This dish is such a disappointment and not worth its high price. A few reasons for my grief: (1) The black bean sauce was very thick and disgusting from what must have been a lot of added cornstarch; (2) no actual black beans (unless it was grinded up); (3) noodles weren't cut to a manageable size and, with the thick sauce, made it difficult to pull out of the bowl in order to share; (4) didn't notice noodles were housemade given the smothering of the thick sauce; (4) very little beef and two pieces of overcooked shrimp and calamari each; and lastly (5) potatoes added as fillers (unless it's actually supposed to be there). San Tung stands at 3.5 stars for me at this moment, with their chicken wings receiving most of my favorable critique and I'll need to try their other items to get a better feel for what they can offer. On a side note, I noticed Skippy peanut butter jars being carted into the restaurant during the Saturday lunch hour...I wish I was blissfully ignorant of this.

Let's see what the hype is all about.. I told myself! Ordered: 1. Dry fried chicken wings- reminded me of Bonchon style but I liked it way better! Definitely lived up to the hype! 2. Hot & Sour Soup- delicious.. small size good for 2 3. Black Bean Noodles-  I thought this was going to be more salty due to the sauce being all over the noodles but it was actually lighter than I expected. Quick Service.  Be ready to order.  Came at around 3pm because I feared the wait from all the reviews I read.  Typical Chinese restaurant. Nothing too special or fancy. If I am ever in the area and there's no wait, I'll totally stop by!  But there's no way I would wait like 2 hours for a chinese restaurant. haha

Oh how I love the wings from San Tung.  It is actually becoming a problem. A friend showed me San Tung and I've gone back half a dozen times since. Everything I've seen going out to a table looks delectable and there is an extensive menu to choose from. Try the black sauce noodles, they are too good.  The noodles are thick, like an udon noodle, and the sauce adds a fantastic flavor.  According to the menu there are other items in the sauce (like meat), but I rarely notice it. Also a huge fan of the string beans.  I could honestly eat an entire portion in one sitting (that is somewhat healthy, right?). But the pièce de résistance are truly the dry wings. If you want to eat in the restaurant during peak hours, make sure you have some time to wait for a table.  This place gets slammed and there is often a long waitlist.  The interior is crowded, but not uncomfortably so.  The food comes out quickly as they are doing their best for a quick turnaround.

After hearing how amazing San Tung's chicken wings are, I was excited to finally get to try them! We ordered the pork dumplings, an order of the dry fried chicken wings, and rice (I'm Filipino; I eat everything with rice....and a spoon & fork). The pork dumplings were good and seasoned nicely, though they looked a little sad. I guess steamed dumplings really aren't that attractive, and you're looking for flavor anyway, right?! After seeing literally 10+ orders of chicken wings go by our table, we started to get more excited. Finally, a server set a plate down on our table, and I almost cheered with joy. First bite...mmm, crispy, spicy, and sweet. Nice texture for sure. After devouring the whole plate, my husband and I came to the conclusion that while they were good, they were a bit on the sweet side for us, especially when you get towards the bottom of the pile and one side of each wing is completely covered in the sticky sauce. I was a little disappointed because I was expecting a little more heat (and trust me, I'm a pansy when it comes to spicy stuff) to counterbalance the sweet. All in all, I'd come back! (Side note: I was fully expecting this to be a dingy, hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant. It's very clean inside!) A couple of tips: - When you get in, write your name on the white board (immediately to the right when you enter). - Wait too long? Go next door to Next Door Sweets; apparently the owner is a San Tung family member, so they serve the chicken wings and sauteed green beans (and a few other items). Plus their boba is pretty good AND they have a whole slew of interesting gelato flavors.

Boy.  I can't believe that I"m going to be the contrarian on this restaurant, but I don't get it the high rating at all. What's Good. --The wings are good.    Not the mecca of chicken wings, but good. --Steamed dumplings.  Pretty good.   Tasty, nice broth, pasta had just the right bite. What's Not So Great. --Long wait...  A long line to begin with to sit down, then a really r e a l l y slow kitchen.  15+ minutes between dishes...   --Shrimp and Tofu.  Really:  Frozen peas? (they were still frozen...)  Canned Mushrooms?  Frozen Overcooked Shrimp?  Bleech. FInal Thoughts... I thought that the food pretty Americanized which isn't necessarily bad... Sweet and Sour soup, Mu Shu Pork, chow mein, etc...   It's definitely not worth 2-3 hour investment.  If you're in the hood, and need a bunch of wings for the game, that's a different story.

Crappy service.  Long wait.  We went at 9pm so no excuses for the service to be below par!  We asked for just 1 additional round of the kimchi dish that they serve in the beginning TWICE and both waiters never got it for us!  It put me off in a worse mood than I was already with waiting for the line to end! http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Other than poor customer service, food is great, but not to a point where I would go back for it and wait in a loooooooooong line!   ATMOSPHERE - Average Chinese restaurant decor.  During peak hours, they ask if you want to share a table with another party.  You either join and feel awkward during the whole dining experience or wait another 15-30 minutes. FOOD - Of course, get their infamous fried chicken waangs that everyone raves about!!  They are indeed crispy, fresh out from the kitchen and sauced up with yummy goodness! http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Get their Black Bean Noodles with Pork (Ja ja mein)!  Mix the sauce on top and you will be slurping the noodles up like no tomorrow.  The next thing you'll know, it's gone! ; ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Their Seafood Fried Rice is pretty good!  It goes great with the sauce from the fried chicken wings! http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Final say - Poor customer service!

So really, what's the big deal about this place? We came in on several recommendations.  We get in, and no one even acknowledges us, even when we go up to them to ask about putting our name in.  Turns out someone was standing in front of the mini chalk board everyone is expected to put their name on, even though said guy standing there just wiped half the names off of it. We waited for about 20min.  I don't mind a long wait, and this wasn't bad at all.  What I do mind is that there are plenty of empty tables, more than enough to accommodate everyone waiting.  But nobody is bussing table, just hanging out, joking around. Ok, guy in charge of the little chalk board comes around and can barely read.  "Angela?"  "Did you mean Ashley?"  "Are you Angela?" "No, I'm Ashley, party of two."  "Is there an Angela?"  No, there's no Angela!  Get to the next names! Finally a clear table and we are seated.  We had heard someone at another table ask for (and I quote), "Two orders of wings, one dry, one wet."  That sounds great!  So our waiter comes up and asks for our order.   "Two orders of wings, one dry, one wet."   "What do you mean?"   "Don't you have two types of wings?"   "Yeah, but what do you mean?"   "Don't you have dry and wet wings?" "Yeah, but what do you mean?  That's what dry wings look like." At this point, I would like to call BS, since what he calls dry wings are dripping with a viscous sauce.  Fine, don't care, just give us ANY wings.  But we wanted to try both. "Are you sure you want the wet ones?  Most people like the dry wings?  Are you sure you want both?" "Uhh... no???" So after being talked out ordering their food, we got the food we were allowed to order.  "Dry" chicken wings, green beans, and rice.  The rice and green beans were fine.  The kimchi was excellent, went well with everything and on it own. But the chicken?  Did I miss something?  We didn't so much get chicken wings as a caramel apple, but instead of an apple it was chicken.  Way too sweet and difficult to eat.  The sauce was so thick, I tried to pick up a wing and the whole plate came with it. I've had some great wings that had balanced flavor and texture, but this place just doesn't have it.  Did I get a bad batch?  Possibly.  The good part is that they constantly make wings, so you get your food fairly quickly.  But with the poor service and wings that might be better if you just tone down the sauce, not a place I need to come back to.

I've been here 6 times and will continue to keep coming back. The dried fried chicken NEVER gets old. I've had it both ways, boneless and on the bone. I prefer it boneless. I suppose that's just a matter of preference though. I always try something new when I come back here as well. Everything, to be honest, has been delicious so far. This is one of my favorite spots in the city. It is a bit of a wait every single time, but I always walk away feeling like it's worth it! Definitely be prepared to wait, but I feel like the wait creates an anticipation that makes it taste that much better!

Dried or wet chicken wings, get it. The rest are mediocre Chinese food. Be prepared to wait between 30 minutes to 1 hour.  The service here is just as your regular Chinese restaurant... It's not the best, nor the worse. The Wings... It's flavorful, juicy, with a small hint of spiciness cooked to perfection for your savory taste buds.  It's one of the highlights in SF that you must try considering the fact that it has over 3000+ reviews.  If you don't get chicken wings here, then I don't know what you're here for. Oh yeah, I heard next door to the restaurant (some drink place) serves San Tung food as well.  You can order the food and dine in there if you don't want to wait that long at the san tung restaurant.

It was so good we went twice on our trip #embarrasing. 1st visit we only waited about 30 minutes. 2nd visit we were there right when they opened and literally when the clock hit 11:00am everyone started rushing to the door. it was HILARIOUS i couldnt stop laughing. INFAMOUS dry chicken wings: 5 stars! Dont need to explain anything to you. just order it. Ja jang myeon aka "black bean noodles": 4 stars! i usually dont like these and i actually liked it at san tungs. mu shu pork: 4 stars! this dish was ordered by accident but it was really good. basically sauteed pork with veggies and they give you wraps and hoision sauce to make little wraps with. leek dumplings: 3 stars! dont see why its a highlight. I only ordered it because it seemed popular but i could pass on these. save yo money!

Truthfully I've been seeing San Tung's wings all over my Instagram and my GF had mentioned that she wanted to try it out. I'm always hesitant about driving all the way out to this area because parking sucks and it's just really far down 19th usually. Also I'm not a huge fan of Chinese food but I'm glad we made the journey! B R I E F  S U M M A R Y -- Parking sucks but after 6pm you can park at the meters for free -- If all the tables are full, the staff will write your name on the dry eraser board -- Service was just OK, they don't check on you really -- Dry wings = sauced wings -- Wet wings = wings IN sauce -- Dry wings are flavorful and good -- Potstickers are good (but you have to make your own sauce) -- Dry fried beef is good & has same sauce as wings -- San Tung house shrimps has good flavor but they're not peeled? Not sure if you're supposed to eat the whole shrimp with its shell or not (don't recommend) - Dried sauteed stringbeans were a great side dish of veggies -- Family style food Well my GF and I got lucky because we only waited 5 minutes for a table on Saturday night around 8pm AND we got parking right across the street at a meter. I felt like it was a sign that we were supposed to come here. Originally I was dragging my feet because I didn't want to go all the way down 19th. The drive wasn't too bad, again surprisingly. The truth is the dry wings are exceptional. I'm not sure if I'd go out of my way to come here or if I'm ever going to crave them but they are very good. I wanted a bit more flavor so I started eating the dried peppers that were in the sauce. If you want a kick of spice, try it! I wanted to get a boneless chicken but it seemed like overkill since we got the wings. Thus I opted for the dried fried beef which tasted like a breaded chicken and it had the same sauce as the wings. I ate that with rice and was very happy. The string beans seem to be a trend for my girlfriend and I lately. There's nothing like a healthy serving of string beans to offset all the fat and crabs you're cramming into your mouth. Plus they have a bit of crunch. I was please with the potstickers because they were crispy on the outside yet chewy and also very hot! I made a good blend of vinegar and soy sauce to dip them in. I wish I had the potsticker sauce packets but I was suprised that the potstickers were so good. So many places mess up potstickers lol. Probably the weakest dish we had was the San Tung house shrimp. The flavor was great but the shrimp were served whole. I thought it wouldn't be a big deal and we would be able to peel the shell but the sauce was too sticky and everything just stuck to your fingers. We mostly ordered this dish to try some type of seafood that they offered. I wouldn't recommend this unless you want to eat the shell? I don't know just was a bit confusing. Service was uh... take your order, give you water, give you food and give you check. They're a very busy place as you can see by some people's reviews saying they waited 45 minutes. I personally wouldn't wait that long and am really glad it was a quick meal. We definitely ordered a lot of food for two and took a lot of food home but it was a pretty good experience overall. I'm not sure we'll have the same experience again but I would definitely recommend and will be back someday.

I'm not always a big fan of Chinese food. I think its too fried, too greasy or too bland. Our aunt and uncle took us here for the first time and I was actually pretty floored by how great it was. Bustling, 30 min-1 hour wait. Rushing waiters and a long menu to share family style. The sole reason our cousin insisted on coming was for their dry chicken wings which are glazed with some honey sauce. They were awesome. We shared sizzling rice soup, garlic chicken, mongolian beef, green beans. It was all flavorful and fresh. If you can get in early you should go! I'm a convert!

I've heard this name tossed around with the term fried chicken. After being officially signed up to live in SF (yay, signed the lease!), we walked around and decided on eating here. There was an awful, metallic, smell, coming from some construction right outside of this restaurant. We get into the restaurant, and the smell is gone. Phew. We get seated immediately, as we came in before the lunch rush. We were handed menus, a tea pot, and kimchi. I was a bit confused because I didn't know they served stuff other than chicken. Opening the menu, I was pleasantly surprised to find this to be one of those chinese-korean fusion places. We decided on garlic eggplant, dry fried chicken lunch special, and combination spicy soup noodles. After we ordered, (we talked to him in chinese), and he insisted that we get the a la carte order of chicken. Nobody ever orders the small order, and that we'd end up ordering another order anyway. lol, okay fine, we'll do it. So we upgraded. While waiting for our food, we ate the kimchi, which was pretty delicious. It was spicy, and flavourful, while still crunchy and crispy. It got to be a bit spicy for me... During our wait, the place slowly started filling up around 12 noon time. The eggplant came out first. It's very different than most places, but still good. Almost in a way reminded me of how some bitter melons are cooked (but this isn't bitter melon). Also, this was a green eggplant, not purple. Next, the chicken came out. It was crispy on the outside, and flavourful. It definitely lived up to its hype. Yum! we ended up finishing the whole plate of them! Finally, the noodle soup came out. I really enjoyed this dish. My korean friend mentioned it's one of the best ones he's ever eaten. The seafood was fresh, and the noodles were cooked perfectly. The soup was balanced nicely with spiciness, seafood, and broth flavour. I'd recommend this place! I don't think I'd wait more than 30-45 minutes for it though. Just come during the non-rush hour times and you're all good :)

Reservations for 6+ is a must. Call in 415-242-0828. Don't hesitate or you will regret it deeply. The wait is amazingly long and no one leaves the waiting pool. * Original Dry Fried Chicken Wings $9.50 Chicken wings deep fried in a batter with garlic, ginger, and roasted red peppers. (5 of 5) -  It is like how everyone raves about - A WOW. It is delicious. It is a bit messy, but the garlic, ginger, and roasted red peppers are still perfect. The wings are delicious and the sauce is intense but perfect with the wings. It is the top choice to order when eating at San Tung. * Original Dry Fried Chicken Diced $9.50 Chicken slices no bone deep fried in a batter with garlic, ginger, and roasted red peppers. (4.5 of 5)  - So it is the same cooking and batter and sauce as the wings, but because it is mostly white meat, it is not as delicious. And when it comes down to it, wings are delicious to eat. But for the rather timid or lazy, this is a wonderful secondary choice to the messy wings. But if you have enough people, you should order BOTH wings and diced. * Dry Black Bean Sauce Noodles $9.50 Shrimp, Calamari, and Scallops in a dry dark soybean sauce served over a bowl of fresh homemade noodles (4.5 of 5) - Delicious. But super messy and I always have to find some way to cut the noodles. They are so long and it doesn't come pre-tossed. So someone also has to toss the sauce and noodle together. But it is worth it. Just make sure you are not wearing white, there is always high chance the delicious and tasty black bean sauce will spatter on your shirt. But this is another top choice to order when eating at San Tung. * Braised Bean Curd $8.00 Fresh flash fried triangle tofu tossed with a nice mixture of vegetables in a garlicky sauce (3.5 of 5) - This is a good vegetarian dish. Because everything else tastes so much better, it is hard to rate this vegetable dish as high. Nothing special, but a good vegetable dish. * Dried Sauteed String Beans $8.00 Fresh Green Beans Flash Fried and Tossed in a garlicky Sauce with Chinese Pickle (4.5 of 5) - Another popular dish. Flash Fried Green Beans cooked perfectly. Taste like tossed tempura but without the batter. Delicious. The statement is be smart about eating here. Either make reservations for 6+ in advance OR consider TAKE OUT. This place has long wait and it is because the food is worth it. There are a lot of copy cats, but at the end, this place still reigns number one for Dry Fried Chicken Wings.

What a tasty place to eat ! I'm sure what I'm about to say hasn't gone unsaid yet for San Tung. It's chinese food :) and good chinese food at that. The wings , as previously stated, are very good, very close to a Bon-Chon style wing but better and not as heavily battered. We also tried the Mongolian Beef and a pork dish which was also tasty. Service is good, wait was a little long but the attendants were quick to bus the tables and keep everything moving along, would definitely come back when we're in town, just plan to come early than anticipated. And parking sucks, so plan for that as well :)

The best chicken wings I've had. Make sure you get the dried one. Also the black bean noodles. Enough said :) I suggest you come here half hour before they close so you don't have to wait awhile. Or take your chance and come at dinner time and wait about an hour. Mmm my mouth just got watery just thinking about them infamous chicken waaaangs.

IMO it depends on the chef who is preparing your food This time around I was not so pleased Wings: heavy handed on the white pepper but cooked well Shrimp in Lobster sauce: way over salted! Shrimp was rubbery Mushroom w/ Bok Choy: standard, nothing outstanding Pork w/ Green Onions: tender strips of pork seasoned moderately well. Would have preferred more intensity of flavor Overall thoughts On a good night, San Tung is top notch, on off days you will leave wondering what all the hype was about

Long wait but worth it!! maybe 45 mins but they keep the line moving and they utilize all the space they can. Chicken rings were sweet and fried 12 in an order and while I like bonchon more it was pretty good. They had sweet and sour beef (fried) with veggies which i really really liked since the sauce was over half of it so you can decide if you like it more dry or not. We had the green beans and the JJM noodles. Both huge portions and worth getting!

We came on Christmas Eve around 2:30pm, we waited about 30 minutes for a table for two. There were so many people we ended up sharing a 6 top with another couple. It was a little annoying that they kept shaking the table as they were talking, they probably didn't even notice. But on to the food: We didn't want to order too much as we were having dinner with family at 7pm. As I looked around at all the tables, I saw that everyone ordered the chicken wings! Of course we had to order that as well, and started off with the pork mu shu. Everything was delicious! I've never had pork mu shu before, you get wraps that you put the pork mu shu in and dip it in hoisin sauce.  The chicken wings came out very saucy. I love all things saucy, so needless to say, I enjoyed it very much. There's a slight crisp when you bite into it, and it has a sweet savory flavor. I felt like I was eating a candy chicken! I can see why everyone is so fond of these chicken wings, it's definitely a must try! A tip would be to come here around 3-4pm, that's when the rush ends and plenty of parking.

It's Christmas and they're open! Big thumbs up! My partner warned me that if I try their fried chicken, I would get hooked. Of course I was a big skeptic, c'mon now... Best fried chicken? Okay now I have high expectations. We ordered the leek and shrimp dumplings. It was really moist and tender. I liked it! But it couldn't take the spotlight of the next dish. The fried chicken. Took a bite of it and I'M HOOKED! It had a caramelized sugar glaze to it and was crisp to perfection. I couldn't get over the fact of the super tender white meat that was savory on the inside. Every single wing and thigh I ate I made sure to clean ALL of the meat off. It was so good, my partner and I had to take order an extra one to-go. Yes, and do believe we pretty much had to hold ourselves back from ordering 3 extra ones! The wait on Christmas was less than 10 minutes. That's fairly since we had to share a round table with another couple, but of course we didn't mind because that place was PACKED and we originally had 7 people ahead of us. On our way out, I couldn't help but notice EVERY single table had an order of fried chicken and black bean noodle. Well that surely means I'm going to have to come back and try their black bean noodles! With an extra order of fried chicken please!

Great food, decent price, but dreadful wait at dinner time. The length of the queue is enough to deter a lot of people (I would turn around and walk the other way if it were my first time there). As a local, I loathe the wait and would rarely go at peak hours. I tend to go near closing. Whether you enjoy lightly flavored dishes or have a passion for heavy flavor dishes they have something for you on their menu. Several dishes that stood out from my dining experience at the location: - steamed dumplings: They are bite size and the light broth is just right - dried sauteed string beans: really flavorful and great for going with rice - dry fried chicken wing: This is what people are raving about. When fresh, this dish is definitely one of the top wing dishes I've tried. In a nutshell: If you don't mind a noisy environment and a 15-30mins wait, it's definitely worth a try. But if you're looking for a quite meal in a quit environment, look elsewhere.

Met up my friend Tiffany for dinner here for around 8pm. Luckily i was running late for once and she beat me there. Good thing cause she was able to get a table for the two of us right away. Right when i got there parking was not the best since construction on Irving limited more parking. Also, a lined started to form outside and i was dying hungry since i last ate a meal around noon. Regarding the chicken, it was my first time ever eating here and i have heard and read all the rave about the chicken wings. First of all, most people seated already had some food but it took nearly 25min to get our 1 order of wings. At least are dumplings came out within 5 min as i would have starved to death. Dumplings were meh to me nothing special at all. So back to the chicken...I thought they were good and flavorful. It reminded of some chicken from a thai restaurant that i can't remember at the moment. Decent amount of wings and drumsticks given to us. Like others said I like how its not super drenched in sauce and still get the crunchy texture i like. I would definately come back but prolly not on a weekend as i figure it would be super packed or if anything i would order to go and pick it up.

What are they known for: Crispy chicken! If you dine in, you'll see almost all the tables get this. Apparently, it's very popular! I only wanted to try the chicken here but we ended up dining in as well for lunch. All their other dishes are pretty typical so I'll leave that out. All you want from here is their chicken! It depends how hungry you are but if you just want a snack, order one dish to share maybe? It's very flavorful and I like it how it's saucy but crispy at the same time! The sauce is kinda sweet but not too spicy. It reminds me of the sauce that they use for oysters at Chinese's restaurants? TIP: order next door when it's too crowded at the restaurant. Same owner! They serve the exact same food minus the longg longgg wait at the restaurant! It gets crowded alright around lunch/dinner!!

The food here is great.  The dried fried wings are 5 star.  All the other food I would say is 4 starred goodness.  All of their dough based dishes are really good.  It's not something most people notice but the quality of dough is great in their noodles.  The springiness of the dough in their dumplings is exceptional as well.  In dough, you are looking for the right thickness, resistance in bite, and the overall doneness when delivered to you.  San Tung gets these all right.  The sizzling rice soup is especially tasty and the dumplings/noodles are all really good.  I have to give them a deduction for their menu.  Not the paper itself but there are some items on there that just don't hold up to the standard items like the dry fried wings hold.  Items like the cherry chicken are uninspiring.  The dry fried string beans are decent but I've definitely had much better dry fried string beans so there are definitely areas for improvement.  Then there is the line.  expect to wait 40 minutes unless you get there around 11am when they open or around 5pm when sane people do not usually come out to eat dinner.  Pro-tip: when you go to San Tung, IMMEDIATELY go inside, turn right, you'll see a white-board, grab a marker, and write your name and party size.  That is their wait list and there is almost always a wait.  Furthermore, you can see just how long the list is so you can always give your chance to back out.  No one says you have to wait 30-40 minutes.  It's YOUR CHOICE! For some explanation for the Korean / Chinese hybrid theme at this place, San Tung is a different spelling of Shandong.  This is an area of China that is directly across the northern part of the East China Sea, which on the other side lies Korea.

This place seems to always be busy (even right before closing), and rightfully so! All around, San Tung has pretty good food. My favorite dishes were the Dry Diced Fried Chicken and Hot and Sour Soup. The chicken was sweet, but also had a slight kick. Towards the end of the dinner, the chicken bits became a little too sweet since it tasted like it was candied, but it was very enjoyable before it got to that point. The soup was lightly peppered and filled with delicious eggs! I love how they didn't skimp on any of the ingredients. We also had the Beef with String Beans. The dish was very good as the String Beans were cooked perfectly to a nice crunch. Normally this dish comes with chicken instead of beef, but since we already had a chicken dish, we had requested this dish to come with beef instead. The restaurant accommodated our request without a problem. Two other dishes we had, the Combination Fried Rice and Pork Dumplings, weren't very special, but still enjoyable. I would not mind coming again if given the chance!

Pros: Dry fried chicken wings! They really are the best chicken wings I've ever had and you'll see them on every table in the restaurant. Crispy, sweet, sticky, hot, moist, and flavorful. Other things I've tried - would I order them again? 1. Black bean sauce noodles (yes) 2. Sauteed string beans (yes) 3. Braised bean curd w/ vegetables (no) 4. Three deluxe spicy sauce noodles (no) 5. Deluxe vegetables (maybe) Cons: Parking is tough. Game of luck and patience.  Expect 1-1.5 hour wait for a table on the weekends for dinner. Weekday evenings ~10-15 minutes. No nonsense service. Expect speed, not friendliness. Overall, food is pretty greasy and they're a fan of drowning everything in sauce. The one time we paid with cash, they didn't bring any change and assumed a 20% tip, which I didn't appreciate. They were too busy to ever come back to our table once the bill came though. Despite that experience, those darn chicken wings continue to summon me back and really do lead to a satisfying meal every time!

So I have a slight addiction to Asian Chicken wings like bonchon or kyochon, etc etc. So when someone told me that there is this awesome chicken wing place not too far from where I live, I knew I had to check it out. So as a warning, this has to be the most difficult place to park at. Cars are always zooming around trying to grab a spot as they are limited so definitely buffer some time in for parking. You will know that you are at the right place because there will probably be a line out the door especially any time after 6 pm. The service is just okay and they don't really check on you. No issues because this place is more set up to be a get in, eat your food, and then get out which I am okay with as long as I'm getting these wings. I went there with three other people and we order the Dry wings as well as the wet wings, and the black bean noodles, along with the shrimp and leek dumplings. I would say the dumplings and noodles were solid and definitely enjoyable but why waste any stomach room on something other than the legendary wings. Both of the wings were awesome. They are flavorful, juicy, and have the nice amount of kick to them making them delicious.  The sauce that it is in has perfect hints of garlic and ginger making it a solid item to devour.  Definitely hit this place up but yes as everyone warns the service is not the greatest which is true but trust me when I say you will get over it once you take a bite into these wings.

Pros: Chicken wings---BEST chicken I have had!!!! String beans- cooked just right, not over cooked (limped) but still crunchy to the bite. Dumplings -ALL are tasty, steamy and fresh!   Mu Shu Pork- hmmmm....it's so tasty, just like comfort food. Love the sauce you put on it. Prices are right....especially for excellent food. Cons: Expect to wait an hour or more if you go on a weekend. I recommend a better waiting system...I feel you have to keep your eyes on the board to make sure no one erases it until you are called. Not a fancy place, but you come here for the food, not the atmosphere. Overall, I love the food at this place....even if I have to wait.

Wings! Wings! Wings! The thing to get here is definitely the Dry Fried Chicken Wings!  I took my mom and my sister her while the were visiting me this past weekend. I had a craving for some delicious asian food, because I do not eat it as frequently up in SF. San Tung definitely filled that void. Food: Nothing can compare to the Chinese food back home in the San Gabriel Valley, but San Tung is a satisfactory replacement. The Chicken Wings were crispy while covered in a spicy sweet sauce. Delicious! In addition to the wings I also liked the Tea Smoked Duck, eggplant, and honey walnut shrimp. The Tea Smoked Duck was like pecking duck and was super juicy. Overall the food was pretty tasty. Parking: The parking is a little difficult like anywhere in the city. We had to drive around several times until we finally found parking a few blocks away. Service: The service was pretty good. They were pretty busy, but our party of 7 was seated within 20 minutes of arrival. Once seated the servers were prompt and attentive. The food came out relatively quickly and drinks were quickly refilled. Overall a positive experience. As pretty much every review says: Try the Dry Fried Chicken Wings!

I'm really not a fan of Chinese food, but I love LOVE this place. My fiance and I went to New York 3 months prior to when when we found out about this place and while we were there, my cousin took us to this place that sold a dish that was called Bon Chon Chicken, or something close to that pronounciation. Anyway, ever since that day I've been craving those Chicken wings. I was talking to my co-worker about that best fried chicken that I ate in New York and when I was describing she said it sounds like the Chicken from San Tung and I should try it. A week later my fiance was craving Chinese food so I brought up San Tung. What we got.. We started out with Won Ton Soup which was absolutely fabulous! The wontons were plump and meaty and the shrimp and broth was amazing as well. Then we got the Famous Fried Chicken, which was in fact the same ones that I had in New York! I'm in trouble! I live about a 5-10 minute drive to this place. I know I'll end up being a regular for their Chicken! It had the right amount of crunch, which I love. Then we got string beans, which had a nice crunch to it. Even though it was braised a little, it still tasted healthy to me! Then last we ordered the potstickers. The potstickers were nice and plump. I can't really rate this one because I ate it when I had a tummy full of food, which cause that sick to my stomach feeling. I have to try it again. Our waiter was very friendly. Overall, I know we have found our Go-To Chinese restaurant! I would definately recommend this place. The only downfall is the wait. There are always people lining up. That just shows how good this place is!

Ok the wings are amazing, the best I've ever had! I understand why everyone talks about this place, but everything else is meh. Got here right before the dinner rush so we got seated immediately. Food: Wings are amazing come for these. The name of the restaurant in Chinese refers to a region in Northern China known for noodles, dumplings, and lots of stewed dishes. We decided to order stuff that is normally northern faire like dumplings and noodles. The dumplings were meh and the noodles were pretty bad...my friends couldn't finish them so I just gulped it down. Service: They're really nice. I spoke to them in Mandarin and felt like the service was good. They served us well and got all the orders out pretty fast. Price: It's fair priced I believe for SF, but I'm not sure a little on the pricey side if you're from the LA area. Would come back for the wings and maybe try some other dishes because we were a small group. This place is small and the line gets packed really quickly.

A mixed bag indeed.  WIth almost nothing but 4 and 5 star reviews from my friends, I came in with high hopes.  Unfortunately, some dishes shined while others fell painfully flat. Original Dry Fried Chicken WIngs: Delicious!  The sauce provided a great balance of peppery spice, garlic and sweetness while the skin was perfectly crisped to seal in all the juices. Dried Sauteed String Beans: Fresh and actually quite sweet, but the exteriors could've been more crispy given its preparation. Shrimp & Leek Dumplings: Finely diced filling and pretty tasty, but nothing out of the ordinary. Braised Bean Curd: Not fresh, way oversalted and inedible after the first bite.  Awful dish. Three Deluxe Spicy Sauce Noodles: The spice was there, too bad I can't say the same about flavor.  Again, old news after a couple bites and the seafood wasn't fresh either. Verdict?  The infamous chicken wings were very tasty though short of amazing.  Everything else...take it or leave it.  On the upside, prices were very reasonable and the service was good for a Chinese place.

I always come back for the wings. For the most part, the taste is consistent but sometimes it can be a little less saucey or more sticky. If I'm dining in, I always get a soup (won ton or hot and sour) and combination fried rice. They never fail me.

Do NOT come here for their over-priced Chinese food. You can get MUCH more authentic Chinese food in this area for cheaper and better quality. DO however, come here for their DRY FRIED CHICKEN!! Oh sooo crispy and good!!! The BEST fried chicken I've ever had! Lots of meat too, so it's not all just fried skin. Do NOT, I repeat, DO NOT get it to-go. It's really not the same, because it gets all soggy and gross. If you HAVE to get it to go, get the fried wet chicken. It's already coated in sogginess anyways. Most people like their dry fried chicken more than their wet ones, and I have to concur. Their wet chicken is just wayyyy too saucy. For three people, I think 2 plates of chicken (MAX!) is good enough. I felt disgusting afterwards, because their sauce was too heavy. My palate was overloaded, and no matter how much water and tea I drink, it just didn't clean my palate. This place is not one of those restaurants I'll come back to over and over again. Eating this everyday will make me SICK.

I've heard so many great things about this place so I had high hopes and was pretty excited to eat here! My friend and I were seated right away. We were given the menu promptly and about a minute after, I was asked if I was ready to order. I just barely opened the menu!!! Keep in mind that we arrived right at 11AM (at opening) so only 3 other tables had customers! It was not busy at all! So why hurry?? Since I didn't get to check out the menu yet I asked the waiter what is good on the menu and the guy said, "It doesn't matter." WTF?!?!?! What does he mean it doesn't matter?? I should've gotten up and left. I told him I needed more time and just checked yelp for suggestions! Thanks Yelpers! At least y'all are more helpful than the man that works there! Suggestions: The Chicken Wings and Curry Chicken are really good! And the bathroom is filthy!

So I was getting my hair cut in Napa by my favorite stylist ever, Cindy (at  Vanity for Guys and Dolls in Napa, totally worth the drive from SF http://www.yelp.com/biz/…)  Anyway, she told me about this really fun weekend she had with her friend that ended with the "best wings in the city."  I didn't even know that my favorite chinese food place was known bay-area wide as the best wings and she looked at me like I was so out of the loop. My dad and I LOVE San Tung and go there pretty regularly, more than any other place we've been.   One warning - they like their chili peppers and if you aren't big on heat order everything mild.  If you are a wimp like me, ask for no peppers. A few of my favorite things: -Dry Fried Wings.  These are seriously the most amazing thing on the menu, they are know bay area-wide for a reason.  Get them.  It is amazing how many orders you see coming out of that kitchen! -Mongolian beef.  A lot of places have that super thinly sliced kind of dry beef, this is moist and delicious, but definitely heavy on the peppers, just saying.   My dad generally judges a place by their mongolian beef, they passed :) -Chicken Chow Mein.  Lots of chicken and fresh veggies, absolutely delicious! -Pot Stickers.  Really yummy. Also, we get all of this for about $40 and usually order to go.  Plan on getting a pretty good amount of food, we usually have left overs, another bonus. If you plan to go there and eat any time, be prepared to wait.  If you order to go, plan to push through the crowd of people that are waiting!   Parking is rough as this is a popular area on Irving Street.  Either way, go get some San Tung!

Finally a restaurant that deserves all the hype. Been meaning to dry this place for a long time now, but the first time we got here around 6:30 on a Thursday evening it was an hour wait so we bounced. Second time we got here less than an hour before closing and got seated right away. Although there was no wait, the restaurant was still almost fully packed. What we ordered: Dry black bean noodle - pretty good Original Chicken Wings - definitely deserves an OMG The chicken here definitely lives up to the hype. Crispy, flavorful, and yet still moist. It rivals all but the best of the best Korean fried chicken. And to boot, everything on the menu is decently priced. Under $10 for 12 chicken wings. They also give you complimentary spicy chinese style kimchi. Service is typically of a chinese restaurant, but the food makes up for it. On the menu they also had smoked ducked with steamed buns. Will definitely have to come back to try that along with my own personal order of chicken wings.

This joint is so bumpin' you'd swear San Tung is passing out food for free. They're not... but the chicken wings are somewhat of a phenomenon that brings the crowds. The rest of the dishes are decent Chinese food, but nothing you can't find elsewhere. Always packed on weekends. To avoid the inevitable wait, order takeout.

There are no better deep fried chicken wings on the planet.  Also very good are either dumpling variation, fried potstickers and any dry fried dishes. Definitely a painful wait at times but if you get there early or late its usually not too bad. I bring all my friends or coworkers visiting SF here.

When I think Chinese food in San Francisco, I think of two things: cheap and generally authentic.  And so when I was recommended this place by a Chinese San Franciscan, I was a bit surprised to hear that their specialty was chicken wings.  When it comes to chicken wings I usually think about KFC or Popeye's or even sometimes Korean food but usually not Chinese.  And so I went to this place. THE GIST: Amazing chicken wings / Meh everything else SERVICE AND SETTING It's loud, a little dirty, crowded, and the servers are busy.  In other words, it's a typical casual Chinese restaurant in SF.  Expect to wait in line as usual. FOOD AND VALUE Wet Fried Chicken Wings: Chances are you probably went here for this.  Yes, they are indeed amazing.  They're packed with all sorts of mildly spicy flavors thanks to the glaze and the deep fried batter.  They're extremely moist.  They're some of the best chicken wings I've had.  For days after I found myself drooling in my sleep craving more of these succulent chicken wings. Szechuan Tea Smoked Duck: Unfortunately, things fell a bit after the chicken wings.  It was a little dry, not very meaty.  While I'll almost always enjoy a Chinese duck platter, this one was quite forgettable. Pork Dumpling: Also mediocre.  Not much to say about them. For a San Franciscan restaurant this popular, the prices are slightly below average.  For the quality of the food, the value is quite good. CONCLUSION Go here for the chicken wings.  Nothing else compares.  Nothing else matters.

San Tung serves amazingly addictive and delicious dry fried chicken wings. It's a popular dish that is most likely ordered at every table. I don't like eating any type of meat off the bone, mainly because I don't like to get my fingers sticky or greasy, but I make an exception for San Tung's dry fried chicken wings. They're very sticky and sweet, not spicy at all. A few drumsticks are given, but the majority of the plate is wings. They're deep fried and remain crunchy, even when soaked in the fantastic sauce. The meat falls off the bone so easily and I find myself cleaning the bone down to the last drop of sauce. Ah, love at first bite. While I enjoyed their Szechuan tea smoked duck dish, I wouldn't order it again because I found it difficult to eat. The duck didn't fall off the bone easily, so I found myself needing to gnaw it off, which just wasn't worth the time. However, the duck was very flavorful and juicy. It's deep fried, so the skin is very crunchy, fatty, and delicious. The salty and smoky flavors are great. The lotus buns that came with the dish were nice and chewy. The mushroom, bamboo shoots, and snow peas in garlic sauce dish was pretty good for a veggie dish. The sauce was not garlicky enough, but it was surprisingly thick and creamy. The bamboo shoots and snow peas have a nice crunch, and the mushrooms were very meaty. The black bean sauce noodles comes with beef, shrimp, and calamari drenched in a thick, slightly salty but savory black bean sauce over noodles. The noodles are kind of sticky and difficult to pry apart at first, but the creamy sauce lubricates them well. Shrimp was lacking, but beef and calamari was plentiful and fresh too. "This is a Chinese restaurant" is a sufficient enough reason to explain the non-existent service. They're very quick with taking orders, so it's helpful to know what you want immediately after sitting down. But to avoid the crowds and lines, order to-go instead.

Like everyone has already said, the dry fried chicken wings are a MUST. You have not lived life until you have had these chicken wings! I first came into this restaurant having not heard any of the hype around it, so had no idea that what I was about to eat was gonna be life changing. So yes, there are a lot of people raving about their chicken wings, and yes, it is well deserved. I lick my fingers everytime and am not ashamed. The main reason why I knocked off a star from this place is because the rest of the food is just so-so. Standard chinese fare and nothing special. I feel like it is almost unfair giving such a high rating to a restaurant just based on one dish, but I can't help it! Those wings are addictive! The service here could also use some work. There a couple of people who work here that need practice smiling or should find a job that doesn't make them so miserable. Take a trip to Disneyland or something.

Finally had a chance to try these famous chicken wings on a trip to SF.  They were nicely crisp on the outside but soft and moist on the inside.  Perfect.  We got the dry ones which are coated with a sweet sauce.  The stars are only for the wings as I can't attest to anything else.  Arrive early otherwise you will be stuck in line.

Food: Fried Chicken Wings: the skin is very crispy and the meat is moist.  The sweet and spicy sauce complements the wings very well.  recommend. Pork&White Cabbage Dumplings: very bland.  do not recommend. Tomato and Beef Chow Mein: flavorful, but i would opt out for the black bean noodles if I go back to this restaurant.   Parking: Street parking.  The Roomie and I drove around for 1.5 HOURS just to find parking. go figure :/ Overall: The food was good and the wait was minimal.  There were construction going on when we went, so that was probably the reason for the lack of parking spaces.  The chicken wings are definitely worth a try.  They also have a lunch special menu (11-3pm) if you ever go during lunch time.

Came here for the Dry-Fried Chicken Wings featured on the 7x7 Big Eat. http://www.7x7.com/big-e… Am I the only person who DOESN'T like their famous wings?! We got an order togo because the restaurant was really busy and it took 20-30 minutes to get our wings! There were about 12 in a box for ~$10. Honestly, these were too sweet for me, and I don't think they mixed their sauce well because every single wing varied in flavors. One would be sweet, another would be spicy and the next would be a combination of both. They were also really sticky and too saucy for me but that may be because I was expecting dry wings because of its name. I can't say anything about their other food because I haven't had it, but based solely on the wings, I don't think I'll be back.

This place is gooood. The short list: Get the dry fried chicken wings (definitely the best thing here, the sauce is amazing and the chicken is fried crispy on the outside and succulent on the inside!).  I've also tried the ja jiang myun and can say it ain't bad.  The shrimp & leek dumplings are also a good compliment to the wings. All in all if you go here, you gotta get the wings. This place is one of the iconic foodie restaurants in SF, so you gotta swing by here when you get the chance! Food ain't priced badly either! NOTE: Service here is bad and the waiters here are really rude; typical chinese restaurant service.

12/25/2012 My first time at San Tung Chinese Restaurant, and I was impressed! My friend and I decided to hang out since we both had no plans whatsoever, and she said "lets go to San Tung, their chicken wings are the bomb!" It's definitely a hole in the wall, which made the wait time - not exceptionally long, but long enough to make our mouths water! Then again, it was Christmas Day, so long lines are expected. When we were finally seated, we ordered: both (1)dry & wet chicken wings (to taste and see which one we like better) - the dry wings were sweet and savory with just enough sauce to coat + the wet wings were more on the savory side with a hint of black pepper sautéed in a mushroom broth [we both contend that the dry wings were our favorite] , (2) black bean sauce noodles - full of shrimp, vegetables and scallops, the noodles were exceptionally good, though a bit hard to serve since they were long strands, (3) pork dumplings - fresh and delicious [nearly every table we saw ordered them, & (4) honey walnut prawns - something that I like to order, the combination of crisp walnuts battered in honey and the prawns fried then smothered in mayo [it was good, and the prawns were definitely fresh]. I took home some of the leftover wings, and they were still good even after being in the fridge. i don't really eat fried chicken, well, only on certain occasions, such as Popeye's $1.29 for two or when I'm in Chinatown (deep fried in peanut oil). The difference is in taste and texture that makes San Tung's chicken wings unique - not heavily deep fried, and coated in a sweet+savory sauce with your pick of either wet or dry. This is a great place for comfort Chinese food!

This is basicaly a Korean interpretation of Chinese food restaurant and is quite unique in San Francisco. I know about this as I once walked into a Chinese restaurant in Honolulu--only to be met with mostly Korean patrons and workers, with Korean menus and all! I really enjoyed the food, especially the dumplings. I have been to this restaurant about 5 times already and the first 4 times, the famous chicken wings were great; however, the last time I went, the chicken was not as good as I remembered. It might be due to different workers preparing it, or I might be having one of those days where I was a bit critical. Service is good, my girlfriend accidently dropped the glass and it and the plate shattered into tiny piece. About three workers ran up and quickly cleared the mess--very attentive of them! We were not sure if we were going to be charged for the broken plate and glass; however, we were not charged for them. It was very sweet for them so we gave them a larger tip to cover for the expenses. The wait is long, and can take an hour--but if you have never tried Korean interpretation of Chinese food, you should definitely try it at least once!

3000+ reviews!?!.. Only in SF.. This place is definitely as good as it's hyped up to be and very authentic.  For food we tried the fried chicken wings, black bean noodles with pork, and dried sauteed string beans.  Everything was delicious.  The interior feels somewhat cramped and even on a Saturday afternoon around 2:30pm we had to wait for 20 minutes for a table for 4.   Overall good food experience, but am unlikely to come here frequently due to the wait.

San TUNG you suck. I call in my order at 4:30 PM, you tell me 25 minutes. that means 4:55. I think to myself, they are ALWAYS BEHIND, let' go pic up the food at 5:15. YOU KNOW WHAT TIME MY ORDER WAS READY? 6:15 !!! I called at 4:30! That's almost 2 hours...I waited in that crappy small as a sardine box waiting area for an hour, with my ass in someone's face as they are trying to eat their dinner. You have to shift back and forth between servers, it's nuts.  If you wonder why your neighbors get mad, it's because of all of the musical parking that you have to do because YOU don't give your customers an honest pick up time! I could care less if I called in and you said, wow we are busy, your order wont be ready for an hour and a half. I'd then be there in an hour and a half,  but for the love of jesus, BE HONEST WITH YOUR CUSTOMERS ABOUT PICK UP TIMES! People are tired of the lies, many of my friends joke about it and say the same thing, you'll say it will be ready by 5:00, but you know to be there an EXTRA 30 minutes later @ 5:30. THE FOOD AIN'T ALL THAT GREAT EITHER. Ok my rant is done, but my time is just as valuable as yours san tung, please try to remember that.

yup, the dry chicken wings are great. crispy, glazed, tender, sweet, salty, delicious. I absolutely hate waiting in line and would not endure an hour+ wait for them though. I went at 11:30a on a weekday and the restaurant was about half full. By 12p there were people waiting for a table. oh i almost forgot about their complimentary spicy pickled cabbage! SO GOOD. can i buy that stuff on the side?? service was good, quick, to the point. like all chinese restaurants should be. As a first-timer, i also ordered what others call "the staples" : black bean noodles, pork dumplings, and dry fried green beans. Honestly, none of those stood out to me. I think there are plenty of better dumpling places (at least in SM) and the seafood in the noodles was really tough. I like flash fried/dried string beans but i can also get them at any other chinese take out place. 4 stars it is then (5 for the wings, 3 for the other dishes)

San Tung does have really good chicken wings. If you go there, you should always order: the chicken wings. Just ask for it - they know what you're talking about. It's always usually very busy and the wait can be awhile. So we ordered a lot of dishes here and here are some notes on the memorable ones: 1. Green beans - I thought I like them but I noticed they put sugar in them. It's slightly sweet but I like the crispiness in them. 2. Chicken Wings - we got two orders of them and you can't go wrong. However, I do think if you eat them too much, they aren't as special as they used to be. I remember when I first ate them, they were amazing and now, they're good but it doesn't leave the same impact! 3. Kim-Chi Noodles - It wasn't the black bean noodles but instead it had this red, spicy sauce on it. I like it though because I like the kick and flavor to it. Service: It is a Chinese restaurant. They sit you, give you water and utensils, take your order and serve you your food, and you're left alone. If you need service, wave them down like crazy. They are running around trying to do things and they don't care what's going on as long as you got your food. To avoid the long lines, you can always do take-out. I do that a lot and NextDoorSweets apparently has the chicken wings!

WOW!  I did a quick Yelp search and the high reviews caught my attention.  So we went to the restaurant and the place was packed (and this was about 3:30 in the afternoon!)  We ordered sweet and sour pork and almond chicken to go.  It took about 45 minutes but we expected a long wait.  By the time our order was complete there was a crowd of people outside the restaurant waiting to be seated.  (tell-tale sign this place was good).  Our food was amazing!  Our second visit included the chicken wings (which are very popular) and once again we were very satisfied with our meal.  I live in SoCal but if I'm in the area this will be on my priority list.

Heard about this place since long time ago, tonight we tried it finally, I saw a pic from a yelper, it looks yummy. For sure we had order the Dry fried chicken wings, and we had Black bean sauce noodles, Shrimp and leek dumplings and Hot and sour soup(I'm not big fan of this soup). All yummy in my experienced, hmm... dumplings were taste good dip with the vinegar with spicy sauce, my little monster ate half bowl of Black bean sauce noodles. I'm wondering how could they made the chicken wings that crispy. We all hella like it !

This is a review for a take-out meal that my husband and I purchased. The restaurant was packed when we went and I always take that as a great sign that the food is good.  They managed to cook our big order quickly which pretty impressive. The almond chicken was bland but at least the pieces of chicken they used were really tender. Also, there wasn't much almonds in the "almond chicken". The black bean noodles was pretty tasty although it had a strong seafood scent to it. It actually tasted different the next day because the seafood smell became stronger.  It was just too funky for me to eat the next day so I threw it away.  I really hate wasting food!  The potstickers were huge and the filling was really good. I just wish they had a really good sauce to dip them in, aside from the soy sauce that was provided. The fried rice is also good but it's nothing different from the fried rice you get at Panda Express. The best dish we got here was the Dry Fried Beef.  My husband and I definitely inhaled that in one sitting. The sauce was amazing and the beef was perfectly crispy. I was really happy that the beef they used was tender and it definitely was far from being "beef jerky" status.  I would come back to this restaurant just to get my hands on this dish again. I was actually disappointed because my mind wasn't blown by the dishes that we bought. At 3000+ reviews with four stars, I was expecting to have a foodgasm....but sadly, my tastebuds weren't titillated at all. Perhaps, the food would be better if we ate at the restaurant? Maybe next time we will eat in the restaurant. Hopefully my tastebuds will be happier the next time around.

Long waits with so-so service, but the DRY CHICKEN WINGS are definitely worth the wait and the hype!!  CRISPY HONEY'd bites of joy. The other foods I've tried have been good, but over-hyped and not unique. Order TO-GO, and come pick up 1 hour later (even though they say "45 minutes," it's really 1 hour).

I groaned when my friend dragged me out to the Inner Sunset to have what she claims is "the best fried chicken in San Francisco".   It's... all the way out there.  Little did I know, that of the group, which included two really big guys who usually have far bigger appetites than I, I'd end up eating the most.  Licking every bone clean. For four, we ordered hot and sour soup, dry black bean sauce noodles, pork with dry bean curd, and of course, two orders of their dry fried chicken.  Being a down home Chinese restaurant, there's no specific order in which the food comes out and their famous dry fried chicken happened to come first, which I didn't mind at all.  In fact, I'm glad it came first because it allowed me to make a decision early in the meal to not waste the valuable real estate in my stomach on any of the other dishes. Because that dry fried chicken is EVERY BIT AS GOOD AS EVERYONE SAYS IT IS. The sauce was thick, sticky, sweet, and tangy.  Even though the chicken was drenched in it, the exterior of it still had a major crunch, which housed perfectly moist and seasoned meat.  By the way, these aren't ginormous chicken wings and drumsticks; it's a lot of little ones.  I say that because I'm not the biggest fried chicken fan to begin with and I'm pretty lazy when it comes to food with bones, so for me to plow through a plate of mini fried chicken wings and drumsticks is a testament to how good it is. When my friend started to offer the last drumstick around, the other two threw in the towel/napkin while I said, "Dude, it's mine".  When I finished, I proudly showed off my heaping plate of bones, "Check it.  Count it", to which they remarked, "Damn, we didn't realize that this was a contest".  Sore losers. :D

I'm sad because what used to be one of my very favorite restaurants is no longer a favorite. Every time we tried to flag down a waiter they would look the other way.  All of their waitstaff has changed and not for the better. But I guess from their point of view, do less work since they get paid by the hour anyway. I wasn't too pleased with this. We got our food really fast after ordering. Didn't think this was going to be bad but the dry fried chicken wings were lukewarm at best. Then when we bit into them they were still a little red inside. They have to have also changed chefs. Then the black bean sauce noodles had barely any seafood in them. Two shrimps and two scallops. Noodles still tasted good but didn't seem proportional. We had to let them know about the chicken wings because we didn't want anyone to get salmonella. They gave us 4 new chicken wings which were cooked like how they should be. We were regular customers so we know the manager but he avoided us when we wanted to let him know about the wings.  I have no hard feelings because I know it's not easy to run a restaurant.

So basically I came here for one thing which was the Dry Fried Chicken wings.  Was it hype or was it a myth.  I was surprised when we showed up around noon on a Saturday that they had a couple tables opened.  I was expecting a crowd based on what I heard.  They did have a wipe board for names that was ready for 30 but I guess luck was on our side.  This place was really well staffed especially for a Chinese restaurant so getting sat and getting started was fast and efficient. As soon as we sat down the line begun to form and they hype began to back itself up.  Had we showed up 10 minutes later we'd be 8-10 groups deep.  We ordered four dishes. Combination Noodles, Pork Dumplings, Mushrooms and Bamboo shoots, and of course the Chicken Wings.  The food showed up quickly and guess what, the chicken wings were phenomenal.  Surprisingly the other 3 dishes were excellent as well. They weren't ground breaking but they certainly weren't textbook flavor wise. This was simply very good Chinese food that accompanies one hell of a plate of Chicken Wings.  If you are in the area it's worth a stop in.   If you are in the mood for chicken wings then make the extra effort.

Ok, heres the scoopy poo. The original dry wings are 4.5 stars (they would be 5, but the sauce they use is pretty sweet. Yes I know, youd think, "dry" would mean sauceless?? Not here..surprise!) Anyhow, we had to wait 30 mins in this little crowded hole in the wall to be seated..*the service was pretty bad (but we understand they were slammed!)* We sit and wait another 30 mins to get our food=/ The rice came first and got cold by the time the rest got to our table, the shrimp and leek dumplings were ok..we hoped they would be bigger like pot stickers and have a bit more flavor (oh well, bring on the wings baby!) And of course, the wings blew us away (less sweet sauce next time??) Then the veggie chow mein came. Not very good. It was typical crappy Chinese food at this point. Then came the undercooked pork and willow fungus garlicky mess. Again, not a winner. We both agreed we would come back, but under the conditions that it was for WINGS ONLY! P.S. You tend to get a ton of rude stares by hungry folks wanting to steal your table..my advice? Get another plate of wings=D

I don't understand all the people who give this place 5 stars based on a single dish.  Get real. I ordered the famous Dry Fried Chicken Wings... and they were pretty good.  A bit too much sweet for my taste, but that's a small nit-pick.  A 4-star item I'd say. That aside, we ordered some hot-and-sour soup, which was pretty solid, and some steamed pork dumplings, which were pretty flavorless.  3-stars for the remaining dishes. The service was pretty contemptible.  They hardly made eye contact with us and made us feel like we were just taking up space.  Not to mention that this place is always packed but you can't call ahead to get on the list.  2-star service.

Tip one: When in the Sunset- bring a jacket, preferably one that is filled with down as it is colder than the arctic circle here. Tip two: Eat at San Tungs. You may just pass San Tung by- thinking it is another hole in the wall Chinese food place- however, listen to your friends who live here and pay attention to the groups of people gathered outside the door- waiting and waiting to get their hands on some dry fried chicken (wet) and fried pot stickers. There is a reason that this place has a solid 4 stars on Yelp by almost 3k people- its good.  Everything on the menu is delicious, well prepared and fairly priced. Prawns in Lobster sauce (eat over rice) Garlic Chicken (mmmm, garlic) Dry Fried Chicken (better than Hooters) Fried Pot Stickers (Thick layer that is best drowned in black vinegar) And as our dinner companion- Stella said "Remember, there is a pepper for every occasion"

I can't say that I really had the experience, but my friend Kathy and I wanted to try it before heading out from San Francisco. She told me they are known for their Dried Fried Chicken and they are to die for. We went during dinner time and unfortunately, this place is super crowded. Little tight spacing for even to-gos. It didn't take too long for us to order two of the Dried Fried Chicken orders. Place is pretty efficient, but next time I'll try eating in for once and see if I could get the full experience. But as for the chicken to die for, I concur it was bomb. Expectations of the spicy and sweet sauce on it was delicious! I'll probably change my rating after I have really eaten in the restaurant.

You know the left column of your Yelp profile that asks, "What would your last meal on earth be?" Well, I considered changing my current answer to "A meal at San Tung." Ah, San Tung. This place was incredibly hyped up, but you know what? The food met the hype! First off, I've always gone near 9PM (9:30PM is when they close) and there is practically no wait at all (which makes sense). Of my two trips here, I've had: - Chicken Wings (MUST) - Fried Rice (MUST... flavorful and infused with crack or something that must be equally addicting) - Dumplings (YES) - Green Beans (Nice way to balance out your meal) - Garlic Eggplant   - Hot and Sour Soup (Perfect taste... not too watery, not too salty) I'll go again and again, and would go every weekend if I could!

Hands Down! Best Asian Chicken Wings Ever! Note: This review is based solely on the chicken wings as I have not had anything else here. We were driving past this place on a Saturday morning around 11. My friend who had been to San Tung before asked if we wanted to try it. No one really seemed to care/couldn't decide so I just decided to say "no" as it would be kind of a hassle to turn around and go back at this point. Then my friend told me to check it out on Yelp because the chicken wings are suppose to be really good. After looking at a picture of their popular wings, my mouth began to salivate and I knew I had made a grave mistake by denying us of these succulent pleasures. "TURN THIS CAR AROUND, WE HAVE TO GO BACK" And so we did. :) BEST DECISION EVER! Since this wasn't a planned stop, we decided to just be quick and order what we came in for -- some finger-licking good chicken wings. We got one plate of the original dry wings and one plate of the wet wings. They were both good, but the original dry ones were definitely better. They were smothered with less sauce which I think allowed the skin to be much crispier. Not sure what the sauce is made of, probably something along the lines of soy, ginger, garlic, mixed with crack. SO BOMB. This place gets packed around meal times. I think we got there just in time to beat the lunch rush, which was right around the time they opened. I can't wait for the day I come back and indulge once more in these foodgasm-inducing wings.

This place is great although now a little overcrowded. I used to come to this joint since I was a kid growing up in the Sunset and went to the little hole in the wall they had on Irving and 20th. They home make their noodles and the dry fried chicken wings are the best. Typical 2 person order for me is 2 orders of wings, 1 to eat, 1 to go, beef noodle soup, dan dan mein and 1 order of pork dumplings with leek. This gives me enough to eat and enough for leftovers the next day since I no longer live in the city. Get there, get your name on the wall and chow down. * Quick tip: If you just want to try the wings go next door where one of the brothers will make it up for you without having to wait.

This place is vastly overrated. Waiters are rude and unhelpful, and everything is way too salty. San Tung is not worth the wait or the hype.

Good food, good place. However, the chicken was not as amazing as I had hoped... everyone kept telling me (Yelp included) how mind-blowing-ly amazing it was going to be. I mean, it's good and all, but not the best of my life. Maybe in the top 10. And yes... I am a bit jaded when it comes to fried chicken (I actually like Korean fried chicken the best). The other food (ex. my staple, Dry Beef Chow Fun) was good and worthwhile. It's a good Chinese restaurant at a good price. It has a good vibe too--makes you feel right at home. I'd definitely come back if I was in the area. And I'd probably get the chicken again. I would just know what to expect.

We waited forever on a Friday night to try the dried fried chicken that my friend was raving about.  We ordered the dried fried chicken, shrimp dumplings, and baby bokchoy with mushrooms.  The dried fried chicken was good (most things taste good when fried, right?), but left a strange aftertaste in my mouth.  The shrimp dumplings and baby bokchoy were nothing to write home about.  I still give this place 3 stars since I do want to come back to try the wings.  I love Kyochon, so I am eager to compare it to Kyochon's wings.

Just like everyone else: TRY THE CHICKEN WINGS! This place is one of the things that convinced me to move across the country to San Francisco.  I have *never* had such amazing wings, and I come from the South! The only complaint is the service (very quick and unfriendly), but the food easily makes up for it.  Also, I wish they delivered. :(

Dried fried chicken lives up to its hype. Best chicken I ever had...so crispy on the outside and juicy inside. My only complaint is the long wait. If you live by here... Definitely do take out otherwise its worth the wait. Also, the place next door offers the same fried chicken (I heard it is owned by the same person), but it's not the same. It was a little overlooked when I had it there. Definitely sticking to the original...

Came here to try their wings at 3pm on a Saturday hoping to escape the crowds, but still faced a 40min wait. Screw that, we got it to go, and instead had a picnic on the hood of the car! My assessment of the order: Dry chicken wings- THE default item to get. Crispy, spicy and awesomely fresh. 9.99 for about 12 big wings Wet chicken wings- something to try: slathered in a sweet and sour cause and tossed with mushrooms and shoots. If you had to choose, go for the dry over the wet. Black seafood noodles- overrated. Spaghetti noodles with some seafood sauce with small shrimp and calamari. It was very oily but also very popular Definitely will be back for the dry chicken wings

Finally made it here on a Sunday night. Now I understand all the raves about San Tung fried chicken. I love every dish we ordered: Dry chicken wings, Wet diced chicken, dumplings, fried dumplings (different from pot stickers. I think we ordered this by mistake and it turns out to be good). String beans are always good here. You need some veggies after ordering so many meat dishes. Pork strips with dried beancurd is also a good non-spicy dish to complement the meal.

I only got their wings and the black bean noodle. I have no idea what the hype is all about.  I heard this place is owned be Koreans and not Chinese people (I don't really care, just wanted to point it out)?  So they make their own version of Korean Wings.   It's okay?  It's a bit overpriced but I don't see what all the hype is about.  It's not like it's not good, but most wings are pretty good in general, but this place doesn't serve anything amazing.  From what I heard the other food is just average and i would believe it based on the black bean noodle I got.  The wings are worth it every now and then. The place is always pretty busy so prepare for a wait, and better yet, order to go and skip the wait!

Original dry fried chicken wings = SO GOOD. I came here a while back on a Thursday evening, had to wait somewhere between 30 minutes to an hour for a table for 3 people. So when we were driving past on a Saturday morning around 11 and there was no line outside... we ended up stopping by even though we had no plans to originally. Definitely glad we did though! We tried both the original dry fried chicken wings (dry) and the dry fried chicken wings (wet). The original dry wings are the more popular ones, we got our food just a few minutes after ordering. I guess they just make chicken wings all day long since everybody orders them anyway :) I did notice that the table next to us ordered boneless dry wings and they took a lot longer to come out. The dry wings have a little bit of sauce on them, but they were a lot crispier than the wet wings. They tasted similar, the only thing that was really different was the amount of sauce and a few extra veggies in the sauce. Both were good but I would choose the dry wings! I've also tried the dry fried green beans... meh. Pretty overrated, in my opinion. They weren't super flavorful and not as dry/wrinkly as the green beans at other places. Fatima in Cupertino has my favorite green beans for sure! Anyway, I guess the secret to not having to wait in line is to come around when they open! Around 30 minutes after they had opened, there started to be a line.

I must say this was just an A-OK experience. My boyfriend, sister, and I came on a Friday night and waited about 40 minutes to be seated. We of course ordered the chicken wings (dry) as well as a few other dishes, including the black bean sauce noodles and a slimy tofu dish. The wings were very good (reminded me of Bon Chon which doesn't exist on the west coast). A negative was the sauce was kind of clumpy. The slimy tofu dish looked unappetizing although it was pretty good. The black bean sauce noodle dish (which I only ordered cause people raved about it) looked like clumpy sauce with noodles. It also was bland and kept reminding me that I was eating slimy poo (sorry!). I packed it to go to see if I would have an appetite for it later, and I ate a few bites for dinner last night, and almost threw up (sorry!). It just doesn't bring good thoughts to mind and tastes somewhat fishy and bland. Overall, just an OK experience. Would probably not come back (since you can skip the wait and get their wings next door).

Weird hour dining avoids lines again, 2 PM is the way to go. And thank goodness because the food would not have tasted as good had I had to wait. "Kimchi" - Revolting Black Bean Noodles - Korean style - Bland and mostly sauce Dry Fried Chicken Wings - Good, not Bon Chon level though Grean Beans - Solid Shrimp & Leek Dumplings - Go to Ranch 99 and buy some frozen dumplings and boil, save a few $ For the exact same thing (Chinese/Korean mishmash) done better, go to SO instead.

I have been here numerous time and as most people talk about the wait it can be pretty hectic.  But whenever I go it usually right after work to avoid the dinner rush.  I've had to wait about an 45 mins to and hour before but well worth the wait.   The dry fried chicken wings are so friggin good!  I love chicken wings too and I wish I knew how to make this myself.   I would have given San Tung 5 stars, the food definitely deserves it.  But they were closed for about 2 weeks for renovation but when I went in after the renovation everything was the same.  I think they just went on vacation.

Basically, only come here for the Original Dry-Fried Chicken Wings.  Those are absolutely amazing.  (My gf calls them crack wings given their addictive properties).  Everything else besides the wings and maybe the black bean sauce noodles are mediocre at best.  Things tend to be overseasoned. "Crack wings": 5 stars Black bean noodles: 4 stars Everything else: 1.5 stars But given the fact that we almost always only order the wings and the noodles, I'll average it out to 4 stars.

I'd by pass all the other dishes and purely come here to eat the chicken. Can be a tad on the sweet side for some (and especially after you've gone through 5 drumsticks and 5 chicken wings) but nevertheless good! Be prepared for the wait at least once in your life and go see what all the chicken fuss is about.

Best chicken wings ever - hands down. Got the dried wings with my wife and she devoured them even though she hates chicken wings. Their wings could turn a vegetarian into a carnivore. The sauce is so good you want to at the bone. The seaweed soup is awesome and makes you feel like a million bucks. Prices and portions are good. The place gets busy so the wait sucks. But, best thing comes to those who wait in this case.

My cousin & her family were visiting from China and wanted to grab good Chinese food at the last minute - of course I thought of San Tung, and since they didn't mind skipping the crazy wait at the main restaurant and ordering off the same menu next door, we came here and got a table after a 5 minute wait! Major props to the staff here who were patient through my cousin's indecisiveness and basically choosing the dishes (and asking everyone's opinion at the table AS she was ordering with the server waiting), her two kids who were pretty pumped up and energetic, running around, being noisy, etc, and helping us pack up this crazy amount of food. I made sure they got a good tip! * Beef tripe ($6.00) - 3 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_… I think I'm not very into this dish normally, hence the average rating. It was fine, had a mild spicy flavor, but nothing I would write home about. * Pork dumplings ($6.75) - 4 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Cross-section: http://www.yelp.com/biz_… As before, the skin is thick and soft, fresh. The ground pork inside juicy and still fairly loose. Tastes pretty good with some soy sauce and vinegar. * Seafood soup noodles ($9.00) - 3 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Average - the noodles were on the harder side, which I actually like, and works well with soup. The soup itself is much more veggies however, and just a few pieces of shrimp & squid. * Dry fried chicken wings ($9.50) - 5 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Yum - of course, their signature dish, fantastic as always! * Veggie fried rice w/ egg ($6.25) - 4 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Although this was a pretty simple dish and I actually didn't feel much like eating it, I found myself drawn to it increasingly because it smelled so amazing. I can't really put my finger on what it was, but the rice was soft and it was well flavored as a dish. The eggs were cooked nice & soft too. * Twice cooked pork ($9.00) - 2 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Not impressed. What little pork there was under all veggies that were essentially taking up space (mostly cabbage, a little bit of peppers) were really hard and not tasty. * Black mushroom/bok choy ($8.00) - 3.5 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_… A solid veggie dish. They maybe over-starched the sauce as it was crazy thick, and the mushrooms had a really strong flavor so they should have cut them into smaller pieces than halves. * Hot braised bean curd ($8.00) - 3.5 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_… The bean curd pieces were nicely done, soft and with a good skin to chew through. The veggies once again could be cut into smaller pieces, and they could have had better choices (not a big fan of the cucumber, carrot, baby corn combo. They always seem like cheap fillers to me).

Chicken. Chicken. Chicken. Chicken? Chicken! Chicken... .... ...Chicken Yes, the chicken here is very very good. I ate the Korean style wings they had here shortly after coming back from eating some of the most amazing chicken wings in Seoul, and these come very close (sorry, but you can't beat the original and authentic). Nonetheless, the chicken wings had the perfect mix of sweet, crispy, sticky and spicy. I will definitely be coming here again for them. I also ordered some hoisin noodles, and I wasn't too big of a fan of those.. I guess the chicken just overshadowed the rest of the food.

You really do have to go here just for the chicken wings! I've been here multiple times, and never get tired of those wings.  Other than that though, San Tung is a great place to get your chinese fix.  Whatever you may want, they have it.  Everything else may be not as great as the chicken wings, but they do get the job done. Service is fast and for a meal for 2, after you get seated, you could probably get out of there within 30 minutes.  The wait can vary depending on the time you go there.  Dinnertime around 6-8 is probably the busiest, and there will be a line out the door, but if you get here by 5:30 or 8:30, it shouldn't be as big of a problem. Tip: some of the things could be a tad bland, so I'd suggest usually ordering spicy unless you really can't handle it.

Came here because the yelp review is super high... As expected, the entire restaurant is very crowded and they did not accept reservation that is under party of 6. So me and my friends ended up waiting for 2 hours roughly. We ordered - seafood soup - noodle with peanut sauce - fried pot sticker: we like the pot sticker. The skin is thick but very tasty. - and the signature fried chicken with honey sauce In general, I will say this place is pretty decent for authentic Chinese food. However, I only gave it a 3 because it was under what I expected and I don't think the wait should be this long for this kind of food!

Parking may be difficult as they don't have a private parking lot and spots for street parking can be competitive with the street littered with restaurants. You write your name and the number of your party on the white board next to the entrance, and they will call your name when a table is ready. The wait can be quite long. However, it is very much worth the hassle of parking and the long wait for a table. NOTE: this is not an authentic Chinese restaurant. It's a combination of American and Korean style Chinese food with complimentary Chinese style kimchi. We came as a large group and was able to try quite a few dishes. The dumplings are hand-made and quite juicy. The fried chicken is super crispy and drenched in a sweet, slightly spicy sauce, which may be difficult to remove if you decide to toss the chopsticks and eat with your fingers. The black bean noodles are quite good with the sauce not too sweet or salty and the noodles are hand-made. The spicy seafood noodles are okay and have an ample serving of seafood with hand-made noodles. The chow mien comes with a generous portion of meat. The only dish that could be improved was the sweet and spicy shrimp. It was a bit too sweet and the sweetness drowned out the other flavors.

Been a while since I went to San Tung! They have the best chicken wings!  SOOOO GOOD!! Was a bit surprised to see a table full of black people at a Chinese restaurant. But you know what they say about black people and their chicken! =P It's no joke! San Tung's chicken wings was too legit too quit! The line, on the other hand, was not fun. We waited about 45 minutes to eat here but after one bite of those crispy tangy wings everything seemed OK. We also ordered the jajangmien and the fried beef this time. The jajangmien is lacking! Scallops are now potatoes. Boo!! Sauce was too watery too! :( Beef tenders were delicious although I would have preferred them more peppery/ spicy. Don't care. Will come back for chicken wings.

NOTICE: San Tung will be closed for remodel between 9/12-9/26 so beware of that! I came here over the weekend since my sister was craving chicken wings. I wasn't planning on ordering anything though because it seemed most of the more popular dishes were meaty, but I decided to peruse the menu anyway. We planned to get take-out and good thing we didn't try to get a table since it was PACKED and every table was full. There was a pretty long waiting list and people were crowding outside too. Dang, definitely a sign that this place is good. What I ordered: - Vegetarian Steamed Potstickers ($7): comes with 6 potstickers filled with napa cabbage, zucchini, mushrooms, garlic http://www.yelp.com/biz_… You have to go to the back of the restaurant where the counter/register is to order food to-go and originally, the waiter told us our food would be ready in 30 minutes, but then changed his mind after seeing my jaw drop and said to come back in 15-20 instead. They have small containers of hot sauce, hot sauce oil, and soy sauce for you to grab when you get your order which is nice! The potstickers were pretty big and came in a plastic container on a bed of cabbage. They were really yummy and the skin was very soft, so my chopsticks kept poking through it, causing some of the filling to fall out -__- I took some hot sauce to try and poured some on, but I found it to be a little too strong and spicy, so it kind of overpowered the taste of the veggies in the potstickers. Therefore, I ate the rest of them just plain but they were good that way! Pretty filling meal and I could only eat 5 out of the 6, but that might have been due to getting boba right beforehand. Not sure if they use MSG though since my sister said she was super thirsty after eating her food. I was alright though, but maybe my body just isn't as sensitive?

I would not recommend coming here with a large party... I had reservations for 11 ppl.  We were seated with only two menu's on the table. We all shared the menu as we waited patiently to order. After 35 minutes of waiting, I got up and asked for water and to order our food.  Each time, I had to get up and ask for extra napkins, forks, an extra bowl, water, soda..it was the one of the worst dining experiences I have had. Lastly, our dishes came out one by one, within a 10-15 minute time frame. We got our main dishes first, and then again, I had to get up and ask for the rice. Thank goodness the food was great, otherwise, I would have been really bummed! Overall, the food was flavorful and great.  My top choices would be the fried chicken and lemon chicken.  However, the complete disregard for my table, the terrible service was just too much to bare. When we finally got the check,  I was surprised that a 15% gratuity was automatically included. I went to the owner and told her that I had no problem paying for our food, but I would absolutely not pay tip for such terrible service. All she said was "okay". Next time, if there will be a next time for me, I will order to go as oppose to sit down dinner.

Came for dinner on a Thursday night during busy hours and was surprised that there were very few people waiting. A lot of people get take out and I would probably recommend it if you can take the food to go. Even though we were seated within 15-20 mins, it took about half an hour to get our food after we were seated, so in total almost 45 minutes from when we entered the restaurant and started eating. The kitchen is constantly churning out dishes and there are a ton of servers around but there's just a lot of orders they have to fill, plus the take out orders, so getting your food takes awhile. We had the dry friend chicken wings, pork pot stickers, string beans, some rice, and the free chinese kimchee they serve. Chicken wings definitely lived up to their hype! Honestly don't think chicken wings can get much better. Pot stickers have deepfried skin and they're very big, not as good as traditional pot stickers imo. And the string beans were great, and the portion was big. The kimchee is pretty spicy too as a warning! Overall, spent about $30 for two and we had some food to go. Great food, just a bit of a wait! Oh and FYI they don't do reservations for tables less than 6.

When I come here, I don't even look at the menu anymore...I just order their original dry fried chicken and peanut noodles, which comes out to roughly $20. The black bean sauce noodles are delicious too. One time, I decided to be daringgg and order one extra dish lol. The scallops! They turned out to be okay. But if you compare anything to the chicken and peanut noodles, everything's just okay... Anyway, just stick with the best - dry fried chicken and peanut noodles - and never be disappointed! Tip: Get here early because the line's always hella long during lunch and dinner.

No wonder why they're known for their world famous dried fried chicken wings. If you step inside the restaurant, every table, big or small, has at least a plate of those delicious wings. My boyfriend was on a trip visiting San Francisco a couple of weeks ago, and our local friends told us that it was a must to get their chicken wings. So we were able to make it at 9:25PM, just right before it closes, and got our name onto the waiting list. And boy were we so glad we had made it time! We also had their chow mien noodles and asparagus soup, which went great with our wings' side dish. Highly recommend this place, and cannot wait to return here on my next visit!

I was a bit leery about trying this place and like others have said, I was also wondering how authentic and "truly Chinese" this place was.  I've gone a few times now and I noticed there's always a lot of ABC's, Filipinos, and other non-Asians there.  Not sure if that's a good sign or not.  I never see very many FOB's there.  But Filipinos know their Chinese food, right???  Also, whenever a place gives out fortune cookies at the end of your meal, that's also not a very good sign!  This is also one of the very few Chinese places that actually still use the old paper take-out boxes, instead of the usual styrofoam boxes.   But for the most part, the food is pretty legit there.  I tried the infamous chicken wings that everybody orders, and they're pretty good.  I don't know if they're to die for, but they're good.  But this dish definitely reminds me of something that non-Chinese like to order at a Chinese restaurant.  Kind of like eating orange chicken or kung pao chicken or sweet and sour chicken or General Chow's chicken or slippery shrimp at a Chinese restaurant.  The string beans were pretty good too.  We also got some potstickers and for $7, they were the biggest potstickers I've ever seen.  The steamed pork dumplings were nothing special though.  I haven't really tried too many other dishes, but will be back.   And of course, since it's Frisco, parking is horrible!!

The place was super busy, but the turnover was pretty good. But it doesn't matter, because like most others, we went there for the dry-fried chicken wings. And they were as fantastic as everyone has said. I'm sold. Everything else we ordered was just okay - the string beans were nothing to write home about, and the combination chow mein didn't really have much of a combination going on. A few pieces of shrimp, beef and maybe chicken scattered about. Overall, 5 stars for the chicken wings, which count triply. 3 stars for everything else.

I've changed so many lives by taking friends here. Out of town friends hate me because they can't get it every day. Tips: Have your order READY- this is not a time wasting restaurant. Order the dry fry chicken. Flag down your waiter if you need something- they won't check on you. That being said, prepare to wait a long time if you come during lunch/dinner time, especially on weekends. Or just weekends in general.

I should have ordered the wings, but the kung pao chicken was calling my name. I should have ignored the call. The staff looked like they were Chinese but a German must have slipped into the kitchen judging from my meal. How else could one explain a sauce that looked & tasted more like a gravy you would see on an entree in a German restaurant. I am still looking for good kung pao chicken in a town full of Chinese restaurants.

WHAT TO ORDER: - Dry fried Chicken Wings: crispy skin with tender juicy meat, covered in a sweet and sticky sauce. (Save for rice!!) - Dry fried Fish fillet: cooked like the chicken wings, but replace with deep friend fish fillets. Pleasantly surprised by the size of the order. Plus! - Sauteed String Beans - Pork Dumplings - Dry Black Bean Sauce Noodles - Three Deluxe Spicy Sauce Noodles **If there is a HUGE line, walk next door to NEXT DOOR SWEETS. Contrary to their sign which advertises only a couple of San Tung's dishes, they do serve the ENTIRE MENU. However, you just don't have that restaurant atmosphere... CONS: -parking is a bitch -kinda pricey -usually a long waiting list

Believe the hype, the chicken is so good. Also the dumplings are a big hit. Well worth the wait on busy nights. I suggest coming in around 3:30 -- you'll get seated right away versus coming in at 6:30 for dinner -- which could take up to an hour of wait --eek! But they do a pretty good job of cleaning the tables pretty fast to seat the next person. Makes me wonder tho, why not extend their restaurant? Oh yeah, and i usually dont like chow mein, but i'll eat theirs anyday!

After seeing 3000+ reviews, my friends and I were ready to try the best chicken wings in town. The wait was about 1.5hours on a thursday night.  We looked around to see what people mostly ordered and we copied them :) Wet chicken wings - the sauce is on the sweet side. The combination may have been hoisin sauce, white pepper, black pepper, honey, plum sauce? Dry chicken wings - these were my favorite! They were very nicely fried. A bite on the chicken was crispy and oily-salty when you eat the edge of the skin. But this one is even sweeter than the wet wings. Maybe it's the sugar that gives it such a delicious oily crunch. The sauce is thicker too...molasses? Stir-fried string beans - I think adding pickled vegetable gives a nice salty crunch to the vegetables, but the dish didn't taste great here. It was sweet! It was also in the fryer too long, which made it greasy and somewhat wilty. Wet black bean sauce w/ homemade noodles - I think the dish tastes better than QQ Noodles' because it wasn't too salty. I guess the sugar helped. :) But I wish there was less sauce. Pork/napa cabbage dumplings - ok; the skin was too soft (maybe overcooked?) Sizzing rice soup - This was one of my favorite - on par with the chicken wings. I had never tried this before. The broth was light, and I liked the peas and mushrooms in it. The sizzling rice adds a nice light crunch to the soup. Next time I want to try fried fish!

The wait is too long so be prepared to wait if you want to eat here.  We originally planned on eating at the restaurant but the waiting list was so long that we decided to do take out.  They told us take out would only be 20-30 minutes but we ended up waiting an hour.  The food is decent, I did not get to try the famous chicken wings but the other dishes we ordered were just decent and not worth the wait.

Went next door to "Next Door Sweets" where there was no wait. Full menu offered, don't be skeptical. They started doing this a couple months ago. San Tung owner's son owns Next Door Sweets, so the recipes are the exact same. You might not get the San Tung chinese restaurant ambiance, but you do get closer access to PMT and gelato. It smells uber sweet inside, I felt like I was going to get a cavity from sniffing the air. Worth skipping the wait at San Tung though! Black bean sauce noodles were alright. Seems like more people enjoy the dry black bean noodles, but we weren't feeling dry that night. Hot and sour soup was good. Not your typical hot and sour soup flavor, so it's flavorful in its own way. Not super spicy or sour. Could use a different type of mushroom though. Dried sauteed string beans are always a favorite. It was cooked well here, so try it! Last but not least, dried fried chicken. Yes it was gooooood, nice and crispy. Would definitely come back if I am in the area.

I don't get the hype of this place. The chicken wings that everyone craved for were just...I don't know, feels like the General Tsao of chicken wings to me (i.e. American-ized). It was very sweet, only a bit spicy, and nothing else. The meat wasn't flavorful and the mediocre sauce did not help. I think we also got some appetizers and maybe a noodle dish, and I could remember was: mediocre Chinese food. It's not American-Chinese per se, but I don't feel like it's authentic either. Well, maybe I'm not from San Tung, but I've been to San Tung, and I did remember liking the food there. So there you have it. Overhyped, over-yelped semi-Chinese food, is what I call this place. If you want real homey Chinese food with a hometown feel, go to Don Bei Mama. Now that place knocked my socks off!

As other reviewers have said, the Chicken Wings are the BEST. Now that Mayflower is closed, came for dim sum which was pretty good except for the panfried potstickers which were deep fried. Yuck.

Alright, let's get the obvious out of the way - the chicken is good. Crazy good. Worth the wait good. Stood outside in the cold SF summer just for this. However, I do have to say that though the quality of the chicken is great, the sauce is not as unique as one may think. The rest of the dishes were good. String beans are delicious and recommended. The dumplings are nice - but not up to par. Surprisingly, the hot and sour soup was really really good, and this is coming from someone who isn't normally partial to it. Definitely worth it if you have been waiting in the dead cold of summer. 2 orders of dried fried chicken. string beans. dumplings. hot and sour soup. rice = $50 between 3 people. Street parking, both free and metered.

I remember my very first visit here it took about 30 mins to get a table,but afterwards I fell in love with their CHICKEN WINGS!!!!! I'd recommend a party of 2-4 people for easier seating, but it generally depends on a first come first serve basis so be patient if you come with a bigger party of 6 or more for table availability. The wings here is by far the best I've had in San Francisco. It is fried to perfection and still tastes moist when you bite into it (be careful cause it's really hot!) and then evenly coated in a sweet and savory sauce!!! I've been back to this place many times and I always order the wings, it's super delicious and even addicting. I also like their steamed pork dumplings and the black bean sauce noodles!! The dumplings are comparable to mom's homemade dumplings. I've tried their peanut sauce noodles, seafood noodle soup, and black bean sauce noodle. As the name implies the peanut sauce has a prominent peanut taste and a bit sweet. The seafood noodle soup is too bland, so I like the black bean sauce most because it's savory and less sweet tasting. Overall, the food here is good and service is good so the four stars is well deserved!! :-)

I've been here a couple of times and we always order the chicken wings. I usually hate wings but I'd order it every time! The rest of the food is pretty good too. You have to get here around when it opens during weekends or you'll be waiting for a table for at least an hour!

Like every other review says, you can't go wrong with San Tung dry fried chicken wings.  They are freakin delicious and I love chicken wings.  The wait here is always long though, so we usually just place our order over the phone and pick it up to eat at home.  Parking around here sucks too, especially during dinner time.

Always crowded, and of course, the wings are what to come for as copiously detailed.  Most of the other fare here is OK to good - we are still exploring the menu but haven't found anything quite close to those wings. But, wings along generally pull us in and rope in family and friends as well.

Dry-fried chicken wings. They are as good as everyone says they are. 1. #3 on SF's 7x7 Big Eat 2012 - http://www.7x7.com/eat-d… 2. On my list to take visitors not from SF 3. On my list for best SF foods 4. My friends from far away crave the dry fried chicken wings and want to come to SF JUST for it 5. ALWAYS packed, no matter what day of the week 6. CHINESE people eating at a CHINESE restaurant So technically, this place should get 6 stars. Granted, there will be a long wait, like at least an hour, so subtract a star for that. But it's worth it. Wow, an hour wait for food and it's still worth it? I wish I was that special =P

Came for the black bean sauce noodles (No. 7), stayed for the chicken wings.  The wings were pretty amazing - sweet, savory, spicy, crunchy, and succulent. The noodles were nothing special, really.  A bowl was enough to share between two people, but the flavor was unremarkable and the house-made noodles felt like regular yee mein noodles used everywhere (except longer).

I drove all the way for 2.5 hrs to end up with a nice dinner at San Tung. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. My friends told me there were two types of Chicken Wings, wet and dry. I can tell you that I think the dry is probably slightly better. The meat was a decent amount, but basically anyone eating this is just for the sauce. We also had string beans, basicaly the same sauce. They basically make everything with slight variation of this sauce. The sauce differences seems to be how much sugar they add, but I'm not 100% sure. For four people, we ordered 3 plates, and we had about 4-5 pieces left over with 3 hungry dudes. We also tried the potsticker. I would probably pass on that. So if you want chicken, come. If you want anything else, I have no idea because I never tried it :) Btw, the hours on Friday are terrible (close at 9:30 sharp), They told people to leave who just showed up 2 minutes late. ouch. Guess when you own  the best chicken in town, you can do whatever you want.

Sad to say that this place was a complete disappointment from the moment I arrived to the moment I left. I wanted to take my parents out to eat somewhere that they actually like for once since everytime we go out to eat, we always end up eating something I want to eat so we decided to go for Chinese food. I call before I arrived to make sure that it wasn't too busy. The waiter that picked up the phone had poor english but I'm not grading them on that because well, it's a Chinese restaurant so it's expected. He said it wasn't too busy so we headed over. When we got there, there were no tables available. We told the waiter that we called earlier and all he kept saying was "I TOLD YOU, I TOLD YOU I DONT KNOW WHEN IT WILL BE BUSY." Uhh...WTF? I never said you didn't. So we put our name down and waited about 10 minutes before we finally got our seats. We arrived like 15 minutes before the specials were over and asked if we can still order from it. The first waiter said, "okay let me ask my boss." A few seconds later(literally) his boss came and asked to take our order. Uhh how about give us a minute to actually look at the menu? It was like they wanted to rush us out ASAP even though there were no other customers waiting. 2 minutes later, he came back and asked if we were ready to order in a rude and annoyed way. 30 seconds later, they asked us to move to another table and at this point, I was pretty fed up. No food in the world could make up for the attitude and service that this place has given us. We ordered as quick as possible and ate as quick as possible because we just didn't want to deal with crap service. Ordered the dried chicken wings and to be honest, they weren't even all that great. I've definitely had better wings at Lee Hou Restaurant on Clement when they were still open. Mediocre Chinese food + absolutely the worst service I've ever had = 0 stars. Apparently I can only give 1 star at the very minimum and that's exactly what they're getting. Definitely WOULD NOT be back. Cash/Credit Card Accepted.

the chicken wings were ok. i thought maybe if it was spicy, it would've been better.  i definitely wouldn't wait for that.   the black bean noodle was nothing special. and the shrimp and leek dumplings were also nothing special. i actually did like their cabbage kimchi. i think they forgot about our order. first the sizzling rice soup (which btw, did not sizzle because it wasn't pipping hot. it was warm, at best) came after 20 minutes of ordering.  then the dumplings shortly after. we finished the dumplings, and i felt like it took another 20 minutes to flag the waiter down to ask about the rest of our dishes.   finally the noodles and chicken came.  I think they forgot about our order, because others who came in after us, got their dishes before us. one of the workers seemed reluctant to give me  bowls to split the noodles in.  He thought i could use those small chinese rice bowls.??! Anyway, i was very underwhelmed by this place.  maybe because Korean Chinese restaurants are a dime a dozen in LA.

Beyond the Great Plains and over the Rocky Mountains there exists a place so mythical and cloaked in overflowing lines that only few have made it there and braved the wait. However, those elite who persevered can speak to the glory and grandeur of Chicken Mountain. Once you start with one order of dry fried chicken wings at San Tung you can't stop there - you have to keep going back for more. They are so tasty, flavorful, crispy on the outside, moist on the inside and served with a sticky, thick, sweet sauce and Szechuan chilies that have just the right dose of mouth-numbing heat. After you've conquered enough plates and built your pile of bones sky high, your waiter - who I'm sure has this down pat - may come over and proclaim "You build Chicken Mountain!!" At this point you will know you have attained enlightenment and a serene, content, numb feeling will wash over you (it might just be that you're full and overloaded on chilies, but I'm going with enlightenment). The chicken wings are definitely the stand-out dish at San Tung, but everything else I've tried is solid. The sizzling rice soup - it's my favorite and I'm so, so happy to see it all over San Francisco; I can't get it in New York - was great and served five and the potstickers, which are fried, are enormous - at least twice as big as most - and filled with juicy, porky goodness. The beef chow mein was par for the course, but we also rounded out our meal with a couple other dishes. The dried sauteed string beans were very good; packed with great garlic and ginger flavors, a decent dose of heat and soft enough to bite right through. The black bean sauce noodles has a different flavor profile from most of the other dishes on the menu, but still deserves most of the praise it gets. The dish, which is packed full of seafood, is made with fermented black beans and then heavily thickened, probably with cornstarch. To some this dulls the plate's flavors, and I would have liked a little heat in the dish to spice it up, but I see it as being very comforting in its own way. The chicken wings are food hall of fame, five-star quality, and the rest of the food is in between three and four stars, so I'm settling on four. The wait can be kind of ridiculous - my recent trip on a random Tuesday night left my friends and me stranded outside for well over an hour - but so long as you know what you're in for it's worth it. Prices are fair for the amount of food you get. My only complaint - and this doesn't affect my review - is why on earth are they closed on Wednesdays?! That's the day of the week I previously wanted to go! Sacrifices to gods of Chicken Mountain - the greatest kind or the best kind?

Pretty much the best Chinese food I have had. First good sign: It's 2pm on a Saturday and the place is PACKED with Chinese families eating. Second good sign: First dish comes out quick - it's dry-fried green beans and they are like crack. These people make vegetables taste like crack. That requires skill. And we seal the deal with the dry-fried chicken. We got it served "wet" and the cubes of chicken instead of wings. Just fantastic and addictive. So yeah, it was worth the wait in line (20 minutes or so), the tight space up front where all the waiting people sit, and the Chinese couple who tried to cut in front of us in line. Good thing the manager pointed to the white board (DON'T forget to write your name and number in your party there when you walk in!!!) and put them in their place.

San Tung never disappoints. I have been a die-hard fan for years, keeping their menu and phone number on my desk for quick access. After coming here for 7+ years I have never actually sat down and eaten in the restaurant. So my review does not incorporate that perspective... After moving back into the city after leaving for 5 years, I find San Tung to be very much the same, in a good way. Their portions are very generous, their staff are orderly and efficient, and I believe this establishment is a predominantly family-owned business (gotta love that). Their dried fried chicken diced is a must have if you go to San Tung. I find the portions to be bigger in dried friend chicken diced vs dried fried chicken wings. The wings are crisper however. There is also a choice of getting the order "wet". However I haven't ordered the wings in a while, but I remember I don't prefer them. Call your order in for takeout if you want quick service. They usually have your order for take out ready in 15-20 minutes. And if I'm not mistaken they deliver! There is always a wait for a table (thus why I've never sat down in the restaurant before) and the wait times have ranged from 20-45 minutes. Insider's tip: the father of the business decided to create a business right next door to San Tung. They offer ice cream and sweet treats AND they share a kitchen with San Tung!  So if you want to order something off either menu, you can eat them at the adjacent "sweet" restaurant. I've never been, but it's on my to do list now that I'm back!

I first tried the famous dry fried wings a few years ago...and left with an unmemorable meal. I tried it again recently, this time just ordering the wings for take out... and oh my gosh it was amazing. I stand by giving things a second chance! How do the wings stay so crispy?? We took it home and ate it maybe 30-45 minutes later, and it was still hot, crispy, sweet, tangy & sooo delicious. A week later and back home in L.A..... I was craving it so badly I was determined to find a recipe online & make some for myself (Not an exact duplicate but quite successful if I may say so myself!) I have a new love and appreciation for these wings and can no longer envision a visit to the city without them. To-Go of course. Wait time looks horrible and messy. Service looks. sounds. worse. $10+change for an order of wings. Credit Cards accepted.

Finally got to try the infamous chicken wings! Make sure you order them dry style (but they're quite the opposite - moist, yummy and with this gooey spicy/sweet sauce). One order is enough to feed 2-3 people... Also, the cold noodles were really good too. Peanut flavored and making me drool thinking about them... Service is not too great and slow. Chicken wings took several minutes after we got our noodles... but it's ok - you're here for the food!

We did take out from this super super popular Chinese so it may have dampened the food a bit. Of course, we ordered the "dry" chicken wings.  In fact, 5 orders of it!  Not really "dry" since it does have a sweet & savory sauce over it.  I'm sure the "dry" refers to the way it is cooked, which literally means "dry stir fry," and that loosely means, fried, then frying in the wok again.  By the time we got it, the skin wasn't really that crispy anymore thanks to steam but it was still good.  Next time, gotta go there and try the wings fresh! Ordered a few types of dumplings.  Pork & Chive was definitely my favorite.  The Pork & Cabbage had a nice subtly sweetness from the cabbage. We also got a huge order of the String beans, which is always a favorite dish of mine at Chinese restaurants.  At San Tung, it has a noticeably sweeter flavor to it.  There's also a good amount of preserved mustard tuber! Now, there were a few items that I felt was just meh, probably due to the fact that it was take out though.  The combo fried rice was not that great since it was a bit cold.  They packed the sauces for our black bean sauce noodle and sesame noodle separate so it wouldn't be a soggy.  I didn't care much for the sesame noodles though.  The black bean sauce, aka zhajiangmian, was a little different than the typical ones I've had.  Not bad though. Glad I finally got to try San Tung, although after the meal, I have decided that I must check out the place for myself to really see if I liked the place or not.  While it is convenient that we did take out to skip the long wait, the long drive back from one end of the city to the other probably cooled the food down so it's not as enjoyable!

A packed restaurant/ No seats to wait around so you just kind of have to stand there until they call your name. The must try here are definitely THE WINGS. the consistency of them are amazing!   I didnt really try anything else here except for the black bean noodles which the server recommended and I didnt really like it because it was sort of bland and the noodles were a bit hard. but other than that.. THE WINGS.

YUM. The wings here are amazing, and nobody I have brought here has ever thought otherwise. As for the rest of the menu...meh. Don't even bother with the potstickers. The cherry pork was far too fatty, and this is coming from a pork belly lover. Unfortunately I have not tried their black bean noodles which I always see being shuffled over to every table in the room. Luckily, an order of the wings is enough to fill 2 people up. Do try their semi-sister restaurant, SO, which is apparently owned by the son of the owner of San Tung. The wings are equally good but addictive in a different way. At San Tung, you want to scoop up all of the deliciously sweet, honey sauce that accompanies the dry fried chicken. At SO, the added heat to the wings keeps you coming back for more.

Go with the original chicken...need I say more? Fine...the dry noodles with black bean sauce isn't too bad either.   Just be sure to come ready to wait.  We did the ole' ghetto route - order to go and eat wings in the car.  Still a 20 minute wait, but at least it's faster. Went back to the car.  We got a few honks since we weren't giving up our parking space.  But don't try to interrupt me when I AM EATING!! Just DON'T DO IT! I AM NOT MOVING until the goodness is in my stomach, SAFE AND SOUND!

Famous wings. MMMMM. At first our party of 5 wanted 3 plates of wings and 2 other plates, but our waiter kinda upsold us and told us to buy more food... weird.  But I guess we were bigger looking dudes.  Anyways, the wait is worth it if you've never tried it.  The wings are the crispiest things ever and are covered in a ginger/soy/sweet/spicy sauce that is really gluey and sticky.  Really good.   The other food though is pretty subpar to any asian restaurant, so that's why it's a four instead of a five.  Additionally, some of the staff can be a bit rude, but it's an asian restaurant so what can you expect.

San Tung has decent Chinese food, but their real star is the dry fried chicken wings. I promise it lives up to the hype; it really is that good. The first time I had it I thought I would only eat one or two because I was already stuffed from lunch (this was a mid-afternoon snack!), but I ended up eating four or five. The fact that every table has at least one plate of this (if not two!) speaks for itself, right? I've also sat down in the restaurant for lunch (I think the lines are always horrendously long, so either come prepared to wait or don't coming during peak hours), and my favorites were the dumplings and string beans. I haven't had a bad dish here. I don't know if it's my favorite Chinese restaurant (there are slight variations in Chinese food and I prefer Szechuan because I like my food spicy!) but it's classic, comforting food that brings back happy childhood memories. :)

What is the HYPE?? I don't get it! The Chicken is average, very Americanized taste (more like sweet & sour chicken wing).   Green bean was undercooked and greasy, dumplings were....Frozen super market quality. Man, too bad Izakaya Sozai closed during my visit or else I would never be here.

Came in around 5pm and we were seated immediately. We started off with the shrimp and leek dumplings,12 bites of delicious goodness. The dumplings were steaming as I bit into it, and I knew it would have been better to wait for it to cool down a bit, but I just couldn't resist. I ended up with a burnt tongue. Black bean noodles is seriously so large you'll need two people to finish it. I shared it with my girlfriend and we could barely finish the noodles after the 12 dumplings. The fact we were eating dinner so early probably made me fill up faster. This meal was worth every penny we spent. Fast service and good food what more can you ask for. We were quite satisfied and out the door within 35 minutes.

Favorite dishes: #1: Dry noodles with black bean sauce and seafood. Elegantly prepared, not too overwhelming. Great seafood. Great vegetables. A very good dish. #2: The dumplings. Especially the shrimp & leek. They were very good. Almost rivaling Din Tai Fung. Almost I said, because there are no juicy pork dumplings :-). #3: The chicken wings. Dry original. So good! But the dry noodles were my favorite! So many good choices. The menu is a palace of good choices. Honorable mentions: #1 Pork with black mushrooms. This had good seasoning and the mushrooms were wonderful. However, the sauce was a little overthickened and the pork was a little overtenderized or something. #2: The kimchi at the beginning! served immediately. Man it's good! The spice is perfect somehow! #3: Green beans, I can't remember which style they were, but they were fantastically fresh and crispy and tasty. These would have been a top dish if they came near the beginning, middle, or end of the meal! The organization of the place is haphazard. I know people say to expect this when going to a Chinese restaurant. However, my experience is that things only arrive as they did here in dim sum places where you can never find the right cart. For example... we got the green beans after everything on the table was consumed and the rice even came late and that was gone with all the drippings/sauces from the previously eaten dishes. So in retrospect, it was a lot of fun. The food was great. The value is fantastic! It's very affordable and given it's class of preparation, I'd say it's an extraordinarily good value. The kids loved the food. The table was perfect. The service for water, tea, kimchi was FAST! The staff / servers were very nice.

Amazing Asian chicken wings and all around the Chinese food here is some of the best SF has to offer. That said, the wait can be incredibly long (1 hour or more) which makes you question whether it is actually worth it. If you can manage to get there when there is a saner waiting period, then you're in for a real treat.

The deep fried chicken was SPECTACULAR! I have never tasted anything like these wings and will probably never find any like them anywhere else in the world. They were so so very good. I want some wings just as I am thinking about them. Another dish that I really love was the hot and sour soup. I only tried the soup at those chinese buffets which I thought could never get better. I was wrong. The hot and sour soup here is my number one favorite at the moment. We had a few miscommunications with our waiters so don't expect the greatest service. In the end, food was fantastic and that's all that really matters to me.

The food: The reason there are crowds of hungry, disgruntled San Franciscans lining up outside is seriously because of the food. So far I've tried the many mentioned deep fried chicken wings (you can order it dry with separate sauce as well). Other highlights include the hot and sour soup, spinach and bean threads (which resemble glass noodles), mushu pork, and the potstickers. I've also seen a lot of people order heavily sauced noodle dishes (zha jiang mian?...lol can you tell I'm ABC). The good: The food really is superb. A chef friend explained that although "San Tung" is named after a region in China, there are korean influences on the food as well; hence the kimchi served as a small appetizer. The bad: I've noticed in my first couple of times that service was very noticeably slower for people who were not regulars. My sister and I sat and kind of stared sadly at the tables around us- seated after we were- get platters of food BEFORE we did. This is rather disgruntling, but with SF's small neighborhood feel I guess it's understandable. Ambiance: noisy Chinese restaurant What to know: become a regular to get better service. I wouldn't say the entire menu is spectacular, but you really have to know what to order. And of course, get here before you're hungry because there will usually be a wait. Good for: anybody and anyone In short: San Tung isn't spectacular on service, but the food is worth the wait and everything!

While visiting one of my friends in San Francisco, who happens to be a San Franciscan native, her family took me to this place. She and my other friends kept HYPING about how amazingly delicious this place is. Apparently, they claim that the chicken wings here are TO DIE FOR! I'm a pescatarian (which means I only eat dairy and seafood products), and I don't regret being one. But, this is probably the one time where my limited diet actually prevents me from enjoying a restaurant's specialty. Nevertheless, I was able to enjoy other food on their menu (although I can't say for sure if it's as good as the chicken wings). FOOD, FOOD, FOOD +As I stated before, I didn't try their chicken wings. But, once the chicken wings arrived at our table, everyone fell silent and started indulging on this plate of deliciousness. My friends devoured those chicken wings like a zombie devouring their prey, and just like that...those wings were gone in a blink of an eye. Judging from that, I'd say those chicken wings are beyond OMFG tasty...they're ADDICTIVE! Hmmm...makes me wonder what their secret ingredient is. +I did try their Dry Noodles sautéed in Black Bean Sauce. The black bean sauce has this thick and sticky texture to it. But, once you get past that, the flavor was wonderfully delicious. I highly recommend that. +I also highly recommend the shrimp and leek dumplings. This deliciously plump and juicy ball of amazingness will make you ask for more. +Warning: I sense that the main theme here is that their food is HIGHLY ADDICTIVE. So, beware of potentially becoming a food addict here (especially their chicken wings) SERVICE I've only been here once (on a weekend during lunch). But, from my one time experience, it seems like this place is always SUPER CROWDED! We waited 15-20 minutes before we were seated. Their customer service isn't spectacular, but it's expected from an Asian restaurant (especially if it's really packed). Our waitress wasn't particularly attentive; it seemed like she only wanted to take our order and get the food out to us without conversing with us too much (and she didn't come back often to check on us either). I highly doubt any of their customers really come here for their customer service; they mostly come for the food. So, where they lack in customer service, their food will more than make up for it. PARKING Like most restaurants in San Francisco, this place is located on a busy street with limited parking. There are metered-parking spaces near the restaurant, but those are taken up really quickly. If you go a bit further down, there are non-metered parking spaces (but I believe those are "timed" parking spaces). Looking for a parking space around here is frustrating, but with a little bit of patience you'll eventually find one (it may not be your ideal space, but you'll find one).

So I went to spend a weekend with some friends in SF. When I get there I am told we are going to have wings for dinner and that they are to die for. If you read anyone else's review, yeah you will see that too. So we show up at this literal itty bitty Chinese joint in the sunset about 8:30-8:45ish and its standing room only OUTSIDE! Well we finally get into this joint and we made the cutoff, yeah if you show up after about 9:15 you will be turned away. We watched it happen. Also they may run out of some of the food items. PRO TIP: BRING YO JACKET FOO. You will need it while waiting outside. So yeah back to the ughhh WANGS!!!  Dayem these were crispy and crunchy and chickeny and totally different from any that I had had before. Make sure you get the dry wings as they are fully basted and dripping. I cant fathom what the wet wings look like! We also got two other items: the Garlic Green Beans (super tasty and yummy) and the Noodles with Peanut Sauce. Yeah I cringed over peanut sauce covered noodles also... I was thinking this will be absolutely nasty. So when I bit into it, I was totally surprised. It was basically Chinese Satay noodles with seafood mixed in. My friend ate all the scallops and mushrooms (yeah I know I know I'm not a fungai eh?) and I had all the shrimpies! BUT wow this stuff was decadent and went real well with the wings and green beans. PRO TIP: Drop off a passenger while you find parking to get your name on the list. It will save you a good 15-20 minutes waiting in line at least. Definitely the weirdest food I have ever had together at a Chinese restaurant, but DAYEMZ that grub was tasty. Then again since I hadn't eaten anything but a Costco Polish dog all day, I coulda just been hungry. Regardless, this stuff was awesome. The service was a lil curt (cept for the guy in glasses who directs people to tables). Otherwise yeah this place is too small and should try to expand (unless they like having 20 people milling around in front all day and night long). I definitely want to go back though ASAP. Wow it was good.

Dry fried chicken wings -- that's all I have to say. ...but I'll give this review a bit more substance. Unless you're really impatient, don't let the crowd of people outside scare you off. It's well worth the wait! Also ordered both the cold noodles and the black bean sauce noodles too, which can definitely be shared among a group of people. Besides, you wouldn't want to fill up on noodles when you have plates and plates of chicken to gorge on, right? But really, dry fried chicken wings. Mmm...

This is one of my favorite Northern Chinese styled restaurants in the Bay Area, but I don't come here for their mediocre Chinese food but their fantastic dumplings and noodles that use their signature dough. When you first set foot into the restaurant, you are most often greeted by an unpleasant odor of carpet cleaner....and dry eraser markers? You quickly glass at an intimidating white board full of crossed out names and realize they're 8 parties of 8 people each in front of you. So you put your name on the board. Wait for an hour, wondering why you even decided to come here in the first place, and then some horribly abrupt waiter sits you down and speaks to you in some broken English even when you are responding to him in Chinese. Well, that's the typical experience at San Tung--really unpleasant until you get the food. I say that the discomfort makes the experience that much more memorable. When my family and I come here, we normally get their pork dumplings, shrimp dumplings, steamed pot stickers (not that fried crap), their dry spiced chicken, and black bean noodles. Each one of the dishes is good enough to outweigh all the unpleasantry that preceded the food. Their dumplings are flavorful, soupy, and are encased in their divine dough. Their noodles are equally awesome because of the dough and is drenched in a pretty good black bean sauce. As everyone rightfully says, their chicken wings and drums are great. Though I can't express the same accolades for the rest of their menu. I think this restaurant should be judged on a different criteria than other restaurants in the city. This place puts its emphasis on their signature dishes, nothing else. You're going to get bad service, unless the heavyset owner is your waiter. You're going to laugh at first when they ask you to sit down with another family because they're out of room, and then realize that they were being serious. You're going to hate their decor and their bathrooms especially. In the end, however, you're going to love the food, and at least I think that makes up for everything.

CRACK WINGSSS!! so good. probably as good as the chicken wings i have had in new york! The place is small and the wait is long (but totally worth it). We use to come here a lot when we were growing up but since its gotten really popular, we haven't really been back until now! The wings were super good and cooked to perfection. The shrimp and leek dumplings were juicy and delicious. The sizzling rice soup was okay.. and the green beans were perfect!! Definitely recommend you coming here if you love chicken wings like I do...!! *TIP: They take reservations if you have a party over 6 so its definitely in your best interest to do so!

Been hearing about this place for a while since I moved to SF and I finally went with some friends of mine over the summer.  It def lives up to the hype! we all got an order of the spicy seafood noodle soup (not sure what it's really called..), and shared some of the dumplings, and of course the wings! The soup was exceptional. I absolutely loved it, one of the best I've ever had and it was enough for 2 people definitely (even had leftovers). the dumplings were known to be really good.. but I'm not impressed, probably because I'm not a big fan of dumplings in general.  Now the wings. holy hell.. the portions were so big, it stayed crispy and hot even though we kinda let it sit while we ate our noodles + gossiped for the entire meal lol it was really good and definitely lived up to its hype! the only thing is, this place is pretty pricey for being on irving.  There's better choices along Irving for other entrees definitely but this place is worth it just for their wings.

The San Tung wings are the only things in my recent memory that have bypassed my hatred of eating with MY HANDS. Their sticky, garlicky, sweet/tangy, crunchy chicken is well worth a trip to the bathroom sink. I saw someone take a whole bunch of these to go, which seems like a great idea. Having some sort of TV marathon with these wings + bottomless pitchers of beer seems like a good time. The walnut prawns are crunchy and savory, but I tasted a little too much mayo. The same dish at Great China in Berkeley tasted lighter/better. The wait can be annoying, and you may have some linecutters, too (I'm talkin' to you, "RAINIA"). Write your name down on the whiteboard as soon as you arrive!

First of all- DO NOT COME AT 6PM ON A WEEKEND. I had a party of 6 and we ended up being #35 or something on the waiting list- nuh uh. Second of all- if you don't like loud places, please choose take-out. The restaurant is cramped and the noise level, due to all the young patrons, is LOUD. Despite the hour and a half wait though, the chicken wangs made it all worth it! The dry chicken wings HIT. THE. SPOT. We had both the boneless ones and the regular ones, and both were fried to perfection. The sauce was so good that some of us poured it on our rice. And do not fear, if you're a vegetarian! We had two vegetarians in our party and we all ended up sharing the delicious string beans and eggplant. And THIS is why Panda Express will never be considered real asian food...!

Unsure why I have not written a review for this MAJESTIC PLACE. It's pretty much going to sound like all the other reviews: THE CHICKEN WAS BOMB DOT COM. NEVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE IT. WILL PROBABLY NEVER EAT ANYTHING LIKE THIS AGAIN. DRY SUGAR COATED CRACK IS WHAT IT IS. The black bean noodle reminded me of authentic Chinese food in northern China, where my mom's from, aka it hits home from me. I could eat it for eternity. Green beans. Have never loved a vegetable like so. Also coated with some form of an addictive (safe) drug). Dumplings. Shrimp and leek. Fresh and delicious. And if you're wondering if 2 people can eat all of the above, the answer is yes. Get as much as you can. Leftovers have a half life, don't taste as good, but still, but still. Drawback is there always a wait at popular hours. It's fine. It's worth it. It's not as long as you think. Hover over eating patrons while you wait. Salivate at the sight of the chicken wings. I've never creeped a table WITHOUT the chicken wings. If you go and don't get the chicken wings, you are crazy. Ok, do you get my point? You have to try this at least once.

I heard so many great things about San Tung and was super excited to try it. We ordered take out which probably was not the best idea. Wings are meant to be eaten on the spot which they are fresh and still crispy. We ordered: Veggies #107: healthy, not very memorable Chicken wings #74 and 75: one order of the wet and one order of the dry. They were good, but I have to go back and try them there to give a fair review. Noodles w peanut sauce #11: just ok, very heavy Beef w black mushroom: ok String beans #113: good Shrimp fried rice #128: average Sizzling rice soup #31: pretty good, healthy Broccoli chicken #68: average

Flew back home into the SF airport and wanted to grab a bite before the drive back to Sacramento! My hubby read up on on the review on Yelp and it seem like everyone's recommendation were their fried chicken! So we arrive there circling the block a few times hoping to find a good parking spot. Took us merely 30 minutes to find parking 2 blocks down from the restaurant. We walk into literally a mad house full of people!! Absolutely NO vacant seats available and crowds of people standing around waiting to be seated. Considering we just flew in and were a bit tired, we didn't want to wait and decided to take our order for to-go. We had to squeeze our way through to the back of the restaurant where their register was located. Hoping to be serviced immediately, we had to stand for a good 10 minutes because every waiter and waitress were too busy going in and out of the kitchen with plates full of chicken in their hands!! Finally after having to flag down a waiter numerous of times, someone was kind enough to stop and help us. We ordered 2 plates of chicken; one dry which is basically fried chicken and the other with their house sauce mixed in. To be honest? These wings weren't finger licking good or to die for in my opinion. We didn't know what all the hype was about! Perhaps we had better fried chicken at Sandra Dee's in Sacramento? Well whatever it is, we weren't too impressed. The dry fried chicken was good but it didn't seem like they used some sort of special house batter to deep fry with to give it that extra goodness. The fried chicken with the sauce was mediocre. The sauce was sweet and it did get a bit messy in the car! I have learned that day that I prefer my fried chicken without any sauces smothered on top. All in all, I probably would come back to try out other dishes here if I'm ever in the vicinity. But I definitely won't go out of my ways to come back!

There's two things I always get when I come here: 1) Dried fried chicken wings: pretty much everyone that has reviewed San tung has ordered this which means you must get this. What separates theses wings from other places is definitely the sauce they use. There's the wet and dried version of this dish but pretty much tastes the same. I like eating this with rice. 2) Black bean sauce noodles: this noodle dish is great! It has a lot of flavor so I like to pair this with dumplings(: *Expect to wait an hour when it is dinner time. I wish the restaurant was bigger so customers won't need to wait as long. **Order take out to avoid the crazy wait :)

Did I order the wrong chicken wings? Got the "wet" fried chicken and apparently the "wet" string beans as well. It's better than most places but it's not something that I crave. The chicken was saucy and the flavor was good but not spicy as I had thought. The string beans were flavored with garlic and soy sauce but too soggy. Also got some dumplings which were actually pretty good and big portions too! The skin was soft and the filling was just enough. Got it to go because the wait on a Sunday night was going to be about 1.5 to 2 hours. I don't even know how the wait list works. Better be willing to wait if you want to go. We had to wait 30 minutes for our food. Then we had to give them an extra 10. Don't know if it was worth it or not.

Floured in crack, seasoned with meth, their chicken wings are sooo addicting!!! OK, they're not floured in crack, etc etc, but yes, I'd drive all the way from the east bay to sunset just for the wings. I love their signature dry fried chicken wings here. I don't know what it is about these wings, but they are totally worth coming here for.  I can't comment on the other items on the menu because we never order anything else. I don't even care what other menu items there are.  What else can I say?   Oh, super busy during lunch, then starts getting busy again around 3-4. Come by, eat lots, lets get fat together!

San Tung was the only restaurant I visited in SF that actually exceeded my expectations.  The dried fried wings were amazing, they were honey garlic glazed crispy chicken wings cooked to perfection.  12 wings per order.   Great value for the money.  If you visit SF San Tung is a must visit.

Been going to the San Tung circa 1992 when it was small hole-in-the wall restaurant  off 24th Ave. Still enjoy the nice rich dumplings Shrimp and Chive or Pork. This place is not your typical Chinese joint, but more Chinese/Korean cross cultural fushion thus the Black Bean Sauce Noodles (Jajang Myung) Spicy Noodles (Jampong) Tang Su Yuk (Sweat and Sour beef/bork brown sauce) Cabbage kimchi and finally the infamous Dry Fried Chicken (Kampoongi) I find the best way to order is pick-up.  Call, order, wait 20min pick it up and avoid the long, long, long lines. For those of you who crave Dried Fried Chicken, you can always go to SO's off Bryant owned by the other brother. :)

After seeing the raving reviews of over 2000+ customers...we had to try this place. It is legit. Cut the BS and go straight for the wings. They are no joke. The dried chicken wings are spiced with ginger, sugar, garlic and some other magical rub that just make this so addicting. Its got a light crispiness to it that just makes it even better. We also ordered the dumplings and fried rice which I could care less for. Just give me the chicken with beer and I'm set. Expect to sleep after. Hint: go next door if you want to skip the ridiculous line...they serve the same food plus dessert.

Besides the ridiculously long waits and original dry fried chicken (get the whole chicken not the pre-cut ones), there exist other wonders that this place has to offer. first off, the dry black bean sauce noodles are a must, don't even question this, your stomach can thank me later. second, get a bowl of rice! it's $1.50 per bowl but it's a must since it compliments the chicken so well (the chicken is very sauced up) third, repeat #1 and #2... and enjoy. highly recommended for food, not for the long wait or the cramped interior

I came here on a good day, parking wasn't terrible, and the wait wasn't too long. (Until we sat down that is!) We ordered the: 1) Fried chicken wings - These chicken wings are as good as everyone claims! Not spicy but a bit on the sweet side. However, the chicken was very crispy despite being drenched in sauce. 2) Green string beans - Very well seasoned! A great compliment to the chicken wings. 3) Vegetarian dumpings - Unfortunately the dumplings were just so-so. It was pretty bland. 4 STARS

OMG....everything we had was delicious!! We had the dry fried chicken wings, garlic chicken, dry fried string beans and rice.  We couldn't stop eating until it was all gone!  Prices were cheap.  Quite a bit of food.   CON:  Super crowded, waiting in line.  We got a table for 8, but had a party for 5. We ended up sharing our table, just to fill it up. Street parking is the only parking available.  So, be prepared to drive around looking for spot.

Chicken wings are great, service was ok. The string beans are also good. I didn't care for their xiao long bao too much.

I was here this evening as a suggestion from a friend from work.  This has been on my "must try" list for a while and it did not disappoint. The 5 of us ordered 2 orders of wings, veggie pot stickers, pork dumplings, green beans, and garlic spinach.  The wings were amazing, I could have eaten another order all by myself, the spinach was also amazing - nice and garlicky and very tender. The veggie pot stickers were ginormous, and MOLTEN hot (I would like to try them in a "porkier" format) The pork dumplings were good, but this gal likes her dumplings FRIED (please).  The beans were also a winner. I spied duck at another table and would like to try it. The noodles at yet another table looked gloppy and not so good. I want to go back ASAP, there was a wait when we got there but we were in within 15 minutes, so not bad at all. Bonus points fro a fairly clean ladies room (by chinese food restaurant standards). it was $15/per person including a slightly generous tip.  nice price.

DRY-FRIED CHICKEN. I was originally going to give this place 4 stars because the other dishes we ordered that day were so forgettable. But then I realized that since that fateful day, whenever I get hungry, all I can think about are their crispy and crunchy on the outside, moist and flavorful on the inside, delicious dry-fried chicken, which are drenched ever-so-lovingly with a succulent, sweet and savory, sticky honey-like, crack-laced glaze. It was so incredibly addicting that I wanted to lick the plate clean once they were all gone (but pride and self-control got in the way). The next time (and there WILL be a next time) I visit, methinks I shall simply order multiple plates of dry-fried chicken.

After the Nike Women Marathon, couple friends and I went to try out their chicken and trust me after running 13.3 grueling miles, the chicken was worthhhhhhh it. (It would have tasted well There is a tea place right next door so you can even get a drink and wait, but it was not too bad.

I really want to give this place 5 stars, but I just can't. Though its chicken wings are AMAZING, some of their dishes aren't. The chicken wings are alway so tender and juicy inside, covered with that sweet and spicy sauce on the outside. It makes you want to pour all that leftover sauce on the plate onto your rice so you can finish it all up. It's THAT good. I don't know how they make it so heavenly, but I have yet to find that place that can beat San Tung. I also like their spicy seafood noodles (warning: it's spicy!), and their green beans :) Yum. On the other hand, some dishes were not that memorable, such as their mushu wraps. I also didn't find their dumplings to be that great, if I wanted dumplings in the Sunset , I would just go to Kingdom of Dumplings on Taraval. But if you go, you MUST try its famous chicken wings, you will NOT regret it, trust me :)

Fellow Yelper Fia R and I visited this popular Shandong restaurant after spending the morning walking around Golden Gate Park. For the longest time I had stayed away from San Tung after hearing about their poor service, but decided to find out in person as several Yelpers alluded to their Dry Fried Chicken Wings as something too good to pass up. The décor was antiquated with a home-style ambiance and packed with a huge crowd from front to the kitchen in the back. The wait was suggested at 45 minutes during our visit, but in reality it took a lot longer than that. Interested diners should look for a clipboard hanging by the door, sign up, and wait inside as the server only calls for the next table for those in the area to hear it. If you decide to wait outside you might be out of luck by the time you come back to check on the wait list. Their menu consists of Shandong cuisine that also included a listing of Chinese-Korean items such as Liang Zhang Pi, Spicy Seafood Noodles, Jiajang Myung, and etc. They gave us a side dish of Kimchi from the start, followed by the order of Shrimp and Leek Dumplings ($7.50), Dry Sautéed String Beans ($8), and Original Dry Fried Chicken Wings ($9.50). The boiled Shrimp and Leek Dumplings were not very good. The wrapper was too thin, lacked texture, and the fillings were dry and bland. I wished I had read Tan's review prior to this visit: http://eat.tanspace.com/…. I don't recommend it. Their Sautéed String Beans were fried to dry to my liking. It could use a bit more flavoring but the texture was on point and fresh. The String Beans were accompanied with garlic sauce and diced Chinese pickle. I wished they could wok fry this dish longer as the flavors were layered instead of fully integrated into the String Beans. The overall taste was decent, but Kingdom of Dumplings can make them better and they are not too far away. Many reviewers gave 5 star ratings based upon their Original Dry Fried Chicken Wings alone and I can understand why. The Wings were crispy, spicy, garlicky, sugary coated and fried to dry. The Wings had a mix of textures and depths. It was very good by all measures. I missed out on some interesting dishes so I would absolutely return to give them a try. This includes Tea Smoked Duck, Hot Braised Chicken, and their Chinese-Korean items. Servers were oddly all male and their attitudes were straight-laced and not friendly. Overall, I still believe this is one of the restaurants that are worth visiting in San Francisco given the uniqueness of their Wings. Good, but somewhat overhyped. Not yet a fan, 3.5 stars for the overall experience.

This place is really hyped up. My whole family came here for my bros graduation. We took up two of those round tables. We tried almost everything on the menu ...everything came with a thick sweet sauce! geezuz! We did try the chicken wings, yes, they were good but I would have liked it with out the sauce. The chicken fried rice as ALRIGHT. The string beans, ALRIGHT. We ordered a bunch of other stuff that I can't quite remember because well, it just wasnt that amazing for me. I dunno, wasn't too impressed at all and its usually pretty easy to please me. I also asked if they had beef chow fun and they don't serve that ... *sad face*

Interesting dish that I tried: black bean noodles with seafood? It was actually pretty good and something different. I really enjoyed it! But please, if you haven't done so, try the wings. If you like it, great, you can come back, if not...well at least you tried it and can check that off your SF foods to try bucket list.

I think when things are hyped up, you end up getting let down.  That being said, I've had their dry wings numerous times and they are good.  But are they mind blowing?  No.  Best thing I ever ate?  Probably not.  Would I come out of my way to have them? No, not really.  My friend does like coming here to have the black bean noodles, but I'm not a huge fan of them.  It's more of a Korean Chinese dish than a Chinese dish. If I want authentic Chinese food, this would not be my first choice, but if my someone's craving Korean Chinese food, I'd definitely recommend this place for their Black Bean Noodles and Chicken Wings.

Mentioned in over 1600 reviews, one has to think to oneself, how good are these darn chicken wings?   My answer after trying them, absolutely friggin' delicious!  Perfect combination of sweet, sour, and crunch.  The only thing I'd add is a little more kick but other than that, amazing.   I sat down at a table near the kitchen and seriously, they have to have a station just dedicated to making these things.  In my 45 minutes there, I must have counted at least 20 orders of their Original Dry Fried Chicken wings pushing through the kitchen.  If you're in the area go to San Tung for the wings, you won't be disappointed.

Everyone raves about the dry fried chicken wings here. I guess they're good -- if you've never lived in or been to NY and had the korean fried chicken -- see NYT article here: http://www.nytimes.com/2…; also can check out Kyochon, Bonchon, UFC among others). I got super excited thinking it was that kind of new wave chicken wing, but it ended up just being the regular chicken that comes in all Chinese-Korean fusion restaurants (kan poon gi) Don't get me wrong - the chicken is not inedible. It's fine. Two-dimensional at best. It's slightly spicy + garlicky, so they're on the right track. The skin texture leaves much to be desired as it's thick and not enough of the fat is rendered. I was hoping for a thin but crispier type of skin. The spinach with bean threads was heavenly. I would come here again just for that.

I finally came here after their remodeling closure and I really don't get what's all the hubbub is about. I came for lunch with some friends before noon and so we beat the famous lines. My friends have eaten the food here before and told me its good. I was excited to try their famous chicken, some of their black bean noodles and the potstickers. The food was very pricey in my opinion. The chicken $9.50, arrived first and there were only 12 pieces! I was a little shocked to see how little you get. I wondered how different the portion size is if you order the chicken but from the lunch menu. The chicken was honey glazed and crisp and don't get me wrong, they smelled delicious! I just didn't get what all the hype is about. Tasted like regular honey glazed chicken for me....the black bean noodles came second which is also $9.50, was surprisingly tiny also. The noodles came in a small bowl. I mixed the noodles and tried them. I think eating the instant packs from Korean supermarkets taste a lot better. Finally the potstickers came. My friend ordered it fried because it supposedly tastes better. There were only six potstickers! I think the dish was $3.50? but I don't remember. The stickers were tasteless to me even after saucing them with hot sauce and some soy sauce. I don't think I would become a regular here. It gets full very quickly if you don't get there early and I honestly don't think the wait is worth it.

Don't be fooled and order their WET Fried Chicken. That was my mistake the very first time I came and went home cursing for how soggy the chicken was and how Yelp lied to me. Year's later, I dared to return and ordered the Dry Fried Chicken after a friend set me straight... and damn... it is finger-licking, sticky-icky goooooood! I don't remember too much about their other food other than it was not worth the ridiculous wait (definitely not the best chinese food). Order take-out unless you want to wait 2 hours for a table. Took off 1 star because no matter how good their chicken is, the wait time scares me enough so that I don't come back too often.

This is definitely a place to eat in you're in SF, if you don't, you are totally missing out on these crazy wings.  The sauce is amazing, the wings are fried just right.  I don't think I can eat at any other wings establishment ever again, its San Tung or die. A dish of the original dry wings are 9.50.

3.5 stars? It was pretty tasty...and yes I did try their very populate dry fried chicken which my friends and I were all very eager and hyped up to try. They were light, crispy and had a nice soy sauce type coating- kind of reminded of kyochon chicken. Would I come back for this? maybe? maybe...... Some other things I tried: their peanut sauce noodles- interesting. pretty good....but olily. Something good to try...but not something to go cray for. Being it our 1st time there, we weren't sure what to get...but it turned out that we ended up getting everything "DRY FRIED". we got the DRY FRIED CALAMARI, DRY FRIED SHRIMP. and we had like 2 orders of some of them....guess it was the way to go LULZ. The calamari and squid was delicious and there was a generous portion of it. Since I came with a big group in time for dinner rush hour...we made a smart decision by calling ahead and making reservations. and boy are we glad we did! We arrived around 8:30pm and sure enough there was a huge crowd waiting outside...and inside....on a tuesday night......and literally walked in and sat down. WHADDDAPPP SUCKASSSS haha so now u know. if u gots a big group, pick up the phone and call ahead. not sure if they will take reservations w/ small groups though....it worth a try!

The other thing we got like the dumpling is a major Pass...the skin was soggy n the meat was blah...the hand made noodles was unexpectedly addictive but the black bean sauce was quite bland...save the stomach space and just go with the chicken wings n drown the rice in the sauce... and u got yourself a great yet simple meal.

YES! YES! YES!...to their amazing dry-fried chicken wings! I am such a chicken wing aficionado that my bar was set pretty high. However, their chicken wings did not disappoint at all. For $9.50, they'll give you a healthy plate full of some of the most succulent wings I've ever had in my life. Of course they only have their one flavor but don't let that deter you. You should realize that the sauce adds so much to their wings and they prepare it in a way that the wings don't get soggy from the sauce. That may be due to the fact that this salty-sweet sauce is more of a glaze than an actual sauce. Anyway, no matter what you come here for, always order a plate of wings. As for the rest of our meal, it was your typical Chinese fare but with slightly more flavor and more finesse. If you look in the back, the kitchen consists of a dozen or so men who are all Chinese. That makes this food pretty legit in my opinion. The rest of our meal consisted of white rice, sizzling rice soup, and chicken with black mushrooms. All the dishes were excellent. Prepare for a wait. Wear a jacket or coat as you will mostly likely have to be waiting outside. If you're smart, you'd just call in for pick up and just eat your food at home. Once you get to the restaurant, make sure to put your name on the whiteboard to the right of the doors when you walk in.

Never trust yelp that much cause it always tend to be over hyped but boy was I wrong this time. THE WINGS ARE AMAZING!

The chicken wing, my dear god the chicken wing...do I need to say more?  for 6 people, we ordered 3 servings of it.  I would had been happy to have just the sauce and rice.  Be sure to let the chicken rest a few minutes to allow the sauce to crystallize, then dig in. The bill ran us $70, which is not for how good the food was.  We didn't have to wait, so that was a bonus. CHICKEN CHICKEN CHICKEN!!! What are you waiting for? GOOOOOOOOOOOoo 4 stars. Enjoy

We got there on a Saturday night, and of course there was a huuuuuge line outside, and tons of people just waiting for their names to be called.  We had a large group, and we were waiting in line, but then we decided that it was taking too long, and that we were just going to order take-out.   All we wanted were the wings, so we got a couple orders and took them to my friend's house in that area.  These wings were spicy (for me, the weakling), BUT soooo worth it.  Super juicy and the flavors were AWESOME.  I would definitely burn my mouth again for more of these.   I wish I could say my review was for all of the food there, but seeing as the wings were the only thing we got, it is purely for the wings.  And that's it.  But really... that's all you need to know anyway.

This used to be my family's go to place for dinner. But oh my gosh we hate the wait and we hate finding parking around there. Go early or drop someone off to put a name down while you go park. My family and I finally visited it again after months, and we ordered our usual.   Dry Fried Chicken Wings--Sweet and salty, sticky and dry, crunchy and tender, these chicken wings have a combination of flavors that will fit any palette. The sauce is sweet and peppery, I'm still trying to figure out what's in it because it's super addictive. It'll taste good with anything! Dan Dan Noodle--It's very peanut-buttery and spicy at the same time. The noodle is chewy and there are bits and pieces of seafood and cucumber in it. The sauce is super thick and gooey, which is frustrating trying to mix it with the noodle, but once it's well mixed, gosh, it's yummy. Pork with Mustard Green Noodle Soup--They give you very generous amount of mustard green and shredded pork. I love this noodle soup. It's very comforting and not overly salty, so that it doesn't make me thirsty afterward. The noodle is chewy! Pork Dumplings--These dumplings are very poofy and meaty. It's a little bland, but nothing their soy sauce with hot chilly oil can't fix. The service is just okay. It takes awhile to get their attention but overall pretty decent. Some of the items are on a pricer side, but the portion is pretty big.

Dry fried chicken wings were awesome! They look like they'll be wet and sticky, but they're dry to the touch and very tasty. Yummm... Didn't get a chance to try the dry black bean noodle - next time. The other dishes we ordered were standard Chinese, nothing remarkable. We got there early on a weekend - maybe about 5:30ish? It was just my fiance and I, so our wait was fairly short. But we did see the line get long after us, so plan accordingly.

I started dancing in my chair when I took my first bite. Super tasty! But even better than the wings... the BLACK BEAN NOODLES.

If you get anything from here, make it the dry chicken wings! They are SO amazingly good! We came here around lunch time on a weekday and the place was packed, we had to wait a good 20 minutes to be seated. Service was typical especially since it was busy. We also got the black bean noodle dish and the won-tons which were alright, nothing too special. The wings though...melt in your mouth deliciousness. The perfect blend of seasonings and sauce.

Came here for my second time and I am still not impressed. Service was terrible. I don't expect great service at chinese restaurants but this place really sucked. Our water was never filled even after we asked them. They brought the appetizer after our entree. The mongolian beef lacks any flavor. The pot stickers were just deep fried and also lacked any flavor. The food here seems to be pretty bland in general. My moms broccoli chicken had the same problem. If the service was better I would bump them up to a 3 star review cause this place is average.

Like a trip to Hong Kong, and yes the wings are awesome, but come out hot and wet but cool to wonderful goowey. Perfect balance of salt, sweet and spicy! We did not love the black bean noodles, the shrimp and scallion dumplings were loved by me but not by him. We thought the Beef and Broccoli had nice wok haye, and wished we had the hot and sour soup. Great experience, immaculately clean from dining room, to staff and visible kitchen. Go early, order heavy and take home the spoils.

It was 9:00pm, I was exhausted and walking to my car after Outsidelands, and there San Tung stood, like a beacon of light in the dense Sunset District fog. The food was sufficient, but not mind-blowing. I'm pretty impressed by the fact that the restaurant has over +2800 reviews....must be all the fellow asians in SF yelping. Wait was only 10 minutes which was nice, but I was still surprised by how packed it was since it was after 9pm on a Sunday. I knew that the dishes to get were the chicken wings, the black bean noodles, and some dumplings, but I wasn't in the mood for any of those things! And what about the other dishes?! Shouldn't they get some lovin' too?! Shouldn't I try to be a little more adventurous then exclusively relying on what yelpers tell me I should get? In the end, I tried the kung pao chicken, the mapo tofu, and the dried sauteed string beans. Kung Pao chicken is missable, the mapo tofu is pretty good, and the string beans were the best! flavorful and savory veggies, what's not to like! The portions are large, the prices are good, and chinese food always make the best leftovers. Do skip the kimchi they bring to you in the beginning. It was disgusting and I really believe ours was sitting out all day. As for paying, don't try to pay with 2+ credit cards unless you hit the $25 minimum per card. Alas, I will be back! Must try the chicken wings....

The chicken is too sweet.  The green beans were okay.  The spicy cabbage appetizer was not flavorful.

5 stars for the dry fried chicken wings. SWEET. CRISPY. DELECTABLE.  The sweet sauce is really sticky like honey, which helps the wings stay crisp. The dry crispy texture of San Tung's wings can't be beat! As for the rest of the food, it was definitely good, but not mind numbingly awesome like the chicken wings. We had the Hot and sour soup, black bean sauce noodles and the honey walnut prawns. The hot and sour soup was great, had a little spicy kick to it, and had lots of ingredients to it (tofu, sea cucumber, shrimp, etc).  I like hot and sour soups with a lot of substance. The black bean sauce noodles were good, but nothing to rave about. Pretty standard in my opinion. The honey walnut prawns were good, but definitely gluttonous. Think of fried prawns covered in sweet honey mayo Tip #1: Eat your wings there, don't take leftovers. Microwaving them will make them soggy. Tip #2: Prepare for long waits around dinner time especially on weekends. Avoid by ordering take out or coming early.

First of all. when i first heard about this place my brother was hyping it so much. so me and my family came here and once we arrived to the restaurant we saw a HUGE line. but good thing we reserved, so we didnt have to wait, once we were sat we got some kimchi ( weird having a korean food at a Chinese restaurant  ) but regardless it was delicious and SPICY. We ordered Shrimp&Chive Dumplings and Pork Cabbage Potstickers to start, they both were AMAZINGLY tasty. the shirmps were huge and plump and bursting with flavor while the pork potstickers were crispy on the outside and moist on hte inside. finally the DRY CHICKEN CAME. Oh my God, this chicken was on a next level of flavor and awesomeness, too awesome to describe you must TRY. mouthgasm. * BTW,  i've been here many times before now, just thought i do a review on my first experience here. * Ps. every time i come the food is amazing.

Came here for the chicken wings, was not disappointed. From the outside, I thought this would be a "Korean-Chinese" place. It says "San-Dong-Ban-Jum" in Korean on the outside. But San Tung was not like the typical Korean-Chinese joints I was used to. We got the famous chicken wings (I think this is Ggan-Poong chicken in korean, but its usually made with cubed chicken) dry. Dry doesn't mean there's no sauce on it, so go ahead and order these if you want glazed sauce on the outside. The skin was perfectly crisp, and the glaze was sweet and savory. I saw other people order the black noodles that is a staple at Korean-Chinese joints. They also looked different from what I was used to. I assumed this place is more heavily Chinese, although I cannot say for sure since I am not Chinese. They were just..different from the Jja Jang Myung I was used to seeing, and also different from the Chinese zha jiang mien I've eaten numerous times. I'm wondering if it's like a SF-Korean-Chinese thing... Anyways, no matter what the influences are, the food was delicious. Those chicken wings are definitely worth a try.

Some of the best Chinese food I've ever had. My suggestions: vegetarian mushu platter and the dry fried chicken wings. Both were absolutely heavenly. The service sucked major ____, but you know what, that's par for the course with hole-in-the-wall places with amazing food. Just expect it. That's all.

The hype is right. San Tung = DRY FRIED CHICKEN WINGS. After almost a year of living in the Sunset, I've finally tried their amazing chicken wings. Why did I wait so long?!? San Tung's got it down. The wings are juicy, tender, tangy, spicy and addicting. The wait for a table is a little ridiculous, so unless you luck out on timing, I'd recommend ordering it to-go. And with just one visit I'm officially hooked... I'll be back soon!

What to say about San Tung that hasn't been said before?   Obviously, if you're coming here, you're coming here for one thing.  The chicken wings.  Quick fried, then drenched in a msg laden mix of sticky goodness, these things are to die for.  I could probably eat them once a week or something a long those lines and still be happy.  The other food is all very mediocre chinese food.  You eat it as fillers to go along with your fried chicken.  The chicken is the one thing you come here for and not much else. Parking can be a pain in the behind, but park a couple blocks down near St. Annes and there should be plenty of parking there, walk a little.  The wait can be long but I've always come with K on a weekday around 6-630 pm and I've never had to wait for a seat.  The tables are close to each other, you might end up eating with strangers but that's part of eating Chinese food.  Don't be intimidated as pretty much all the waiters speak English, it's blown up that much on Yelp that they've basically needed to learn English. If you really want to, on my last visit, I noticed that the dessert place next door serves the Chicken wings also as a snack (I found out the place is owned by the same owner of San Tung) so you can sneak  in there to eat the Chicken wings if the wait is too long in the actual restaurant. Go for the Chicken wings, don't expect much from anything else.  But the wings are so good, they earn a 4 stars all on their own.

All I have to say  is that they have the best chicken wings ever. The wings just have so many different flavors that goes together. It a very unique, sweet, salty, savory taste. I don't know how else to explain it. Also I had the Black Bean sauce Noodle which was also very good. All in all, there will be a wait, especially during dinner time and on weekends. Also, just stick with the chicken wings! Everything else is mediocre.

This place is sooo awesome. San Tung is a Chinese province near Korea, so you get a bit of both worlds. San Tung is famous for noodles/dumplings/buns and is where my ancestors are from. All my life I've always been particularly fond of noodles and dumplings, think it's in my blood. San Tung is home of the famous dry fried chicken and was the sole reason for our journey to the inner sunset area on this trip. These wings are le-gen-da-ry and was definitely worth the drive, however the jang pong aka tsao mah mein aka spicy seafood noodle soup totally stole the show for me. These noodles were top notch and amongst the best I've had. The dumplings aren't too shabby either. San Tung is definitely worth the visit if you're into cheap delicious eats. If you're a snob for service and decor as a requirement for a great restaurant, don't bother, this place is not for you. I can't wait to go back again.

I haven't had their famous chicken wings. I will say that jjajangmyun and jjambong are a favorite amongst Koreans. When you order one you want the other so quite a few jjajangmyun places allow you to order what they call the "jjajjambong" which is a bowl that is divided in half (so dishes won't mix) and one side contains the jjajjangmyun (black bean noodle dish) and the other half has jjambong (spicy noodle soup). You always want one when you have the other. Always. Uhhhh so San Tung doesn't have that option, but their jjambong was yummy. Was it out of this world amazing jjambong? No. I wish there were more noodles. There was a lot of veggies. hahahhaha (I know,  I know), but I did! I really wished there were more noodles. Service was exactly what I expected, just good enough.

The ratings do not lie! I've been going here for over 10 years and this restaurant never disappoints. The dry fried chicken wings are definitely a winner and popular dish here.  With just the right amount of sweet and salty, many other restaurants try to imitate it but san tung still reigns supreme. Other dishes I order regularly are the pork dumplings, 5 spice beef noodle soup, and san tung noodles. Definitely go early if you plan to go here for dinner on the weekend, it gets crowded.

4 stars overall? seriously? this place deserves 5 and a half stars! Everything here is good; obviously I haven't had the opportunity to try everything on the menu, but from experience I can guarantee you that everything on the menu will be delicious. my family and I have come here NUMEROUS times (Dinner is alwayssss packed and you need to put your name on a whiteboard near the door). You are served kimchi (not very good) and tea when you are seated while u wait for your food. My family and I always get the pork dumplings (Yes!), some kind of vegetable with pork and tofu dish  and DRY FRIED CHICKEN WINGS. that is what the restaurant is all about. must get this. Everyone I know thats every been to the restaurant always orders at least two servings of the dry fried chicken wings - you can not be satisfied with just one order once you bite into that sweet, crunchy delicious mix. :]

lunch with high school friends: rc siblings, ap, hk, ml, jw, jz, cl, px, and there was also sl reservations made this wasn't our first choice but so many places were closed on new years eve. even before the food arrived everything seemed rather dirty. there was chunks of residue on my plate. a chunk of something on the inside of one of the bowls that i saw sitting 2 feet away. i asked for the spoon to get switched. there was some red powder stuck on the outside of the tea cup. i didn't eat much. everything was rather saucy and the sauces were oil based except for a few items. fried chicken wings wet: - this has more gravy sauce - the fatty part of the wing had to be disposed of onto my plate instead of swallowed fried chicken wings dry: - crispier and less fatty feeling - just the right amount of sweetness seafood noodle soup: - super long noodles that got super messy - shrimp was over cooked 1 bathroom for the girls and 1 for the boys. it didn't smell and was fairly clean.

Probably the best Chinese restaurant in the city.  The dry fried wings, black bean noodles, leek dumplings, sweet and sour beef, and spicy seafood noodle are all hits.  Place fills quickly, and the staff works quick to try and get people in and out.  Parking sucks in this area of the city.  If you order to-go, it can be as fast as 15-20 minutes or as long as 40 minutes.

I heard so many people kept telling me how great this place is. However, from the country where I'm from, if you don't have capacity of handling pick-up, it would be better just concentrating to provide better dinning experience rather than trying to offer the so-called service. We were told to pick up our order in 30 mins, and we were left staying in line for another 30 mins w/o nobody even came up and talked to us. I don't believe the city full of thousand restaurants, there isn't a better place with better service. The food was OK. but after this drama, it made their food taste just worse than mediocre.

We went to try San Tung Chinese Restaurant because so many people love it on Yelp & it was named one of the top 50 Chinese restaurants in the Country.  I can't believe it. Ate a late lunch because we went to the DeYoung Museum first.  Got there about 12:30pm & there was a line Easter Sunday 4/8/12. Ordered a bunch of stuff for 3 people: FREE kimchi given right when we sat down - i liked it Shrimp & pork dumplings - 12 small dumplings steamed.  Tasted ok. Dry fried string beans - what's with the sweet goopy sauce?  Veggies shouldn't be sweet. Five spice beef noodle soup - Huge bowl of homemade noodles (we think), several beef pieces, some veggies.  I liked the noodles, beef was fine, just not enough, veggies average, soup base only tasted salt. Dry fried chicken wings- their famous dish, cousin loves it.  B. & I found it too sweet.  Comes w/ that same sweet goopy sauce as the string beans. Steamed rice Charged the meal about $41 before tip.   Separate bathrooms in the back.  They put the fortune cookies near the men's bathroom!

San Tung is the restaurant with the big crowd outside of it. That's how you find this place. There is enough room to fit in about 30 people and there's a special private room for larger parties. The wait was about 40 minutes during the dinner rush. The waiters will fill up tables with four people parties before they fill tables with two people. This place has one of the best chicken wings ever. This is a must try for anyone who comes here. The sauce they put on it is amazing. It's a bit sweet, but not too sweet. The wings are crispy with the right amount of sauce. The black bean noodles are pretty great also. I can't really say there wasn't anything I ate there that I didn't like.

Parking is a bit hard to find around this area unless you get lucky and either get a meter or parking around the residential area. Also, there is usually a line so you will put your name on the white board until they call your name to be seated. I'll cut it short. The dried fried chicken wings are the best!!! Get it dried not wet, because it is cooked to perfection. That's the best thing to get at San Tung. The dumplings aren't bad either. The restaurant hand makes the dumplings. The string beans are also tangy and crunchy, VERY delicious.

Everyone that I've ever taken to San Tung have become addicted to their original dry fried chicken wings. My cousin is flying back to Portland today with an order of chicken wings to take home to her husband. That's how insanely good their wings are. Besides the chicken wings, their hand made noodles are delicious. Go early to avoid the long ass wait list and be prepared for hit or miss service. If you don't want to deal with the long wait, go next door to the ice cream shop and order the chicken wings to go.

I don't get the hype and the subsequent enormous waits. Luckily I came with a party of nine so we were able to reserve a table but after having eight different dishes, I was not particularly impressed with any of them. We had the dried bean curd, mongolian beef, chive dumplings, fried rice, combination seafood, garlic eggplant, sauteed green beans, and the infamous chicken wings. Everything was your typical Chinese food that could be found at any restaurant and nothing left me grabbing for the last serving on the table. I also don't appreciate being rushed through the meal and out of the restaurant. I understand that it's busy but people are trying to enjoy their food, not scarf it down. I will admit that the chicken wings are good, but would I wait 1+ hours for them? No.

So the funny thing about a place that has one signature dish, (chicken wings) is that people fail to objectively review the restaurant's other food. or they just give a 5-star rating based on the one signature dish. Yes, the chicken wings are good-- crispy, sesame-flavored, sweet. Pretty good. definitely 5-stars for the chicken wings. Now, on with the rest of the food. I would say that this is slightly worse than the average good quality/ authentic chinese restaurant. their family style tofu was really bizarrely different from what you would normally get (keep in mind that this is a staple chinese dish)-- but still not half bad. we also got their dry fried string beans which was nicely fried, but on the sweet side-- its usually savory and a bit spicy. another thing--im a big asian sticky-rice fan. they don't serve sticky rice-- im pretty sure it was jasmine rice. that was a disappointment for me. other things were fine. they gave us a pot of tea and some kimchee (why kimchee? i dont know) when we were seated. food came out fast. service was typical for a chinese restaurant. final bit of annoyance here was that we called ahead to see how bad the wait was and they said it was about 15 minutes. we didnt want to wait an hour so we thought this would be okay. we arrived and saw there were 10 parties of 2-3 ppl ahead of us. we asked how long itd take and they said 20 minutes. after 30 minutes we asked again, they said 20 minutes. i think these guys always just say 20 minutes if anyone asks. we should have used our common sense, and realized the restaurant was popular and itd take an hour, but it was frustrating they didnt bother to give us the benefit of their experience to let us know how long itd take. we were quite hungry when we were finally seated. i would give this restaurant 3.5 stars-- i would have given them the benefit of the half star (ie 4 stars-- had they not given us a poor estimation of how long it'd take to be seated).

I had San Tung recently with my family and it was extremely busy, which is not a problem for good food. The wait was about 45mins, not too bad. I've been to San Tung several times and every time I come here I always order the same thing: Chicken Wings, Dumplings, String Beans, and a noddle dish and it always pretty good. But, this time it was extremely medico. The string beans were way too sweet, which my mom and dad thought so as well. The flavor of the string beans is the same flavor they use to the chicken wing, which works for the wings not so much the string beans. I wish the string beans has some spice or kick to it, it was quite medico. Overall, I will not stop coming here the food is still good, but there is nothing special about the food.

Food: 3/5-  Highly overrated.  I'm spoiled by the Chinese cuisine from Monterey Park/Alhambra area, so I was very disappointed by the food. Service: 3/5- Standard service.  It can be a bit slow and the wait can be long. Environment: 3/5- Standard no frills Chinese restaurant.  Feels very cramped. Value: 3/5- Decently priced, as most Chinese places tend to be. Return again?: No, not worth the wait.

Best chicken wings EVER! After a night of karaoke and drinking, we woke up hungry and craving chicken wings, so of course we had to come over to San Tung and continue my quest on finishing 7x7's 2012 Big Eats. We got very lucky because there was absolutely no line when we got there and were seated right away. Maybe 5 minutes after we were seated, a huge line was forming, so basically you have to test your luck when you come here on a weekend. If you decide to get one thing and one thing only, you have to get the fried chicken wings. If you are trying to stay neat and clean, you can get them diced, but I prefer the flavor of the ones on the bone. We've gone to SO for their chicken wings, and even though they are just about the same thing, I like the ones at San Tung more. The food and service are fast here, and the staff seems pretty patient since we were sharing a table with this pretty demanding and rude couple, and the staff just took it all. Make sure you prepare yourself for the madness that is finding parking in SF, and remember to be patient when waiting in line, because this place is definitely worth it!

It's an incredibly popular neighborhood Chinese restaurant with long lines even on weeknights, so you should come here really early. First thing you do when you come in is put your name on the wait list. If you are more familiar with southern Chinese cooking, you might be disappointed about this place. Northern cooking is a bit on the bland side. I ordered traditional northern fare: house-made dumplings and noodles. I thought they were just OK. The shrimp and leek dumplings were mildly flavored and is not better than mediocre Cantonese dimsum variant. Probably good for people with strict sodium restrictions. The other northern specialty, noodles with black bean paste was not bad; the hand-made noodles has excellent QQ (al dente) and the scallops were cooked well, but they're not out of this world. What this place is really famous for is the "dried friend chicken" which is not really "dry." It's deep-fried dry, then smothered with sweet garlic chili sauce. If it's spicy, I didn't feel the heat. It was really tasty (good Korean-style fried chicken, but with better sauce), but I wouldn't go out of my way just for them. Also, if that's all you want, you can skip the long lines by going to the next door dessert place (a sister restaurant), which sells something similar, along with bobba. If you don't like the line, check out Yummy Yummy next door. It's not an exact exchange, because Yummy Yummy is a Vietnamese crab place, but it's good eats with no line. People with allergies will probably have to order other things, like pho. Perhaps you might like this place better than me. It's not bad; you'd probably enjoy your meal if you order the fried chicken; but I would still prefer good southern Chinese food.

The food is good. I would give 4.5 stars for food. A little bit pricey. Everything we ordered was very good except for the steamed dumplings. Then why do I give only 1 star here? TOO MUCH MSG. I felt so uncomfortable while I was still eating my dinner. My body reacts only to TOO MUCH MSG. I didn't feel anything in most of the Chinese restaurants, both in Asia and SF. And my MSG INTOLERANCE experiences before never this bad. Sorry, San Tung Chinese Restaurant, never see you again. I want to live a longer life even though my taste buds liked you. If MSG not a problem for you, the food here is recommended.

Winner winner, chicken (wings?) dinner! With so many great reviews, I won't go into detail. All you need to know is you come here for the chicken wings. Simple as that. They also serve a comp. side of a Chinese spicy cabbage that goes perfectly well with the wings. Expect a line but know that it'll be worth your wait. You could always call the order in as well. One order is decent for two people to share but might as well order a few because they are just that good. This definitely hit the spot for me as a late night snack after being out at Nightlife across the street in Golden Gate Park.

I remember when my grandparents used to take my family here for lunch before the Yelp hype began--no waits, great service, excellent excellent food. Now, I'll be lucky to get in here without waiting for at least 20 minutes for lunch or dinner on a weekend. To let you know about the wait, my grandparents (who are elderly and have a hard time waiting around for food when their glycemic levels are low), no longer come here though my brother and I make the venture out just for those bomb chicken wings. We order to go usually because that's the easiest and, to be honest, the service is kind of lacking these days and I would rather not deal with the hustle and bustle of the restaurant. These chicken wings are my standard for all other chicken wings; nothing has ever gotten close to their tangy, salty, sweet glaze or fried perfection. I also usually order the black bean noodles and my parents enjoy the seafood noodle soup. Their noodles, I believe, are freshly made and have excellent texture and bite to them. Come out here if you don't mind waiting for a taste of delicious San Francisco Chinese-Korean fanfare.

*Chicken Wings Only* This was part of my last meal before starting my wedding diet. HOLY COW, or rather HOLY CHICKEN WINGS! The place is packed and it's for a good reason. I just went to pick up an order of chicken wings after one of my dearest foodie friends suggested it. Granted I had already stuffed myself with Pasquale's but it was my last meal day, so it had to be done. Every single table I saw coming in had the chicken wings on it. Clearly this is serious wing business. Needless to say they are scrumptious! It has that great tangy chicken wing taste with an Asian flare to it. Crispy, tender, moist and major flavor punch with every bite! Wing heaven people! After the wedding, we are coming here to chow down on the other food. It smelled and looked amazing as I stalked the tables. Can't wait!

I've been here twice, and all the previous reviews i read lived up to the hype. straight up. The second time i also got to try the flounder, which tasted just as good as the chicken in my opinion. This place is a must every time i visit SF, i love me some fried chicken! Food 5/5 Service was 4/5 The wait can be long, but if you don't feel like waiting, definitely check out the sweets place next door, they serve the fried chicken as well... along with red velvet cookies, cupcakes and cakes. so bomb.

ULTRA DELICIOUS chicken wings (crispy, sweet AND spicy!) and pork cabbage dumpling!!! I love their dumplings! I'll eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner, they are perfect. Can't help it, it's the Chinese in me... I will go back and try other dishes when I'm in the area.

My love for chicken still resides in San Francisco with SAN TUNG! They always have a long wait but boy is it worth it! Their infamous original dry chicken wings are so sweet and tangy. There are two types you can have it and I stick with dry. I've had the wet wings which comes with mushrooms and bamboo but it's not as good as the dry. Get a side of rice and thats all you really need. Don't be afraid to use your fingers and get dirty. Chicken wings are made to be finger food! Their steamed dumplings are super yummy! Pork and chives mmm... Now that I think of it, I need to make a trip to SF soon for my wing fix.

I finally went a few weeks ago to try and see what the hype is about. Waited 45 minutes, I mean not that bad except it was freezing outside -__- My friends and I ordered Shrimp and Chive Dumplings, Black Bean Sauce Noodles, and Dry Fried Chicken since it was the top choices on Yelp reviews. I don't know, I thought the Shrimp and Chive Dumplings were okay. It's not all that great, like others have mentioned, it wasn't juicy. It was alright. The Black Bean Sauce Noodles was my favorite though! The sauce was soooo good :) It was quite addicting. I swear I was still savoring the sauce till the end. So they say, the Dry Fried Chicken was up to its standard. It was really crispy and tender! It has a sticky candy sweet honey kinda taste, which differentiates it from other chicken I've tried and I like it! Nom! An advice I have though, DO NOT eat the chicken with the noodles because those two flavors DO NOT mesh well together. Trust. It's pretty weird. Service wise, they were really slow. I understand it was super crowded but still, service is service. I give them a 2.5 because my chicken took WAY too long to come out. I wish I wasn't already full from the other two dishes to completely enjoy the chicken because if I had to wait, my noodles would have gotten super cold. I would go here again though, probably on a weekday at lunch or something!

This place is OKAY!!! I tried four things on the menu my first time there. 10 minute wait on Thursday evening at 6:30PM. 1. Beef Broccoli - The meat was tender, maybe a little too tender for my liking. This dish was sub-par. There was a lot of sauce that the beef and broccoli was drowned in. I really don't have much to say about this other than the fact that it was mediocre at best. 2. Honey Walnut Prawns - I have mixed feelings about this dish. Prawns here fairly big, almost like JUMBO prawns. The taste of both the prawns and the walnut were fresh. My main concern with this dish is that there was way too much mayonnaise slathered on. I would try to wipe off some of it before taking a bite. 3. Pork Fried Rice - Again, nothing special. It was ordered as a medium for all of our dishes. I personally believe I can make better friend rice (and have been told I make really good friend rice). The thing I didn't like about this dish is that the rice is kind of soggy. It stuck together in large clumps and it was slightly bland. 4. Dry Fried Chicken Wings - I believe this was the best item I had that day. The chicken is good. Great if I were hungry. I liked how it came out crispy still even though it was super saucy. The flavor of the sauce is on point, sweet yet tangy...perhaps a mixture of X.O. sauce, sugar, honey, lemon...etc. It really isn't special but it was good nonetheless. Maybe I'm a little critical of this place because I'm Chinese and grew up eating a lot of Chinese food. Maybe it's because my dad was the head chef of a popular Chinese restaurant in Oakland Chinatown (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…). Or maybe I've simply had better. Albeit I didn't order a lot of the things people suggest, I ordered a lot of common, staple, Chinese dishes and was not left impressed.

You know... I really didn't want write this and give it a bad review but in the two years or so I feel like the quality and taste of the food here has gone downhill. A once well-loved and often frequented local Chinese restaurant turned tourist/money trap (seriously it was 80% tourists earlier today). Let the hating begin!!! Everyone raves about the dry fried chicken wings. Yes, true... back in the day we used to come here and eat the wings by the plate fulls. Anyone else noticed how the wings have gotten smaller and the dish way overpriced? Anyway... I hadn't had the wings in awhile but today.... OMG COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!! I read some recent reviews about the wings being too sweet and YES... wayyy sweet. They coat the wings in sugar and I guess because they are SOOOO busy making hundreds of orders a day, they can't wait for the sugar to melt or caramelize before serving it. The wings were crunchy, but not because of the deep fry... but because the sugar was still sugary!! This also used to be my fave place to get hot and sour soup. Today's soup was neither hot nor sour. Just a lil salty and starchy. But I was truly DISGUSTED by the shrimp in the soup. You can tell they used "old" shrimp... it was shriveled and dried up and tasted of chemicals. It had a bleach/pine sol taste. We took all the shrimp out of the soup as to not contaminate it further. (For really good hot and sour soup I would recommend Peking Restaurant on Noriega or Old Mandarin Islamic on Vicente.) Next we had this dish with sliced dried tofu, shredded pork and green and red peppers. When it came out it looked like a pile of brown leftovers covered by brown sauce. I was like "WHAT THE HECK IS THIS? FOOD?!" I was surprised at the crudeness with which the tofu and meat was cut. If you have had this dish before, the tofu and pork and sliced thinly and delicately. OH no... not today. Today it looked like it was cut by an ogre with a blunt ax. Some of the tofu and meat were in huge chunks and blocks while other pieces were thinly sliced and teeny tiny. Maybe it was leftovers.... (ugh) String beans... another old fave. Recipe and method of cooking now changed. Don't get it if you've had it in the past! They changed the sauce to a sugary sweet sauce and its no longer as tasty. It basically is cooked in the same sauce as the wings. When we asked the server what happened, he even said they changed the sauce. Boo!! (Strings beans at Old Mandarin Islamic are really good though!!) Black bean sauce noodles.... I never liked it here because the sauce is SUPER oily. But I also don't like that it tastes so "seafood-ey". It has something to do with the seafood they use... it is not fresh. For a restaurant so busy I am surprised they use such poor ingredients. Anyway, I now post this two star review. Hopefully it won't get deleted or pushed to the bottom of the pile. Sorry San Tung. I don't think I will return... But good for you.. you still got lines out the door so you must be doing something right. PS I was gonna give this review just one star but it got a +1 because I did like this place a lot in the past. (This is also the reason I decided not to call the health department about my concern for the bleached seafood. Cleaning agents are often used to mask the fact the seafood is old and going bad.)

ZOMFG!!! this place has awesome fried chicken!!! If you have had korean flavored fried chicken such as Bon Chon or Kyo Chon, you know sort of what to expect. it's not breaded much, if at all, and covered in delicious sweet garlicky goodness :) If you haven't had these types of chicken before, I strongly rec it! Also note worthy was the peanut noodles. It was something that I don't think you can get anywhere else and was also really good, it was a nice creamy sauce, a little on the sweet side, with the noodles that come in jja jjang mien. The string beans were also very good, but added to the wings, and the peanut noodles, the food ended up being a little too much on the sweet side. Just make sure you end up getting something a little saltier or sour to balance out the sweetness of the chicken.

Food: 4/5 Service (on the day we went): 1/5 My first time at San Tung was probably much like a lot of other peoples -- bustling, noisy, and very crowded. All signs of a great business and a good sign that this place would have some solid food. Me and my friends came during the middle of the week and waited outside for about 10 minutes or so before we were all there and were brought in. (Note: it is a good idea to get there a little bit before or after the midday lunch rush otherwise you may be waiting for quite a while). When we were inside we were seated in the back room, away from the main dining area and really nice because we had 5 people in our group and the table had a Lazy Susan so it was perfect for sharing our food. When our waiter took our order, we got pork dumplings, garlic chicken, black bean dry noodles, string bean beef, and two orders of dry friend chicken wings along with sides of rice and our drinks. Needless to say we had a pretty good size feast going -- the only problem was that the waiter NEVER came back once. After he took our order we literally didn't see him for the next 45 min/hour. I understand that it was busy, but there's no way you should completely forget about a party, especially when the door is open to the room and you're passing by it every 20 seconds to get to the kitchen. It wasn't too big of a deal until we got the check -- we noticed that he added tip to the tab which a) wasn't ever put on the menu, b) is usually done for parties of 6+ not 5, and c) wasn't even deserved in the first place. We noticed the mistake (never let a restaurant charge you for something that isn't explicit ally stated) and got it taken off the bill. We ended up tipping anyways out of courtesy, but definitely not as much as was "expected" on the tab. Overall, the food was great, and the dry fried chicken wings were some of the best I ever had, but the service was lacking. But overall the food outweighs the service and I would come back for those chicken wings. Definitely recommended to people who love some good Chinese food.

This place is WAYYYY too crowded for a slightly over-priced, pretty-good tasting Chinese food restaurant. I don't understand the hour+ long waits during peak hours and the high demand for a table. It's good, but the lines just give it a sense of over-hype. It's not bad by any stretch of the imagination, of course. The food is well-seasoned, never too saucy or too dry. Most people, myself included, come for the dried fried chicken wings, which are always a staple on everyone's table. The combination of spicy, sweet and tangy do the trick every time. Rumor has it the secret is a combination of hot chili sauce and honey, but whatever it is, I'm a fan. Outside of this, I enjoy their dried black bean noodles, (zhajiangmian) and their dumplings are pretty good. But it's the wings that make this place a must-go. Their garlic chicken is pretty well done and it has a zeal to it that you just don't get at your other Chinese restaurants. The sauce isn't overwhelming, but it's a good complement to the ingredients. Their potstickers are not good, however. They deep fry the whole thing, instead of just pan frying the bottom parts. I did not like them the last couple times I ordered this dish and will probably stay away in the future. In addition, last time I visited with a party of 5, they added gratuity to the bill. First of all, standard practice is 6 or more and a restaurant will add the tip to the bill. Second of all, you mention that on your menu. Our table's opinion was that they knew they were going to get a low tip and made up some bullshit about it to include tip on the check. (They did very little in terms of service and checking in on us.) We argued and got our way. Watch out for that if you come with 5 or 6 people and get lower-quality service.

CHICKEN WINGS. thats all you need to know. its the best and every time i bring ppl here they are hooked with the first bite of that chicken! its a must and its 4 ppl eating..we have to order 2 orders! lol. we some hefs! i like their string beans because its sweet and flavorful! and crispy! i hate when its really soft. i like their spicy peanut seafood noodles and their pot stickers which are HUGE. black bean noodles are better at SO. the wait is ridiculous! but so worth it..they are so cramped which they would expand their restaurant. if ur hungry enough, and dont want to wait..ask for a shared table then its more a shorter wait cuz alot of times ppl dont like that cuz they want they privacy but who cares since its small and you are in close quarters already inside. lol

This place might be underrated.  Something so simple that no other restaurant has tried.  The wet wings were addicting and if you are in town or live in SF, this is a must.  We even ordered 2 to-go orders before our drive back to Los Angeles.  Unfortunately the wings didn't survive the trip down to socal.

Another plate of their Chicken Wings - DRY STYLE. Another bowl of their Black Bean Noodles. Another round of great San Tung eating. This time we got to sit in the middle. Yay for not being in front, where all the waiting-patrons just sorta stare at you. Kinda creepy, unless you're into that thing. I'm not. Perhaps they could make a trellis up to the ceiling with some plant-thingy. Wouldn't cost much. Just a suggestion.

Fact: every Asian person I know in SF has raved about San Tung. Okay, maybe that's an exaggeration - the every Asian person I know, part. The raving part isn't, because San Tung is that good. It's so good and so popular, that often times you have to strategize on how to get there, find parking, and get seated before it fills up. I've eaten various dumplings from here, but the dried fried wings and the black bean noodles are supreme. Seriously, the wings are winners. I won't wax poetic about the food since it's been said many, many times before but I will add this - San Tung also deserves 5 stars for it's service. Just last night the bf and I were waiting for our pick up order and we were chatting with the staff. Everyone is polite, they actually smile, and they're appreciative of your business. Practically unheard of at Asian restaurants. If you can't get to the Sunset easily, go to their sister restaurant SO on Bryant St (across from the Bed, Bath & Beyond/Trader Joes shopping center).

If you are from So Cal, this place is not for you. The dry fried chicken was good I must say but thats it!  This place is a Korean style Chinese place.  more than half the items on the menu are in Korean however no one here speaks Korean... Odd... We had the standard Dry fried shrimp (yuck), shrimp fried rice (edible), Dry Fried Chicken (good), Spicy Seafood noodle "Cham pong" (terrible), Sizzling rice soup (how can you mess this up??), Green Onion beef (ok), and Spicy shredded pork (it was more chestnuts than pork but the sauce was ok).  Service was the standard suck ass service you usually get at Asian places so no biggie, Super crowded so I'm guessing people really like the fried chicken here.  Parking sucks but hey, it's SF.  Call ahead for large parties.

My family and I have been coming here since San Tung's original location was on 25th and Judah, but they didn't move very far. This family owned restaurent (now run by their sons) have definitely put the restaurant on the map, as they were recently named one of the best Chinese restaurants in America by CNN Go (Link: http://www.cnngo.com/exp…). I have never been disappointed in any of my meals here, whether it is for their lunch specials, or for family style dinner. Everything on the menu here is good, but I highly recommend the following: -Pork Dumplings -Five Spice Beef Soup Noodle (noodles are homemade and always chewy) -Dry Fried Chicken Wings -String Beans -Fried Rice -Mu Shu I know nothing above is exotic or out of the ordinary, but these are my favorites on their menu. If you do come here for dinner, be sure to get here early to put your name on the waiting list. Bring your friends, your family, or even a date; San Tung will not disappoint.

I came here on a Friday during the Lenten season and almost forgot that it was no-meat day.  Well, sadly, I remembered last minute so I ordered the dry fried calamari while the rest of my family got the regular wings.  But OH. EM. GEE. the calamari was OFF THE CHAIN AMAZING!  It stayed crispy sitting on the plate as we were eating just like the wings and the meat just holds up amazingly well.  The contrast  of the crispy texture with it's dense yet tender meat just pairs so well.... It's almost on par with the wings!   Then I thought, anything dry fried with their yummo sauce would be delicious but I was wrong.  We also ordered the dry fried shrimp but that was not so great--it got soggy way too fast.  Never again. We also ordered an item that I now get on the regular basis which is the combination fried rice--so flavorful!  It totally has this "wok" flavor adhered to every single perfectly oil-coated grain of rice!  I'd ask for no mussels though and maybe add more shrimp instead.  The mussels that come in it are fishy yet flavorless and are tough and chewy. Another new item I tried recently is the DICED dry fried chicken.  I loved the idea that I could eat this entirely with chopsticks and not dirty my hands--everyone who knows me knows I hate to eat with my hands.  However, I found the chicken a tad bit on the dry side so much so that I'd rather get my hands dirty despite my OCD and stick with the wings from now on OR I can go with my new obsession, the calamari!

Okay, I was seriously skeptical of this place. Everyone keeps telling me how awesome the wings are here and I really came with some doubts. Not that I didn't expect good wings but come on, the best wings in the city of SF? Well I haven't tried every single wing joint in the city but I've never eaten wings this good. EVER. It destroys Kyochun chicken. Had some Black Bean Noodles as well and it was made perfectly authentic. This place is awesome...even if just for the wings.

THE BEST WINGS IN SF. No lie. I've tried these in the restaurant as well as a take home order. They were still good even after 4 hours. My taste buds pretty much died and went to heaven. The wait for the restaurant itself is kinda of crazy. My group of 5 went on a Thursday night at 5pm and we still had to wait about 30 minutes for a table. The parking around this area is also insane (as usual). The wait was definitely worth it. We had 2 orders of dry-fried wings (w/ and w/o bones), the green beans, and fried rice. They were all so delicious that I couldn't even differentiate which tasted better. I would definitely come here again.

Popped in here just to try their wings. Totally worth it. I'd recommend sharing with someone because you get a dozen wings with your order and the delicious honey glaze gets to be quite filling. And ABOUT THAT DELICIOUS GLAZE, it was sweet and just a wee bit tangy with a nice subtle kick. Purrrrfect.

BEST. CHINESE. FOOD. PERIOD. I love traditional Chinese dining. No, I'm not talking about ordering some Kung Pao Chicken or Beef and Broccoli from a Panda Express. I'm talking about having a loud and noisy dinner with your family, friends, and loved ones at a good restaurant with a revolving table, pouring hot tea for your elders, and sharing countless savory dishes together. We don't need the fancy wine, the dim lit decor, formal wear, or a quiet cricket cherp atmosphere, it's simply all about family togetherness: that's why it's called family-style for a reason! Complimentary Kimchi - http://www.yelp.com/user… As well with a pot of hot brewed chrysanthemum tea, they give you a plate of kimchi off the bat. Despite being a Chinese restaurant serving kimchi, it was a tad dry, but damn was it spicy, and hey, who doesn't love kimchi? Hot and Sour Soup - http://www.yelp.com/user… Amazing! The best Hot and Sour soup I have ever had. Usually I don't order this because in the past, some restaurants either make it way too sour or just plain bland, but this right here won me over! The hot hearty soup was LOADED with bamboo shoots, mushrooms, tofu, really shrimp, green peas, and plenty of egg drops (see picture). I didn't even have to reach for the pepper shaker like I usual do at other restaurants to spice it up. It was absolutely perfect and a great way to begin our meal. Dry Fried Chicken Wings - http://www.yelp.com/user… The star dish of San Tung. Succulent  juicy plump chicken wings lightly fried to perfection smothered in a very tangy and sweet sauce. Words can't describe, you'll just have to try em! BA-OMBB! Szechuan Tea Smoked Duck - http://www.yelp.com/user… A nostalgic favorite! I've been to numerous Chinese banquets when I was young and this specific dish brings back all the times I shared happily fighting over who gets the last steam bun, with my family. Perfectly cooked crispy half duck, fluffy soft steamed buns, hoisin dipping sauce and fresh leaks -- it doesn't get more authentic than this. The smoked duck wasn't oily, the steamed buns weren't soggy wet on the bottom, which indicates freshness, topped with hoisin and combined all together; you get yourself an amazing little roast duck bao that you've created yourself. When it comes to Chinese food, I am hard to impress. I've been eating it for over two decades after all, so my standards are high and especially if I'm going to be paying for it, it better be mind blowing. Was I mind blow? OMG Yes. Each dish hit dead center, and then some. From starting with the amazing soup and surprisingly good kimchi, to their famous wings, and ending with the very traditional and nostalgic smoked duck buns. Man.. I don't even know how the Chinese restaurant across the street stays in business when San Tung is killin' it with all this great authentic food. San Tung, I'll be back!

Chicken Wings! Chicken Wings! Gota try the dry fried chicken wings. Even my friend who's not much of a chicken wing fan loved their dry fried chicken wings so definitely try those if you haven't already. The dumplings were pretty good too, the wrap is thin which I like. Parking is really really hard to find though and there's usually a wait, so go there a bit earlier. At least the long wait will give you more of an appetite to eat more.

4 stars for the dry fried chicken wings! However, the rest of what I had over the weekend was just ok. We ordered- -Pork Dumplings (12 dumplings filled w/ ground pork and Napa cabbage $6.75): The dumpling skin was nice and thin, but the meat filling was just ok. They forgot the garlic soy dipping sauce, which would have made it taste a lot better. -Cold Noodles (In a peanut sauce topped w/ five spice beef, dried bean curd, shrimp, and julienned cucumbers $9.00): The noodles were good, but I thought the peanut sauce needed a little more salt. -Eggplant Dish: My least favorite dish of the bunch- the eggplant sauce was very bland, and they removed most of the skin, so the dish was extra mushy. Dry fried chicken wings were awesome as always! Before I think they would give you the fried chicken and the sauce on the side, but now it's already pre-mixed. I would definitely vote for getting to-go from here so you don't have to wait half an hour for a table! Parking in this area can also suck.

We came here for dinner around 5PM right after visiting the California Academy of Science and it's only 2-5 minutes away. We were so lucky, not only did we find nearby parking, our parking meter was broken (YAY!), and we on top of that we waited 5 to 7 minutes for a table for 9. We tried 9 dishes, everyone loved the fried rice, the dumplings, the black bean sauce noodles, and the CHICKEN! The chicken was delicious! Yum. I loved it.  It's a must.

I frequent this area a lot and this place ALWAYS has people waiting outside for a table. I've always heard how bomb the "wings" were at this place. So a friend and I decided to check out these wings. Now I know why people line up outside... The special wings they have are pretty amazing. They're sweet and slightly spicy (but not as spicy as their kimchi) and heavenly. I think they have honey in the sauce so you must eat them while they're hot or they're not as tasty. We also had the cold plate, something I always enjoy eating. The jellyfish was delicious but could use less mustard sauce, the cold slices of beef were amazing, and so were the eggs. Some of the other dishes were solid even though I can't remember them because the wings were so bomb.

HANDS DOWN - THE BEST CHICKEN WINGS EVER = 4 Stars!!! The negative feedback that I have is, the place seems a little small which makes it crowded especially with the wait. Also, the line to get your reservation goes out the door (I don't blame them, food is great) - Although, I don't mind waiting -- IT'S WORTH IT!! I do think that its better to dine in vs ordering for take out because they give you more in serving.   I'm hoping that sometime in the near future, they will offer Delivery Service!! =)  San Tung Chicken Wings are Perfect for Parties!!!

Dry Chicken Wings. Enough said. Not to be outdone, but San Tung's wings greatly outshine anything on the menu. The first time I ate here the line was out the door (the normal sight outside), so expect the wait. But as they say good things come to those who wait. Oops, I meant GREAT. I looked at every single table and without fail every one had an order or two of these delectable wings. The wings were perfectly fried not dry or over sauced. The wing is the perfect balance of a salty fried chicken wing with some great spice. *Tip- The regular wing is okay, but order the Spicy trust me. I have sweet dreams that visit me at night of little wings floating in my belly. Worth the  visit every time.

Its been years since I've eaten here, but after running some errands in San Fran I took the opportunity to grab some take out.  I would go to this place for one thing and one thing only - DRY FRIED CHICKEN WINGS. In the industry where I work, we use the term, "Unsurpassed" rather than "Best" or "Better than the Rest."  San Tung's wings in my opinion are unsurpassed, and I have yet to find anyone else matching them in texture and flavor.  How to describe them?  The Dry-Fried versions look closer to glazed BBQ chicken wings as opposed to breaded fried chicken. Biting into one of these and you get this surge of heat from red chili's, but then you also get this taste of sweet honey-like burst too that neutralizes it?  The meat is perfectly cooked too.  I'm wondering what other secret ingredients are in the spice rub because these are addictive!   I bought two orders for take out, drove from the Sunset District back home in 1-1.5 hr traffic jam and I simply didn't care.  I had some serious good eating looking forward to to share with the missus and the constant aroma of the wings permeating inside my car kept me smiling all the way through.  Got home, waited a few hours for wife to return, and then attacked the wings.  Were they cold and soggy by then?  Nope, still warm enough and unsurpassed in flavor.

People seem to be under the impression that San Tung is an authentic Chinese restaurant. While the wait staff mainly speaks some form of Mandarin, the menus are filled with Chinese characters, and the restaurant does serve up a delectable selection of (American) Chinese favorites, this place is by no means authentically Chinese. First off, San Tung's signature dish, the Original Dried Chicken (Ganpengji, or Korean "Gganpoongi") is not a dish ubiquitous to the sinitic mainland. Ganpengji, in fact, isn't even ubiquitous to the providence of Shan Dong, the restaurant's namesake; the only place in China you'll actually find Ganpengji as a local favorite is in various cities of Guangdong province, and remote areas of Shanghai. The only dish which comes even remotely close to Ganpengji that is commonly found in the mainland is Lashaoji, (Spicy Chicken)  although it isn't cooked "dry" like Ganpengji. Next we have the Zhajiangmian (Black Bean Noodles, or Korean "Jjajangmyun"). I've tried three different styles of Zhajiangmian at three distinctively different sinitic locales, all of which San Tung deviates from. The most famous style of Zhajiangmian is served in the Forbidden City, amicably known as the "Old Beijing Style Zhajiangmian" (Lao Beijing Zhajiangmian). This style of Zhajiangmian usually comes in the form of a bowl of noodles with a small amount of thick but concentrated oily ground pork and chopped onions fried with black bean paste in the middle, which the customer usually mixes well with the noodles to distribute the otherwise super oily and super salty paste. The second style and most savory version of Zhajiangmian I've encountered in the Sinitic lands is the Taiwanese style, where the "sauce" is composed mostly of black bean and has a more sweet but mellow flavor. The last and the least delectable style of Zhajiangmian one should ever try is served in the Northeastern Provinces, where the  Noodles are immersed in an extremely diluted black bean soup (yes, soup!), providing for an all-around bland and extremely unpleasant culinary experience. The type of flour mix they use here for the steamed/boiled pork dumplings (Shui jiao) here are also inconsistent with the more Sinitic schools of dumpling skins; the dumplings also lacked a distinct flavor, which is usually not the case with Chinese pork dumplings which tend to be juicier and flavorful even without the addition of soy sauce and vinegar. And now on to the more subjective parts of matter. I came here with a friend around 1310 on a Monday afternoon. When I arrived, I was promptly placed on a waiting list, and seated about 15 minutes after my name was scribbled onto a dry-erase board on the left side of the door. As per Yelp's recommendations, we ordered both the "dry" and "wet" dried chicken, the black bean noodles, and the dumplings. The "dry" dried came out within five minutes of our order, just about the time we noticed the subtitle on the window outside that read "shui jiao da wang" (King of Steamed/Boiled Dumplings) at which point we were reassuring ourselves that we had made the right choice by ordering dumplings. By this time, I was also reaffirming my aforementioned suspicions--"Chinese" restaurants never tend to have Korean supplemented in their menus; how the interior looks similar to a certain "San Wang" restaurant whose owner I had the pleasure of conversing with in Korean about six years ago, and etc. The dry dried chicken was disappointing, but in an expected fashion. It was flavorful and dry on the outside and moist on the inside like it should be, but it wasn't anything special and I didn't really taste any hint of spiciness in neither the crispy skin nor the moist center. We did concede that this may be the best we've had in the city of San Francisco, but that we've had much better in its satelliting neighborhoods, such as 99 Chicken in ECR, Bonchon in Sunnyvale or Kyochon Chicken in LA. We experienced a similar disappointment when our wet dried chicken arrived, this time with the added inconvenience of getting the sticky wet sauce all over our fingers, which made it extra hard to grab my camera-phone and instadouche my meal. The San Xian Zhajiangmian was also good, but not great. The noodles were cooked appropriately, there was an appropriate amount of flavor in the black bean paste, with little bits and pieces of squid and shrimp mixed in here and there. But again, I've had a lot better from other "Zhajiangmian restaurants" such as Yetnal Jjajang on Telegraph, Tong Soon Garden and Zazang in ECR, and so forth.   So back to the big picture, San Tung is a decent Korean-style Chinese restaurant, but it certainly doesn't outshine or come even close to any of the ubiquitous home delivery Jjajangmyun restaurants that plague every corner of every South Korean city, or their adaptations stateside. San Tung is certainly A-OK for SF, but the possibilities are endless if you're seeking something more authentic.

---------DINNER ONLY-------- SO GOOD. This place totally lives up to the hype. Came here on a Tuesday for my dear friend's birthday. Had our entire party showed up on time, we would have only waited 5 minutes. I know this place gets hype for the fried chicken (which was good) but seriously, EVERYTHING we ordered was delicious. Even the most simple dishes like vegetable dumplings were made really well. That's what earns this place 5 stars in my book. Few things to note: -You will not be seated unless your entire party is there. Make sure everyone's there! -Everything is so good so you better come with an empty stomach. -For those who frequent Chinese restaurants, there's nothing mindblowing about this place but everything is just made so well so that's what makes this place awesome Sizzling Rice Soup - Great way to start off the meal for a big group. Warm with crunchy texture from the rice yet light enough so it doesn't leave you full Vegetable Dumplings - Seriously, such a simple dish but it tasted so good. So light, not totally oily and it was awesome. Garlic String Beans - Has a slightly sweet flavor to it but DELICIOUS Mushu Wrap - This was super savory! Has a slight sweetness to it. Definitely was tastier than it looked and SO good Dried Fried Chicken - What seemed like hours later, the infamous chicken finally came out and it lived up to the hype. Crispy, slightly sweet, savory, every single word you can think to describe it. My only complaint? There weren't enough pieces to feed a group of 7 so we definitely should have ordered more :( Anyway, YUM. I would happily come back and add this to my list of "places I must bring friends to"

The "dry fry chicken" will make you wanna slap yo mama!!! The wait is loooong if you go after 7 pm, especially on the weekends, but its worth it. Service is so so, not bad, not good. Other dishes are good too, I love the garlic spinach, the vegetarian chow mien, and chicken mu shu. The location is cute (bars, restaurants, clothing and shoe shopping), parking sucks, but again, the "dry fry chicken" will make you wanna slap yo mama! ... careful though, you'll probably get slapped back!

I'm sorry San Tung, you were amazing, and your dry fried chicken will surely haunt my dreams tonight, but I had to knock off a star for your less than stellar service and the fact that none of the people who work for you seem to care about the fact that they provide this subpar service. Yes, there was a wait, but that was to be expected, so I don't begrudge you that, but even after being seated, it took us forever to flag down a waiter, who told us to wait for someone else, and then bustled away and forgot about us. After being seated for nearly 15 minutes, we finallyyyy managed to get our orders taken. Most of the food arrived pretty quickly after that... EXCEPT our chicken wings! We were finished with everything else we had ordered (including the diced dry fried chicken) before the wings arrived. That being said, the dry fried chicken (diced or wings) is sooo delicious. It's all in the sauce-- it's kind of sweet (honey maybe?), but spicy (peppers), and definitely has a hint of Chinese pepper. I don't know what else is in it, but the sauce makes the dish. Not sure why they call it "dry" fried chicken, but it's just the perfect amount of crispy. The hot braised flounder fillet was likewise, very good, and the braised tofu was pretty standard, but if you don't get something related to the chicken here, then you're totally missing out. While you're waiting outside, check out Next Door Sweets-- owned by the same people as San Tung, so they get to take your money twice. tl;dr: I can't believe it's just chicken! Get it. Otherwise, be prepared to regret your poor decision making and question why you didn't decide to listen to all the Yelp reviews that are raving about it.

There's a reason why this place is so popular. Chicken wings. Just try them, and you'll be bound to come back another time. Cons - potstickers and dumplings weren't as good as I expected, and the waiters just never see you when you wave your hand... If you're taking out some non-chinese friends for a good place to eat and try new chinese food, definitely come here! don't come here with your traditional chinese grandparents though, they'll find something to dislike about it.

Always a very satisfying excursion, made all the more so this round by rockstar parking and a surprisingly short wait for our group, which even got into the coveted back room! Must-haves: Dry Fried Chicken Wings AND Diced - Yes, we ordered and enjoyed both styles of the same preparation. Some of us like the wings more, others the diced. I appreciate them both, and while it's great not to have to fight the bones, I still give a slight edge to the wings. But would order both in a pinch, even if I were alone. Dry Black Bean Sauce Noodles AND Black Bean Sauce Noodles - I believe the latter is the more classic and I preferred it, even if there didn't seem to be much difference between the two. Good staples: Sizzling Rice Soup Dried Sauteed Green Beans Would not order again: Shrimp with Lobster Sauce Garlic Flavored Eggplant

San Tung already has a ton of reviews, and the other reviewers really capture it.  But I'm reviewing it now for one reason:  So that I can add it to a few of my own lists!   I've been enjoying their Hot & Sour soup for a few years now, and have been telling my peeps that it's the closest I've found to our (long-closed) old favorite Golden City's recipe.  Perfectly balanced, rich with chicken and pork broth, shrimps, mushrooms, bean curd, egg flower, bamboo shoots, scallions.   Also try:  Dry fried chicken.  Excellent.  I get it boneless, but notice that a lot of other diners get the same thing as wings, and it always looks good.   They hand-make their wrappers for Mu Shu, and they are rubbery and yummy.   I also like their green beans -- so fresh and tender.   I'm not a pot-sticker fan, but if I were, I'd say these are near the top.  (Wok Shop still has the very best!)   Parking's a real sunnavabitch in this section of Irving.  And when you arrive, jot your name on the dry-erase board and be ready to wait a few minutes.  The waiters are all great, and will get you seated in no time.

All menus are Korean described as well as chinese. There were not many people outside, but around 2pm it was huge line waiting people outside. We ordered dry fried checken yesterday it was awesome. It was sweet and  crispy ... My friends told me she sometimes dreamed of chicken dried  wings. Also I was satisfied with black bean sauce grean pea. It was great and was not disappointed. I definitely will go again and will order additional take-out...

HAS THE WORLD GONE CRAZY?!?!?!?! WHY--- Please tell me... WHY are you giving this place good reviews? Why is this the most highly reviewed chinese restuarant in SF?!?!?! WAKE UP San Francisco I swear this place bribes it's reviews or something, because it is overpriced but most of all TERRIBLE Chiense food. San Tung is CRAP--- plane and simple-- . I've been here three times--- each time I was terribly dissapointed but somehow luered myself back because it is always crowded & gets good reviews so I convinced myself that I must be missing something.   This last time I went was the LAST straw. I'd expect better Chinese food off the freeway in Kentucky, yet this is #1 rated place in SAN FRANCSICO!?  The chicken is NOT chicken... it's assorted parts and does not resemble chicken meat at all. It's a pile of grissle, fat, cartiledge, and looks like rat meat.  How can they pass this off for chicken? Kung Pao was a pile of fattening greasy gravy & string bean shrimp had these frozen shrimp that were chewy and hard, broccoli beef was OK but still was very average. This place has no redeeming qualities.... it is overpriced and they cut corners in every direction.  The quality of the meat is so bad I am going to let $30 of left overs go to waste because I can't bare the thought of making a meal out of it again. Good riddance Sun Tung.

Ordered: - Dry fried chicken wings - Shrimp and chive steamed dumplings - Crispy rice soup - Ja jiang mian noodles (Black bean) - Vegetarian mushu The chicken wings are amazing and won't let you down. It's always dangerous when you hear how good something is and then your expectations are high... but they are as good as everyone builds them up to be! The rest of the food is ranked in order in which we enjoyed them. I thought the dumplings and soup were quiet good but I just don't get why everyone loves the noodles. They''ll do... but they're not spectacular in any way. The sauce is a little bland and has too thick of a consistency. The noodles themselves were good but the sauce is just too distractingly bland to really make this dish stand out. My final gripe is the wait. We came on a Sunday night at 5:30, trying to beat the crowds and had to wait almost an hour for 3 people. I have no regrets but imo, too long of a wait to repeat. I love the chicken wings so much that I'm willing to look past some of the blandness  and the waiting to give San Tung a 4. But next time, I'll head to So's in soma. Chicken wings are just as good and although the wait can also be horrendous, at least parking's easier to find!

I LOVE this place solely for their dry-fried chicken wings. And since I look silly for just ordering chicken wings, I tend to order their peanut sauce noodles as well. Those are the 2 items you absolutely need to consume. I have no clue what's in those chicken wings, but their sauce is a perfect mixture of sweet and spicy. Furthermore, as a person who strives to live a pescetarian lifestyle, this place lures me back to my meat eating ways. I have frequent this joint multiple times. And the wait time is always a turn-off for me. But with trial and error, I have discovered the secret to getting seated quickly. No, it's not batting my eyelashes at the wait staff. But it's to show up with a big group. I went on a Saturday night  with a party of 12, and my wait time was merely 15mins. The rest of the "suckers" around me, with their parties of 4, were wide-eyed with envy as my party strutted to our large table.

Anytime I hear the name "San Tung" I get excited and immediately follows are my taste buds watering. They have the best Hot and Sour Soup I have ever tasted! Very flavorful, one spoonful of that soup takes me away mentally. Warm, comforting and oh so tasteful. Believe the HYPE. The Dried Fried Chicken is the BOMB. Made crispy, savory, a touch of sweetness, and packs a lot of spice! I'm salivating as I continue to describe this piece of heaven! I recommenced to get the Diced and Wet version of it. It's easier to eat and even more flavorful. The Dried Fried Chicken is a MUST when dining here. Other must try recommendations are the Dried Fried Flounder, Dried Sauteed String Beans, Pot Stickers, and the Hot and Sour Soup. Cons: - This place does get really busy during lunch and dinner time. They have you write your name and your party number on a white board. Be sure to pay attention for they quickly move along their list if you don't hear them.

I looked forward to coming here after hearing all the rad reviews, but I was sorely disappointed. I generally don't mind lines or crowds as long as the food and service is great, but such was not the case. While we were seated almost immediately (we came around the start of the dinner rush), we did not receive our orders until nearly 40 minutes later. Huh. Now after looking at the reviews, we decided to order the famous chicken wings, black bean noodles, steamed veggie dumplings, and two other vegetarian dishes (we had a vegetarian in our group). The food: Chicken wings--I don't know if we ordered the wrong kind, but my family collectively agreed that these were mediocre at best. These are drizzled with an overwhelmingly thick sweet sauce...but I suppose everyone but my family enjoys it like that since everyone can't stop raving about it. Also, these wings aren't marinated, so there's not much flavor on the inside. Black bean noodles--A beauty on the outside, but this dish has absolutely no flavor, surprisingly. You'd expect such a thick, hearty looking sauce with thick cuts of meat to be brimming with flavor, but no, not at all. A little salt and a spicy kick would've made this one acceptable. This dish was barely touched. Steamed veggie dumplings--I did enjoy this one. While the dumplings were huge, it was simply flavored with the taste of ginger and mushrooms. I still find it weird how big and loose they were though. Not your average dumpling. Two vegetarian dishes--I don't quite remember the names of the dishes, but these had good flavor. Very goopy and saucy though, which I suppose is very typical of restaurant Chinese food. The service: So no one really cares about the service, but seriously, it was pretty awful. We were served our first dish at 40 minutes, and two of orders were forgotten. We started at 5, ended at 7, with our last order coming in 1.5 hours after we sat. Not a good experience even if one were to like the food, no? Also, it's extremely irritating to have waiters constantly distracted by the line outside while taking your orders. Very rude. However, I do see why this restaurant would draw a lot of people in. The food, while not to my taste, does have its audience. Mediocre food, terrible service.

"San Tung" or Shandong cooking is a very different culinary experience from that of many SF restaurants out there, which predominantly feature Southern Chinese cooking.  For those reviewers and diners that aren't aware -- Shandong is known, amongst other things, for its dumplings, use of grains (in noodles and breads since the climate isn't as great for growing rice), and cabbage (which is used for Shandong's own type of preserved, spiced vegetable, which many would term "kimchi.")  All of these things resonate at San Tung, in a very home-cooked meal sort of way. IMHO, the best dishes include their dry fried chicken wings, homemade noodles that are used for the spicy seafood noodle soup as well as the zha jian mien, and their dumplings.  A lot of the other dishes on the menu are typical things that Americanized-Chinese food eaters prefer--sizzling rice soup, mushu, etc, which aren't really Shandong staples.  Though, San Tung does a nice job of preparing these items, too.  By adding these dishes to the menu, San Tung has done an oustanding job of attracting a broader clientele base, that may not normally be attracted to Shandong food.  Other northern Chinese restaurants haven't faired as well in gaining the mass popularity of San Tung, and remain lesser-known hole-in-the-wall joints, though their food may be just as good, if not better and more authentic. The fact that this place is overrated and misunderstood doesn't detract from the fact that it's a decent restaurant serving tasty food that acts as great gateway restaurant for other Northern Chinese cuisine.

Came here on a Sunday evening, against my better judgment I decided instead of my usual take-out food during finals, I thought it may be appropriate to sit down and eat like a normal person.  I knew this place was popular, but I didn't know the wait was so ridics - even with reservations, we still had to wait about 30 minutes.  Coupled with the long wait + the necessity of returning to the library where I sleep during finals, the food was still worth it.   I let my friend do all the ordering because at that point I was 9 hours into studying that day and I was literally a robot who zoned out at the table.  But when the food arrived I was quickly perked up.  The dumplings, soup and the chicken wings are definite highlights.   Service is quick after you're seated - but honestly, next time I rather do take out because the ambiance of the restaurant and the wait is just not going to work for me (with or without finals).  Unless there's a wait for take-out too..........

After 4 years of living in the city I have FINALLY had San Tung! First thing ordered, the dry-fried chicken wings of course and man are they worth of all the praise. Now are they better than SO's...well I wouldn't say better just different. They are both the epitome of a good chicken wing and I'd be damn happy if I had a plate of either in front of me right now. What makes them so good? As all the other reviews note, they are served hot a f*#@, ridiculously crisp, and yet saucy...what the? It's one of those mysteries that I'll never solve. Although I could've just gorged myself on wings, my wife would have it, so we alos ordered some tofu and some noodles...pretty standard fare and on par with your favorite Chinese restaurant. Come for the wings and leave happy

I came here with my boyfriend during the lunch special hours. We ordered the wet chicken wings & Mongolian beef which included soup+rice. The soup came first which I didn't like at all.  Then came the chicken wings, beef, and rice. They only gave us 6 chicken wings, and the price of it was $7 something I believe. There was barely any beef it was mostly veggies. I would only come back here if I'm craving for the wings otherwise it isn't worth my money. The service this time was a 8/10 since the other times I came here it was 4/10.

I met up with a friend here during my most recent trip to San Francisco.  As soon as I stepped into the restaurant I knew it must be good.  The place was a predominantly Asian clientele with tons of people waiting for tables.  We went on a Thursday night at around 6:50 pm and ended up waiting until about 7:35 pm for a table for 3. When we sat down I flipped through the menu a bit until I realized that my friend knew exactly what she wanted to order for us before we had walked into the restaurant.  She ordered: 1) Dry fried chicken wings, no bones 2) Pork and leek dumplings 3) Noodles in black bean sauce Came out to about $10 per person, pretty typical for a Chinese restaurant.  From the other reviews, I'm sure I do not need to tell you how delicious it was.  I know, I was thinking the same thing too - really?  Chinese restaurant?  Fried chicken?  But really, Chinese or not, you can't come here and forgo ordering it. The service is not that good, but that's because there are so many people in this restaurant and all of the waitstaff are extremely flustered and don't have time to be polite or attentive.  I'd definitely come back here for the food.

Yummm I've been here twice so far. The first time we came pretty late on a weekend and the wait list was pretty long and we decided we would just order togo and eat elsewhere. The second time, we came during off hours on a weekday and were able to get a table within 5 minutes. The chicken wings were awesome! I wouldn't over indulged in them since there's wayyyyy too much sugar in the sauce, but overall delicious. Their sauce isn't that unique, I've had it many times before at other restaurants, the difference is they add more sugar and it's on chicken instead of fish! This is definitely a place you should try out. Be cautioned that the wait for a seat might be pretty lengthy =]

I'm not from the city but when I do come, I like to take my friends here if they haven't been here already. Their dry fried chicken is good, along with their string beans, cherry pork, dumplings, and peanut noodles. It can get really busy and long waits, but it's worth it!!! I'm waiting to go back!!

Rain or shine, I normally order the same three dishes whenever I come here.  Only because I've fallen in love with it so much that I refuse to try something new.  Yeah, I'm a pretty committed girl, what can I say: [Good for 2-3 heifers or 4 average people] -Original Fried Chicken Wings, Dry: This is a MUST.  You cannot eat here without ordering this unless you are a vegetarian.  If not, people like me will JUDGE YOU and think you're like one of those people that NEVER knows how to order food.  Like that one friend that most of us have who we love dearly but hate eating out with.   Whenever I eat out with him/her and it's that person's turn to decide where to eat, he/she will take me to the tackiest food chain out there and when it's my turn to decide, they ALWAYS order the wrong dish that no one really orders and then complain about the restaurant the rest of the night.  So yeah, long story short: if you like meat, you have to order this.  Also, make sure to order it "dry", it tastes a lot better. -Seafood Combination Fried Rice: Only because I need my rice fix in order to eat my wings.  I'm Filipino, I have to have rice with almost everything.  If not, it would feel incomplete.  Think of it as salad without the dressing...except, extremely more fattening. -Spicy Seafood Hand Pull Noodles: Sooo amazing.  Yes, I know I know, I order mountains of carbs whenever I go here.  But, It's worth the extra Zumba class at 24.  The broth is on POINT and the seafood is mouth watering delicious.  Most importantly, the noodles are very fresh and is very addicting.  Warning: you'll probably end up having more than two bowls. +5 because the service is fast, the food is AMAZING, the price is reasonable, and parking is really easy here.  Also, if you are a heifer dessert person like myself, there's a really good pie place, Peasant Pies, right next door.  The vanilla pie is worth trying after this meal.  (yes more carbs!!!)

After my last visit, I need to give this review a bit of a facelift; I'm expanding upon it greatly. Starters, people who rated this place one and two stars are morons. Do not listen to them. The wings are very special, and it was agreed upon by my group at our table that there are perhaps equal wings on the face of the earth, but none superior. They're cooked to perfection, slightly crispy outside, soft inside, coated with some sort of teriyaki-tasting sauce. But they MUST BE EATEN WITHIN MINUTES OF CREATION FOR MAX ENJOYMENT. The veggie chow mien was fantastic. To my surprise, steamed pork dumplings were better than the fried chicken pot stickers. The aforementioned dumplings were quite excellent. I'm not a huge service nazi, but Tung's is not great. It takes them way too long, as in mid-meal after you ask, to drop water. And they forgot my delicious Coke until then as well. The food does come out hot though. There is a wait to be seated, but life can be a real bitch sometimes, so that is not factored into this review.

This place is the only place I'll eat chicken wings. I guess I should first say that I don't chicken wings. I like chicken but there's something about chicken wings that I just don't like. This place is amazing. Well, amazing for one thing, their dried chicken wings. I love their dried chicken wings. My brother has told me to try their noodles before since he says they're handmade but I've yet to order anything else. the dried chicken aren't really dry. They're crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside pieces of chicken covered in a sweet AND salty glaze. YUM. Be ready for a wait though and parking is a hassle.

Even though the service is terrible, I still give it 5 stars because the dry fried chicken is amazinggggggg. NOMMM. I prefer it to be diced, less work for me, but if you like wings, get the wings! The rest of the items on the menu are alright but the chicken definitely takes the spotlight. It would be a waste of a trip if you don't try the chicken. The menu has all the normal Chinese dishes (like honey walnut shrimp yum), so take your pick. There is definitely a wait, but you could make a reservation if you have at least 8 people. I think it's 8? I'd still show up early though. & parking can definitely offset your estimated time of arrival.

Wow, when did Chinese food become a hipster spot? A couple years ago I had a job that scheduled me to work on Sunday nights, thus forcing me to miss out on many family gatherings such as Mother's day, Father's day, birthdays, etc. And this restaurant was the go to restaurant for those celebrations. I finally made my way to San Tung for dinner the night before my birthday. NO WAIT! I'm glad we came at the time we did, because the line started piling up. Babe and I ordered the infamous chicken wings, peking duck, the sizzling rice soup and the kimchi fried rice. The sizzling rice soup was exciting to listen to and the kimchi fried rice was not bad. The peking duck was nice and tender with the soft, pillowy lotus buns.The best part of the meal was the chicken wings. Saucy and delicious, this is probably what makes San Tung the new hipster spot.

Oh how I miss SF. Not because of the shopping and hipness and the memories, but because of the fricken bomb ass SAN TUNG CHICKEN WINGS! Man oh man, THESE THINGS ARE DELICIOUS! So, I used to come here everytime I visited the ex and his family and this was always a MUST VISIT when I came up. Beware: - Lines are sometimes ridiculously long and there's very little waiting area and if you're like me and hate the cold, BRING A JACKET because you'll have to stand outside.... - PARKING IS A NIGHTMARE! As with all places in the sunset area, good luck finding parking.. only street parking is available Things I've tried: Chicken Wings: DELICIOUS! SUPER CRISPY AND SUPER FLAVORFUL! The order comes with a bunch of them and yah they're messy to eat but completely worth it. I mean ok, ALL OF MY NORCAL FRIENDS AND I LIKE IT...that has to say something or Zha Jiang Mian: Basically noodles in a black bean sauce with beansprouts and ground pork. This is pretty good, it's just not my kind of thing. The ex loves this stuff and I have to admit it's really flavorful and better than some I've had in SoCal. Pretty good. Si Ji Dou or String Beans: one of my all time fave chinese dishes. Basically string beans stir fried with garlic and ground pork. Consistently good and delicious and flavorful. Overall, I really like this place. I mean I still crave it now...I guess it's time to go back up to NorCal!

This place has great dry fried chicken wings!!! They are crunchy on the outside and very moist and tender on the inside. The flavor is Killer, its a bit sweet, spicy and just damn good. The food in general is tasty, i've had the green beans, broccoli beef, fried rice. Everything is very traditional and good, but the go-to are the wings. Every time I have come, there has been a crazy line or some kind of wait because this place is so popular. I prefer to call ahead and order to-go...Chinese food is always good re-heated anyways, Lol. And the seating is meh...

It's close to 5 am in the morning here in Austin, TX and with all the Super Bowl talk going on this week, everyone is also talking about what to eat...dip, pizza, WINGS. When I hear that word, I am then taken back to a fond memory of this magnificent Chinese restaurant, somewhat secluded in a neighborhood, also known as San Tung. They should consider mounting a sign that says, "Home of the Most Badass Wings You Will Have In Your Life" because from the outside, it looks ordinary. My wife thought it was insane of me to suggest taking a 40 min bus ride for this, with an extra 20 min wait in line. But I had faith in my fellow Yelpers, even risking the trip to the doghouse. Walking out with 2 dozen dry wings, still scorching from underneath the boxes, we tactically used our napkins and chopsticks to get a taste. And after our burned tongues got used to the heat, the flavors of the dry wing hit us and we experienced awesomeness. Salty, sweet, crunchy, gooey, all at the same time. It's hard to describe, yet I can still taste it in my mouth after 8 months of San Tung abstinence. Moral of the story? Live in SF or have the money to visit often just to get enough of San Tung wings!

I came across San Tung a couple of years ago and was never a big fan of Chinese cuisine until I experienced this restaurant.  It is nestled in the busy area of the Inner Sunset and very easy to find.  If you plan to eat here, good luck finding parking.  It takes at least 30 mins to find parking nearby, best option the N-Muni.   Food - They literally have the best potstickers and chicken wings (before my vegan days) in San Francisco, by far!  If you're in the area, San Tung is the place to eat authentic Chinese cuisine!  Bon Appetite!

San Tung is THE spot for Korean-inspired Northern Chinese food. Despite having to journey to the Inner Sunset, like the Black Eye Peas I just can't get enough. The menu of a dozen pages is too long for my attention span and insatiable hunger, so I always get the same items again and again... and I'm always happy over and over. The dry fried chicken wings are incredible--crisp yet saucy, savory yet sweet, juicy, tender, oh-so-perfect. Hands down the best fried chicken I've eaten in SF. I could honestly devour the plate of 12 pieces by my calorie-lovin' self. The dry black bean sauce noodles are also noteworthy. The noodles are made in house fresh to order, and the chewy texture is just right. Despite that the sauce looks like a black pile on the noodles, they still shine--and it's not from the grease! Oh, and I love the complimentary kim chee. It's so addictive. I hope it doesn't contain MSG, but I'd still happily eat it if it did. Free and delicious things are rare during these hard times. Everyone seems to like the dumplings. They're not a big deal to me. They're decent and dirt cheap, but come on--after you've had the xiao long bao at Yank Sing or even Shanghai Dumpling King, you know that dumplings are not created equally. The soup ones are simply the best. I'd drive here every week if I had a car. Who knew wings could taste so wonderful?

????????? What? Why? Why does everybody, Yelpers or otherwise, love this place to pieces? I asked the server what kind of cuisine they serve and they said they were all Shangdong people. I told them I was from Jinan and was excited to try their food. My hometown in China is in Shangdong and it's hella close to Korea. I preemptively exclaimed to my fiance, "get ready for a taste of my hometown!" The first dish that came out was a complementary dish of Chinese kimchi. Super spicy, not so much fermented. It tasted good with a bowl of rice. Then came our potstickers, they were a pretty good start, the bottoms were delightfully burnt and they were huge and super juicy. It was like eating a big soup dumpling with a thick skin. Next, the server plopped the green beans and ja jiang mian (black bean sauce noodles) on the table. The beans were really sweet, that was the biggest flavor that shone through and they became hard to eat after a few bites. The ja jiang mian's sauce was pretty weak, diluted by too much cornstarch, there wasn't that distinct salty and slightly sweet fermented flavor that is usually associated with good ja jiang mian. Still at this point, we were holding out that the chicken wings would be amazing. When the wings arrived on the table, I eagerly bit into a crunchy one. Blargh, it was seriously too sweet, gross! I like the sweet and savory mix just as much as the next person but I don't like it when my meat tastes like dessert. After a cup of tea I was ready to try another wing just in case the first one was a fluke. Nope, it wasn't. I dipped my finger into the chicken sauce and tried it on its own, ugh, so saccharine it could be the syrup for a cola.  If I wanted to eat this kind of chicken I would've just gotten the honey bbq chicken wings from KFC.

If you're an avid fan of chicken wings, then you should try San Tungs famous wings.  But everything else here is just ok. I do admit, their Chicken Wings were delicious when I ate them... HOWEVER, I did have to wait 45 min for a table so by the time I had them I was starving. Out of the things we ordered, the few dishes that I can remember having were the chicken wings, shrimp dish, string beans, and dumplings.  As I said, the Chicken wings were pretty tasty, but the shrimp dish and string beans tasted very similar and the dumplings were whatevers.     The majority of their dishes are on the tasty (Salty) side, so if you don't eat too much white rice like me, then you'll find their dishes on the salty side. True, this is your typical Chinese joint - the service wasn't exceptional, but they were fast and they were competent.  It's a bit of a tight squeeze if you go with a big party so do expect to be cozy.  Parking is similar to a lot of other place in San Francisco - street parking and hard to find but not impossible. I'd come here again with friends, but I wouldn't be the one to request it.

(3.5 STARS) Chicken wings!  You see it on everyone's table.  Crunchy with a not so sweet sticky sauce. I ate about 8 wings myself! (good thing I ordered 2 plates of it.) We also had fried shrimp, dumplings, fresh noodles with peanut sauce, and their green beans were also a favorites. Parking is next to none and service was below ok. We felt rushed when ordering and we had to keep asking for water. Very busy, but worth the wait. I will try their potstickers next time. It looked good and a lot of people were eating it.  We will be back!

You walk in and you see EVERY table has an order of the dry fried chicken wings. That's what they're famous for! The chicken wings are a must try. The skin is crispy and the sauce is delicious. Other items that I've tried are dry fried green beans, dumplings, black bean sauce, and shrimp fried rice. They were all good as well. The place gets crowded during lunch and dinner. So come early for lunch (like when they open) or the between hours of lunch and dinner.

Every time I have friends from out of town visit me, I HAVE to bring them to San Tung! Especially if they appreciate some good chicken wings! My friends and I came here on a rainy Friday afternoon, the place was packed but there was one table available. We were the first group to show up so we thought we would be seated immediately but the waiter had us wait as he cleaned up the table. I'm not sure what happened but he ended up giving our table to a group that showed up after us. My friends and I were not pleased but nothing would stop us from getting some awesome chicken wings! As we were deciding what to order, we were given a small dish of kimchi and it was good! Nothing beats tasty snacks before your main meal! We ended up ordering shrimp with leek dumplings, beef tripe, shanghai style wet noodles and the dry deep fried chicken wings. All of the dishes were great! But our favorite dish was, of course, the wings! Our second favorite dish was the beef tripe! Mmm... All this reminiscing is making me crave for some San Tung right now! Get there early! Or you'll have to fight your way into the restaurant!

The original dry fried chicken (diced or wings) is what you should get here.  As much as I like the version from SO Restaurant, I like these a bit more since you get drumsticks and not just wings (as you do at SO).  The seasoning is also not as garlicky here. That being said, I prefer the black bean sauce noodles at SO (has a spicy kick to it). The potstickers were ok as was the sweet and sour soup.  Really liked the green beans. Service is whatever but I don't think people frequent San Tung for its attentive waitstaff. Not open Wednesdays.  Don't take reservations.

Great Food, Bad Service. If you come in during their busy hours, feel free to grab the dry erase pen and write your name down (and party size) on the board. I wrote my info down, and a waiter came and asked if everyone was here. I said that we're still waiting for them, and he promptly said "That's a problem", turned his back and walked away. Wow. Anyways, food is great - though the quality seems to have slipped just a bit since a year or two ago. Still very good, but a bit of a rush job. As everyone else says, it's all about the dry fried chicken wings. It's a bit confusing since it's technically called "Dry Fried Chicken Wings (Wet)" - at least the ones I love. BTW, the waiter practically berated my friend who was ordering these, yelling at him about the difference between the styles and nearly getting into an argument. Then his wife switches to Mandarin and he's suddenly very polite. Highly suggested are the potstickers (huge, with crispy bottoms), black bean sauce noodles, and green beans. A lot of stuff here is sweet and spicy, very different from your typical Cantonese stuff in Chinatown. Anyways, if anyone from San Tung is reading this - your food is great, don't change that. But please teach your employees to treat your customers with a bit of courtesy, even when you're busy. That will earn you 5 stars in my book.

love this place! i'm all about the dry chicken wings. i don't even mind picking up the bad boys with my fingers and getting sauce all over my face. it's cool, because everyone else is having just as much of a foodgasm as you are. other items i'd recommend are the sauteed string beans and the potstickers. each potsticker is  literally the size of my fist! delicious, cheap food that hits the spot every time. however, what i love most is being able to skip the line and secretly get these wings without having to wait for over an hour. the secret to skipping the long long line? go immediately next door to the "next door desserts" place. it's also owned by san tung, and you can sit there and order anything off the san tung menu and have it served to you there (with the exception of the mushu and the szechuan duck). GO DO IT!!! and cop a delicious ice cream while you're at it!  but if i go there next time and see a packed dessert house in addition to a packed San Tung, i'm definitely going to have to take this review down! awww yeah.

The #20 Fried Chicken (Dry) Lunch Special for $7.00 ($7.60 with tax) is  amazing!! It comes with six wings--a mixture of mostly drumettes and wings--, white rice, and hot & sour soup. The Fried Chicken is bursting with flavor! The soup, however, was a little too peppery for my taste. The pepper completely over-powered the soup to the point where it was unappetizing. I would recommend asking for a few napkins because you are definitely going to need them! The service, on the other hand, was a disappointment. The servers I encountered came across as abrasive and unfriendly. Although their Fried Chicken was delicious, it isn't something I would order if I was starving.

2500+ reviews, what do I have to add that hasn't been said already? YES, the wings are bomb. Crispy, sweet, tangy, finger-linkin good. It's an addiction worth $10 for about 10 wings. If you don't like chicken, they have Fried Dry Beef (same flavors as the chicken wings, but in beef form). The chicken is better, but the beef is good just cus it has that same delicious sweet crispiness. DON'T get both the chicken and beef. Too much of the same flavor = food coma for days. Also, their combination fried rice is hella legit. Perfect flavor, not greasy. I loved it. But at the end of the day, it's all about their chicken wangs.

It's crispy and sweet but not too sweet and just unffff. the string beans are also amazing. Why can't they open a San Tung in Millbrae? I'd practically live there..

A must visit place when i'm in N.CA. I'm not a fan of Chinese food, but I love San Tung!! I can eat their chicken wings and dry black bean sauce noodle. ** The noodle is cooked perfectly with the sauce and garnish with cucumber. It's a little bit oily, but it's Chinese food... shouldn't feel surprised. ** The wing is sweet and spicy. the combination of the crispy skin and uber tender meat is the perfect combination. I can finish the whole plate myself =p It's always croweded, but it's all worth it in the end.

San Tung's dry fry wings are amazing. And they better be goddamn amazing since there's always a line and you have to put up with one of the most shitty service this side of the Soup Nazi. Seriously, these Asian cats could give a shit about their customers. I've been there so many times and they are rude beyond my expectations from an Chinese restaurant (note, I'm Asian and live on Clement Street) If Harold Camping wasn't a lying piece of crap and the apocalypse was going to happen, one of things I'd do is to walk down to San Tung and beat the living crap out of the rude servers at San Tung. But before I'd take my federally funded training of kicking ass and taking names later, I'd first steal about 1,000 dry fry chicken wings. These dry fry chicken wings are freaking amazing. I can't even explain to you how good they are so you should try it yourself. But before you try out their five star dry fry wings, be prepared for their one star service. Five star food + One star service + one star long line + one star shitty parking  = 2 crappy dry fry chicken wings stars.

After reading the great reviews on here & it rated 4 stars, I decided that I just had to go here for dinner. You have to write your name on a dry erase board, there is no place to wait except 5 chairs at the front door. The place is so noisy, floors are dirty & waiters walk around with dirty aprons on. The service sucked, we had to ask if we could order after 15 minutes. The hot & sour soup was pretty good, the dumplings could be better, the  sweet & sour pork was all fat, over cooked, & had an odd taste. We also had chicken & garlic sauce which was ok, & green beans with chicken, again just ok. I can't understand why it's so packed & what draws people to this place, maybe they made the same mistake as I did & read the reviews on here.

THEIR CHICKEN WINGS! They are just PHENOMENAL. My mom wanted some dry fried chicken wings without the sauce, and the guy taking the order just shook his head and said "No sauce, no flavor". And the sauce is just SOOOO GOOOD. It's sweeter than I was used to, but it was a good balance of flavors. The skin was crunchy and the sauce was just a little bit sticky and it was a good texture as well. I got their spicy string beans, which were also sweet and not at all spicy, which I was kinda sad about, but it was really fresh and that made a huge difference. I'd definitely go back! :)

Living in the inner sunset area for 4 years, San Tung is one of those consistent places where I can always count on for a good meal, always be prepared for a wait though, the  most I've waited was around 30 min. Their focus is on northern China cuisine which is a lot of carbs, dumplings with different fillings, buns, and noodles.  I love their pork and cabbage dumplings, I always feel like there isn't enough on the plate to go around.  Their seafood ja jie mei is really delicious and don't let the black looking sauce turn you off. Dried Fried chicken, what can I say, is one the most delicious things I've ever tasted, and now that I moved away from the area, I realize how much I took those delicious chicken for granted.  I prefer the wings/drumstick over the chicken bits, because I feel like I get more meat with the sauce, the chicken bits have more batter to meat ratio. I always get the sautéed string beans after all the fried goodness. Their service is similar to those of Chinese restaurants, they get the job done with no fluff.  Although on good days, you may get the brothers in a good mood, and the liquor will start flowing, in Chinese teacups no less.   You wouldn't think of San Tung as a place to drink, BUT I have left that place feeling both full and tipsy.  The food they serve although traditional is also great bar food.  The ambiance of the place is set up as a social gathering, with both young people and families alike. I miss you San Tung, you will always have a fond place in my heart.

HOLY SHIT AMAZING! I seriously CRAVE the dried fried chicken wings here! Gosh, I want some right now... Mmmm! Came here on two occasions and I loved it both times. There's usually a wait, but I haven't ever waited for over 30 minutes before. The service is pretty good for a Chinese restaurant. Besides the Dried Fried Chicken Wings, I've also had the Shrimp and Leek dumplings, Black Bean Sauce Noodles, and the Combination fried rice. I would definitely go back here!!!

Oh wow. Best chicken wings ever and honey I've had a whole lotta chicken wings in my life. Just so wonderfully crispy and that sauce a lil spicy and garlicky and sweet and sticky. Maybe a bit too sweet, I had to take breaks and eat other stuff to cleanse the ol palate. Also had a tofu dish and it was solid, so not just a place for wings (though you're a fool if you come here and don't order them). That said, there's a good 40 min wait  even if you come early and it's loud and crowded and rushed and service is not great. But they take credit and there's actually a good amt of parking nearby :)

Just do yourself a favor and order the chicken wings.  Once you start, you won't be able to stop.  You'll crave them, daydream of them, and lick your fingers unconsciously.  They're THAT good. Their black bean noodles and spicy seafood noodle soup are delicious as well. This place is bumping though! Be prepared to wait for a while.  I'd suggest order to go, take those bad boys home and indulge.

Came in a party of 9 and got a table in 5 minutes around the 6pm mad dinner rush. This was the highlight of dinner. It was also the first time I saw a line for the men's bathroom. We ordered ~10 dishes dried fried chicken (2), happy family, sizzling rice soup, black bean noodle, dried fried beans, a tofu dish....but between every dish there was a waiting period. It gave me a chance to write this Yelp! review. The food was overall good, but the food needs to come a bit faster. The bill came out to be a little more than $120. We were there for about 1.5 hours. The large table next to us was there for probably a good 2 hours. San Tung must be doing something right if people are still piling out the door at 8pm.

A Chinese restaurant known for their chicken wings WTF! i wasn't even planing on ordering the chicken wings, but once i saw chicken wings on every single table i had to try them. Personally it was ALRIGHT! The chicken wings were super crunchy and the sauce was sweet. If it's your first time here, i suggest you order it to see what all the hypes about. But overall it's just your average Chinese restaurant that happens to serve chicken wings, and gives free kimchi appetizer haha The service is super fast here, the line for this place is crazy during dinner time, at least an hour wait so come early! Lunch time is not so much. Only street parking which is always annoying

The dried fried chicken wings are amazingggggg! They are a MUST HAVE!! The sauce is sweet like honey but with chili peppers for a little kick. I'm in love!! My favorites are the potstickers, dried sautéed string beans, and the dry fried flounder fillet. My boyfriend always gets the spicy combination seafood soup which is delicious as well, but my tongue is always on fire. Sure there is always a line, but its so worth it. Eat here and you will not be disappointed! :)

Yes, the dry fried chicken is da-bomb: sticky, spicy, salty and delicious. But that's about it. People rave about it, but there's really not much that's authentic about its Chinese food. The Tea Duck had the correct flavor, but the duck was so shoddily prepared that the meat had visible bits of quill embedded in it (the thick white part of the feather). EEEEW! Hot & Sour soup was neither spicy nor sour, and it was off-putting to find those cheapo freezer bags of veggies (cubed carrots, peas & corn) in the soup. The potstickers, while very large, were not particularly yummy. And when we asked for ginger, as it is customary with potstickers, we were given a blob of chopped ginger bits -- from the kitchen for cooking - instead of the proper thinly-slivered slices.   I serendipitously learned of this place from a San Francisco native whom I shared an umbrella with in Los Angeles and was so excited to try it during my recent visit. Sad to say, San Tung doesn't live up to expectations nor the hype. I will not return, especially not with the long wait even on a weekday.

Store Notice (pls see picture attached): SUN TUNG WILL BE CLOSED FOR 2 WEEKS FROM 9/12/12 - 9/26/12!!! ____ Now back to my review... With everything on the menu with an average cost of $9.50 for Chinese food + the terrible service + mini food/toilet flies by the walls you got to be kidding me! Surely their dried fried chicken wings are delish but they don't allow an order of just wings. They add in unwanted drumstick meat which I don't eat. This place is SO over-rated! You people must be nuts to wait over an hour in line. And you guys surely never had good "Chinese" food cause this is so catered towards the American taste buds of overly salty dishes. And what makes them categorized under Korean restaurant?! Trust me, these are not authentic Korean food.

"Psssssssssst.  Want to know a secret?  There's no wait at 7PM on a Thursday night when it rains.  Just keep it between you and me, Yelp." Dry fried chicken was delicious, as expected - sweet and tangy and fried goodness.   The boiled shrimp and leek dumplings were just ok - they're small in size and number and not that flavorful.  Maybe I'm used to pork pairing with leek in dumplings, or maybe we should have gotten fried potstickers instead.  The black bean noodles were pretty good - not overly salty from the black beans.  The two vegetarian dishes were good. Overall, the service is slow, waits are long, and prices are a bit higher than other places due to popularity.  For me, the dry fried chicken is the only dish worthy of making a special visit but not worth the usual wait.

Im glad to have stopped by here for our last night in San Francisco!  Our friends took us here for a nice dinner.  They could not stop talking about their dry fried chickenI wanted to see what the hype was about!  And what I found out was that this chicken was Underhyped!! It should be hyped up even more! This was one of the best fried chicken that I have ever tasted!  We ordered like 50 wings for the 4 of us.  Next time I go back here, I will order 100 wings.  50 for myself, and 50 for whoever is with me. The service was pretty quick too.  We only waited 30 minutes which was short with the amount of people waiting outside.  We got our food within 10 minutes.  I also had fried rice with my meal.  It was delicious!  The chicken wings reminded me of bon chon, but much more sweeter and it has a lot more sauce on it.  But the chicken was still juicy!

My parents took me here very often when I was growing up. The server always remembered us too. I'm happy to see them doing so well! I've been back a couple times since I was a little girl, and I can appreciate the food so much more! I would stick with the basics - the fried chicken and dumplings. Everything else is so-so and not their specialty. The chicken is so good that I try to make it at home when I can't get out to the city. But of course it's not as good as the original!

Typical orders here: Potstickers: Huge. Green Beans: Garlicky and fresh. You can see the mountains of them being prepared between lunch and dinner times. DRY fried Chicken Wings (obviously): SO GOOD. and you can order half plates if one is too little and 2 is too much! Black Bean noodles: chewy homemade noodles! Best in SF, I'd say. Combination spicy broth noodles: (JJampong): Broth is so flavorful and delicious! I crave this as much as the chicken wings. In case you couldn't tell, i love this place. Food is not exactly 5 stars, but the service boosts it up.

This place is awesome everything Ive had here was always great. Lunchtime is easy to get a table but if you come here at night be prepared to wait 30mins-1hr but it will be worth it. My favorite is the shrimp leek dumplings, You have to get the dried fried chicken as well as this is their signature dish. Ive also had the mongolian beef which was great and not too spicy and the shrimp with mixed veggies and black bean sauce was delicious as well. IMO Best chinese food in sf.

I have been to San Tung numerous times and I LOVE the food there. It's all about the dried fried chicken wings. I don't know what they put in their chicken wings, but it keeps me coming back. The sauce, the crunchiness, the tenderness, the flavor is SO good. Talking about it makes me want to eat another order... Anywho, the other dish I like to eat here is the mu shu pork. I love playing with my food and this is the perfect dish to do that. You get the bread thing and you put your hoison sauce & onion and the mu shu pork, wrap it up and eat it. I love how the sauce drips from the wrap onto your hands. As for service, it's a typical chinese restaurant. They treat you like crap at times or not, depends on the server. For the most part, if you know the language, it's always help to speak it. You usually get better service that way. What I don't like is the long line for prime lunch or dinner time. Lunch time isn't too bad, but during prime dinner time, be prepared to wait. When you get there, make sure you write your name on the dry erase board. If you don't like waiting like me, you can always order it to go and enjoy the tasty wings at home.

They have some of the best chicken wings around. So good, in fact, they were nicknamed chicken crack. The service is also great. Even though they are constantly busy and probably stressed out, they still are very patient and provide service with a smile. They are warm, hospitable people who know how to cook AWESOME chicken wings. It is a very popular restaurant so be prepared to wait a while. I would recommend a light snack before putting your name on the list and get there as early as you can for lunch or dinner.

*DRY vs. WET* Choosing between their dry and wet wings is like asking me to choose between Adriana Lima and Alessandra Ambrósio. The former is dark, sultry, and amazing looking wet (that was a bikini reference, nothing else!). Also, it tastes like it has a little more ginger. Anyway......... the latter dry version is blonder, lighter (on the batter), and ultimately takes the cake (or whatever VS models eat. Sidenote: Is butter a carb?)

i found out about the dry fried chicken wings via yelp, so i'm paying it forward to everyone else wondering what to order here: YES, GET THEM. everything else was delicious, although i could taste the MSG dancing on my tongue, bouncing around to the beat of my chewing, lol. The fried fish also had the same magical sweet/sour/savory/spicy flavorings/marinade as the dry fried chicken wings, so that is something they know they do well. tip: we called in advance, so no wait for a table.

Long awaited visit to this place after my friends were raving about it so long. I would have to say that the Chicken Wings were really good. They were hot and fresh, I was disappointed after they were all gone. I am sure that people have difference of opinions as everyone will about the taste of the food  & claiming that this restaurant and that restaurant is better. For me this was a tasty delight for me friends and I. We were seated quickly, which was a good thing. We had a total of 4 or 5 dishes including the chicken wing which came to about $40 the portions were good, there were 3 people.  Where I live this would have been at least $20 more. The only reason I gave this place a 4 star instead of 5 is because it took a while for them to take our order (but as busy as they are i can understand) and we had to ask for water. Other than that I am willing to go here just for the chicken wings, I am now addicted and am craving for a 2nd batch. As i said earlier in this post different tastes and opinions will always thrive when food is concerned. For me this was just dandy. Thumbs up for San Tung!!!!!

Me and my friends were passing by and decided to check this place out. The line for the dining room was too long so we decided to get TOGO. TOGO took less then 3 minutes. Ate outside on the sidewalk while people waiting inline were eyeing our batch of sweet and spicy chicken wings. The wings were good, well developed flavor, juicy chicken, but it was a little too saucy for my taste(but thats because I don't like eating with my hands sometimes, but i ate the wings with chopsticks 8)...) I didn't eat anything else from there, but I enjoyed the wings and the pomp and circumstance that we caused whilst stuffing our faces outside of the restaurant. *note to self* bring folding chairs next time for a true sidewalk party!

I'm going to keep this concise or better yet, SHORT and SWEET like the: SAN. TUNG. DRY. CHICKEN. WINGS. Need I say more? What else did you expect from this review? Generic, I know but if you really want to know what the hype is all about--its the wings. It's always hyphy up in here so either brace yourselves in the cold to wait 30+minutes or call for take out? Either way, totally worth it. Some people claim that Crazy Pepper's Korean chicken wings (Near Balboa Bart ST.) taste identical but I think they're wrong. Similar? Yes. Identical? Get a dictionary. San Tung's are close to irreplaceable. THINGS TO BRING: ~Jacket: Unless you like catching pneumonia, it's your funeral. The wait will be cold and long BUT worth it. ~Hand sanitizer: I highly doubt you want to step foot in their restroom, neither did I, so get on my level and bring some hand sanitizer--you will get down and freaky-naughty once the wings arrive. You'll bring acting primitive, back! ~Dry erase pen: Upon arrival, you must sign your name with the # of peeps in your party. Whenever stuff like that is left for the customer, all hell breaks loose.

Dry fried chicken wings and sweet&sour beef(red sauce) My boyfriend, friends, and I always order them every single time. Sometimes, my boyfriend and I come here for just those two things. They never fail. But the chicken is sometimes iffy. It just depends. Sometimes it's perfect, sometimes they accidentally drop an entire canister of pepper on it. It's still delicious, but if you frequent this place a lot (like me) you'll be able to tell. The wait during dinner time is incredible. Maybe 20minutes-1hour for a table. I guess it makes sense since their popularity skyrocketed. But I've been going here since way back when so it was kind of a shock to me because I'm used to the small restaurant where my family and I got together. You can never go wrong with take-out though!

When I hear the word "San Tung", only a single image pops up: a platter of twelve delicious chicken wings drizzled in a spicy honey sauce that satisfies every single taste bud on your tongue. Dumplings? Chow mein? Sure, they were both on the menu, and I did order them... but as far as I'm concerned, San Tung's menu could just consist of one sheet of paper on it with four words in size 60pt Times New Roman font: "original dry fried chicken". Really, that's all you need to know about the place. In order to properly satisfy one's craving for these fantastic wings, the ratio of wings to consumer is, at the minimum, 6:1. After eating one, you won't be able to stop until you have at least half a dozen of them resting languidly in your stomach. Come before 5pm if you want to beat the crowd and avoid having 15+ tables listed on the whiteboard before you. People say that you are what you eat. Try San Tung's dry fried chicken, and you will be as close to perfection as you will ever be in your lifetime.

Took the bf's momma out to eat.  She always caters to ME and what I want to eat.  Lol.  She INSISTED on taking us to San Tung bc it's one of those "cater-to-Korean Chinese restaurants".  But to our dismay, there was a HUGE wait of more than 12 names ahead of us on the list.  The place was PACKED.  We decided not to eat here. Fast forward to a couple months later.  I was in the city picking something up and hit up a gf to see if she wanted to eat dinner.  I said, Let's go to Irving!!! She said, Oh there is this great place on Irving, let's go there.  I said OK! It turns out, she was talking about San Tung!!!!  I had thought there would be that awful wait but she had managed to grab the last table they had, although it was puny and shoved into the corner.  I was ecstatic!!!!! She ordered the chicken wings.  I mean how could you NOT order the chicken wings when every single person there always orders the wings?!?!?! Now I know why everyone orders the wings.  One of the BEST things your mouth will ever eat!!!!  I rarely eat chicken skin.  So horrifically bad for you.  I ate every piece of skin on more than 5 wings.  That's how amazing good it was... *sighhhhh Also ordered Sauteed spinach w/ garlic and some flounder in hot chili sauce or something?   Everything was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOD. The wait is a turn-off. The staff is just blah. But the food????? Out of this world!!!!!!

AIN'T NO THANG LIKE A SAN TUNG CHICKEN WANG. I'm probably not the first person to ever say that, but it's true. No one does WANGS like San Tung. If you look around the restaurant, every table has an order of the dry fried chicken wings. And for a reason. They are good. Really good. Like "drive out of your way and brave the difficult parking on Irving" good. The chicken wings are lightly battered and fried to the perfect crispness. If I stopped right here, I'd still give San Tung 5 stars because the chicken wing itself is perfection: perfectly crisp on the outside and tender and juicy inside. But it's the sauce that is out-of-this-world NOM NOM NOM. Whoever coined the phrase "NOM NOM NOM" had a mouthful of dry friend chicken wings in this sauce and couldn't express how delicious they were. I request the sauce on the side, so the chicken wings retain their crispness. The sauce is thick, sweet, slightly spicy and gooey. I don't know what's in here, but it's amazing. fantastic. outstanding. Truly finger-licking sticky goodness. I like to get a side of the dry sautéed green beans. Tossed with chinese pickles, this veggie dish makes me feel better mashing out on the chicken wings. The green beans are crisp and lightly tossed in a garlicky, sweet sauce. The dumplings here are also delicious and an excellent way to start off the meal. I've had the dry black bean sauce noodles and they were underwhelming. But the wings..the wings... just writing this review is making me crave them again.

We didn't really try anything else, but our friends said the rest of the Chinese food here is just average. The WINGS however. The wings were amazing, definitely get the dry ones and maybe ask for more sauce if you want, because the wet ones are a little soggy (or at least not nearly as crispy). Great for lunch or a mid-afternoon snack!

Before I go to San Tung, I always deliberate whether or not I have the leisure to wait around 30min in line to eat. Everytime I've been there, a group of people are always huddled by the entrance. But let me tell you, it is worth the wait. This Chinese Korean restaurant offers some of the best of both cuisines in town. My personal favorites are the Five Spice Beef Noodle Soup and dry fried chicken wings and drumsticks. The noodle soup is cooked to perfection and the soup is not at all oily, and extremely flavorful. I usually like to keep to dining manners and not eat with my hands. But if you ever find me at San Tung, I will be the one with a wing and drumstick on each hand, and munching them down to the bones. They are just that good. If you've never been to San Tung definitely find the time to go there once. You will not be disappointed.

The end of an era!  San Tung used to be my favorite chinese restaurant in SF.  my last three visits have changed my opinion.  On 1-5-13 I thought I would try it one more time, hoping and praying that things had returned to the restaurant I used to love to end my trips to the city with.  No such luck, in fact things have become worse.  The lines I can handle, but our two appetizers came 10 minutes after our first entree arrived.  The lemon chicken was just fried breading, the biggest piece of chicken was no bigger than a kernel of corn.  The legendary chicken wings were dripping with a cheap sugary sauce and the service was even worse than before.  The kicker was is was only 11:45 am and it looked like it had been days since they had cleaned the place.  The restrooms were disgusting.  Over all, it looks like they just don't care.

When you have dreams about a restaurants food then you know it's good. This review is long over due. Actually had San Tung Chinese for our roommate gift exchange dinner last month. I've always heard about the dried fried chicken wings and green beans, so since we were picking up sushi in the same area & I didn't want sushi, we stopped by San Tung. I got the chicken wings, the green beans and my taste buds completely blown away! These things are dangerously good. I got 2 orders to share with the group and within 25 minutes, there were 3 wings hanging on for dear life. *Spoiler Alert* pssttt..Those wings didn't make it. The green beans were good TOO! I mean San Tung, where have you been all my life?! What on Irving St...oh okay thanks for the info. I wrote this review because last night I had a dried (...get it dried chicken wings..haha) dream about these delicious wings. I'm thinking they will be a treat to have while watching my 49ers today. Hopefully the game will turn out as good as I know my wings will be. GO 49ERS and GO to San Tung and grab some wings if you haven't.

San Tung, I wish you weren't so far, because I'd frequent you so much more otherwise! The last time I came was over a year ago for a late 2pm lunch with a friend. Probably because of how late it was, we only had to suffer through a short ten minute wait. Going with the recommendations of fellow Yelpers, we went with the dry fried chicken wings, black bean noodles, and leek and pork dumplings. The chicken wings were absolutely delicious, while the other two were also quite tasty - the black bean noodles were a bit unique though, as they added a lot of various ingredients that I wasn't expecting (like seafood, if I recall). Yes, service is a bit shoddy, even for a Chinese restaurant, but it's still better than some that I've been to. For this food, I can deal.

This is an interesting northern Chinese/Korean joint, that is very different than the hundreds of other Chinese spots that dot the city. We started off with an order of shrimp and leek steamed dumplings. They were pretty good, though perhaps a little light on the shrimp. Next, we had the dry black bean sauce noodles (jiajiangmyun in Korean). This was a pretty accurate take on this popular Korean-Chinese noodle dish, and was a generous portion. We finished up with an order of their famous chicken wings (dry). They had a nice crispy texture with a lickable (and sticky) honey-chili sauce, or something along those lines. We did end up waiting about an hour to get a table at 2:30 on a Sunday afternoon, so the word (and hype) is definitely out. The food was good, but I don't know that it's necessarily worth a long wait. Takeout might be a better option next time around.

I don't mind the wait, most times it goes by really fast because the person calls the party's name three times and if no one claims it... on to the next name! When I first came here I thought their dry fried chicken was really dry. It is not. We ordered one dry friend chicken and one wet one. The dry one was by far the BEST! The sauce isn't the same. The wet fried chicken's sauce is more.... wet, not as thick as the dry fried chicken. A friend of mine came here with me and several times he said he had a boneless chicken dish that had brownish red sauce. We basically ordered everything on the chicken menu that came with fried chicken, none of them was the one he wanted. One night we went in to write our name and party number down, he pointed at a table that had the dish he remembered. I asked the waiter what dish that was and LO AND BEHOLD, the waiter said it was dry fried chicken BONELESS! I laughed the whole night about this. If you don't like having to deal with bones, get the boneless. Just know that it will be crispier and will have less meat in each bite compared to getting it with bones. My usual order when I come here: Dry fried string beans JaJang Myun Dry fried chicken (varies from boneless or with bone) Pork Dumpings The dry fried string beans is to die for.... well not really, but this is the same taste that my dad makes his dry fried string beans at home and I can't stop eating it. If I don't have the time to visit my parents, I would come here to eat because the taste is just so similar!

I came here to celebrate Valentine's Day and me & my bf bought three plates (chowmein, lemon chicken and wings) and... Some of the best chinese food I have ever EVER had. The chicken wings ...obviously AMAZING. They had me wanting more, even when I was already full. The chowmein is nothing like I have ever had..definitely great and tasty! God damn, the water here is even 5/5. Cute teas that come with it. IT'S A MUST.

First, I should say we were here on Christmas day with a large party, so our experience might not be typical.  We called to make a reservation -- knowing Xmas in a Chinese restaurant could be crazy -- and they took it.  Once we got there, though, we discovered it meant nothing:  our party's name was written up on a board once we got there and we had a 45 minute wait.  I wouldn't really hold that against them if the food had been worth the wait, which it wasn't.  As it turned out, the cheap place we went to the night before -- T and T Seafood -- was much better. The dry wings were nothing special.  The skin remained crispy despite the sauce, which I appreciated, but the sauce itself was pedestrian.  The hot and our soup was very good -- probably the best part of the meal.  The beef noodle soup -- which we had high hopes for -- wasn't worth finishing.  The bok choy with black mushrooms was ordinary -- fair enough -- not much you can do with that, I guess, except use fresh materials and not overwhelming the flavors with oyster sauce.  The pot stickers were good, and the combo fried rice was fine.  The final dish we ordered never came.  The fact that I was relieved rather than annoyed pretty much sums up my experience.   I would not go back.

Honey Chicken Wings: A+ awesome Pot stickers, string beans: good Broccoli beef: meh Price: reasonable Wait: WTF? Overall, not worth it The chicken wings really were amazing. I wish we could duplicate them. But the wait is sadly not worth it. We waited an hour to be seated which is okay considering how busy they were and how good they were supposed to be. They then seemed to seat everyone at once. Then it took another hour before the food showed up. So two hours to get food...and we were really hungry...horrible combination. Will unfortunately not be going back here.

The dry fried chicken is crispy and gooey on the outside with a sweet sauce, and tender on the inside. It's good, but after about 4 pieces, it's a bit overwhelmingly sweet. I preferred this over the "wet dry chicken wings". Don't ask me how that makes sense; you will understand when you see the menu. I wasn't a fan of the flavor of black bean noodles, but the texture was amazing - so deliciously chewy! So the next time I came, I ordered the Beef Tendon Soup. The broth was good, but nothing out of the ordinary, and came with the chewy house noodles (yum!). I wish they had more veggies and meat inside. There was literally 2 or 3 small pieces of meat... how stingy for $9!

I love Chinese food and I love Korean food. Put them together and you get HEAVEN! If you come here, you only need to order 3 things: Dry fried chicken wings, string beans, and rice. Oh, and I guess you need some water too. =P I did not come here because of Yelp. I came here because I was hungry and I wanted chicken. I actually never even heard of this place before my visit. Now I'm sitting in San Jose, on the verge of grabbing my car keys to drive all the way to San Francisco to eat their perfectly fried chicken that has a hint of a honey taste and drive all the way home to have one of the best sleeps of my life...

I can't believe I haven't written a review for San Tung! This is preposterous. I've eaten here about a dozen times, and it's always my go to spot for out of towner family members. Dy chicken wings, wet chicken wings... they're both extremely good. But most people have a slight preference over the dry ones. So flavorful and delicious. And they taste healthy if that's even possible??? These wings beat out bon chon any day. Bring it. The peanut noodles are also really good, but you know what's better? The black bean noodles aka cha jjang myun. So unbelievably delicious and flavorful. I can eat this thing on my own. The green beans are also really good. I'd skip the fried dumplings because they're huge and a bit doughy... if you like that then you might love these. For some reason, every time I go, I've never had to wait long. If you order take out, it's ready in 15 minutes and you can enjoy it in your house. I'm coming back on Thursday night to bring my sister, and I can't wait!!! Order a lot, because you won't want to share.

After hearing so much about the wings I finally decided to give the place a try. It's weird how no one says anything to you when you walk in. They'll go as far as walk up and look directly at you, turn away and go do something else. Not until someone behind us came in and made a b line to the small board on the opposite side of the door did we realize we just need to put our names up, even though there was no one on the board at that time. Weird coming in at like 4.30 you'd expect the place to be kinda empty but it was half full. After the 5pm mark this place gets crazy insane. Glad we got in when we did even though that's not remotely the time I eat. We came in because it was close to where we were and I had no idea if I'd be back in the area again. Dry fried wings, pigs ear in garlic soy and spinach/shrimp dumplings made our mid afternoon snack. Wings were definitely good as were the pigs ears. The dumplings seemed kinda pedestrian so I think if I do come back here I'd try the dry fried prep on fish or prawns the next time. Not great ambiance or service so get in, eat, get out. 3.75 stars

Based on my last review I'm pretty sure its been over two years since I've had Chinese food. Today I was oddly inspired (thanks Ruggy!) to try peanut and rooster sauce over noodles. Wow. Their peanut sauce comes with scallops, shrimp, mushroom, and peas served over fresh made noodles. Throw on some extra sriracha for added heat and this meal is about as hearty as you can imagine. Don't bother with the wait for a table, just get your food to go. I think I'll be back again soon....

Don't bookmark this as just another Chinese restaurant, they offer things here you cannot get elsewhere and it is worth the wait. What else can be said about their delicious, famous dry fried chicken wings? They are sweet and spicy, crispy and saucey. I like to ask for it to be spicier! Don't overlook other items on the menu like their dumplings and black bean noodles. Their dumplings are actually really good! And honestly, order more than you think and if you are with more than a party of four, I would double up on items. I know that it's always best to order lots of things and share so you can try a variety of things, but I actually think San Tung does a handful of things really well that I would prefer to just eat more of those items. I'll probably try to venture out more in the future. Maybe. My only complaint is that it's a very crowded place and everything happens VERY fast. The waiters are working at such a fast pace, I feel really rushed to eat and cramped. There are tables very close to each other and people waiting for tables standing right by seated customers; it also gets loud. I appreciate that they are trying to move as many people as possible and get as many people seated as they can, but it's a really frantic environment. Food is good and worth the long wait. Hope you can eat fast!

I've eaten here twice and ordered out. The first time was around dinner so we did have to wait 30 minutes. The second time, service was good because we went at 2pm when no one was really there. I've had their noodles and garlic spinach (which were good) but all that is just the background for the chicken wings! My friend argued with me that Manna's chicken wings were better. Just to compare, I ate Manna's yesterday and San Tung's today. If you need some spice in yo life, get Manna's. If you want something more mild with a touch of sweetness, like yours truly, get San Tung's.

EPIC CHICKEN WINGS!!! I don't even know how to describe them in a way that will do them justice. With the one-of-a-kind glaze that they're coated in, you won't even be mad that your fingers get sticky and dirty. Obviously it can get really busy here because of the acclaim the wings have amassed. I've gone on a Saturday for dinner and the restaurant was at capacity with people waiting outside. But last time I was here on a weekday for lunch and we were seated right away. I get TWO orders of the dry fried chicken wings--one for me to take home and one for me to eat in the restaurant. I've tried some of their other popular dishes, like the black bean noodles, dumplings, and string beans but to me they're forgettable and I go without them most of the time. Just the basics for me...give me some fried rice and those wings, please!

Mediocre Chinese food. Being Chinese and coming from a city that has 10 Chinese restaurants on the same block, this was just A-OK for me. But I know a LOT of people love this place from the thousands of reviews. The wait was around 45 minutes for my crew of 5 when we came on Monday around 7pm. We were asked if we wanted to wait longer for our own table or we could share tables with another group. Starving as we were, we took the offer of sharing with another group. We were seated and waited 15 minutes until a waiter finally noticed all of us looking at him with our hands in the air. It was a toss between the waiters because the one that took our order was ok, but the one who billed us was full of attitude. We asked for the check and HE ROLLED HIS FRICKEN EYES AND SCOFFED AT US. HELLLLL NOOO...... less tip for you mister. Anyways, food. (2) Dry Fried Chicken (boneless): 3.5 stars. We ordered two dishes of this, but am I not ordering the right thing everyone else is raving about? Because it was not THAT great. I will admit, the first few bites were really good, but after a while it was verrryyy heavy and disgusting to me. They had too much batter/sauce and too little of the chicken which made the dish overwhelmingly sweet and unappetizing after the 4th scoop of chicken. It kind of reminded me of orange chicken but over the top saucy with too much batter covering it. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Dry Fried String Beans: 2 stars. Well, i might be biased because I never eat veggies, but it was kind of plain even after it was fried with garlic and sauce. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Dried Fried Calamari: 2 stars. My friend liked this dish, but I personally did not. It was the same problem as the dry fried chicken where it had too much batter and too much sauce making it unappetizing and overly sweet. It did however inherit the chewiness it was supposed to. But I personally did not like the texture of the calamari. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Braised Bean Curd: 3 stars. It was a mix of tofu, bak choy, egg plant, cucumber, zucchini, and carrots braised  together in some sauce that was semi-sweet and semi-salty. The tofu was really plain and tasteless, but the bak choy and cucumber absorbed the sauce and was pretty flavorful. http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Portions were pretty big because the 5 of us could not finish the 5 dishes we ordered. Price wise, I actually was not able to take a look at how much each dish were but our total came out to about $66.78, $14 each person. Parking was not the greatest, but what can you expect, its IRVING at dinner time. We parked around 6 blocks away from the restaurant which didnt really bother me because it's good to walk it off after eating anyways. Unfortunately, I did not have as great of an experience as everyone else, but I know it may just be me because I have a spoiled tongue. Hope everyone else will have a good experience here though!

This review is for their dry fried chicken wings.. I have tried other things on the menu, they are good but they arent on the same level as their wings... All I have to say is I have been coming here for 7 years now, and everytime me and my friends go, we always order the same exact thing... one plate of wings each share a pot of rice and call it a day... I have waited 1 and a half hours for the place, and its totally worth it. Advice: try to go sometime around 3 or 4 during their not so peak hours, as parking around dinner time gets so crazy on irving.

We only got one thing here: the chicken wing. We got it togo, the wait was sooo long, so many people waiting outside. And it was packed inside. The chicken wing is so freaking good. Its not the most healthy thing I have to admit, but the sauce, the little kick of heat, and the crispy-ness makes it just perfect. After we were finish, we wanted more. You must get this if you are in the neighborhood!

I can see why this place is so popular with a serious wait to dine in. Ordered take-out from San Tung to avoid the long wait because we were short on time. Got the peanut cold noodles with seafood. It was really tasty. Never had peanut sauce noodles with seafood in it. I've always had it plain. Very filling though. Also got the Tea Smoked Duck. It was okay. I much rather prefer the normal peking duck. Their duck is marinated and has a different taste to it that I am not used to. Also got the seafood fried rice which is also pretty good. But you can't possibly be a Chinese restaurant and mess up on fried rice. We also got dumplings. And I have to give them one star off for not giving us any sauce for the dumplings. Not sure if they forgot to pack it in, but even if they did, five stars are for exceptional places. Sorry, San Tung. Nonetheless, I do admit, their Dry Fried Chicken Wings is the item to get! This is what everyone from all over the states come here to order. This is why San Tung is voted "Best Chinese Restaurant in America." The reason for the crowd of people in front of the place during all hours of the day. And this entree alone is enough to bring me back! They give very generous portions and these 5 dishes was enough to put our party of 5 in food coma.

KOREANS READ THIS and if you're not korean but you want to read a REAL REVIEW then read this omg seriously people? this place ISNT THAT GREAT! now if i could give a real review to this i would give it 3 stars, but i'm giving it a 1 so that it might bring a little bit of the inflation of stars down. HONESTLY SPEAKING its just one of those korean/chinese restaurants that sells jjajjangmyun, ggampoongi and jjambbong. YEAH. these are dime a dozen and littered all over santa clara county and near el camino in SJ. and those dry fried chicken wings? ITS ONLY GGAMPOONGI! and it tastes EXACTLY the same as all of the other places ive been to. theres NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT IT. i was soooo excited to try this place because i am always down to look for some delicious chinese food to eat, but when i realized what kind of restaurant this was, i was SO INCREDIBLY disappointed. their jjajjangmyun isnt even that good (black bean sauce noodles) ive definitely had better at the ones in SJ... im seriously so sad. i went to this place with great expectations because people RAVED about those chicken wings but alas... they were nothing special. also, theyre cheaper in SJ. their food was very blah and their chicken wings nothing special. i honestly DON'T know why my boyfriend went crazy over the chicken wings. he ate most of them saying they were extremely good. he's half taiwanese and half white.. and it seemed to me that the white people there enjoyed the chicken wings the most so maybe its his white side speaking. BUT he does agree with me that the food is below average and that we've had better elsewhere. DON'T FOOL YOURSELFFFFFFFFF. i mean its worth trying i guess.. to quench that curiosity over the wings.. but you will be disappointed. i assure you.

The dry chicken wings is the best like everyone mention, however the dry black bean noodles were just okay.  The noodles are al Dente (the way i like them)but the taste was average and expensive for what you get.  The pan fried pot stickers were chewy and delicious, my second fav besides the Wings would be the dry fried flounder.  YUM.  I am giving them a four because if you get there at closing on a Sunday night, you will get to smell and see them roll out the trash cans out through the door to put them out for trash pick up.  I couldn't believe they did this while patrons were in the restaurant and it didn't seem to bother anyone else.  Really trash through the restaurant while people are eating? But I was glad I have already eaten and waiting for our bill.

Five Stars Dried chicken wings (about a dozen per order, what a steal); Shrimp & leek dumplings (another dozen); even the kimchi they serve stands to be one of the best I've had! Props. Tips and Fun Facts San Tung translates to Shan Dong (a coastal region of China), who would have guessed!

If you come here and you don't order the Dry Fried Chicken Wings, then you have wasted your time waiting in that super long line to get a seat at this restaurant, buddy. They are known for their chicken wings and that's what draws the crowd. Look around at every table, I bet 90% of them have ordered those wings. What's so special about them you ask? The secret's in the sauce. I swear they put crack in it cause they've got me scooping every last bit of sauce over my rice so I can savor the flavor as long as possible. A great alternative if you don't feel like getting your hand dirty would be the Dry Fried Flounder. Same great sauce, no bones, no hands necessary, NO MESS. Other great things to order from the menu: 1. String beans: C'mon, you need some greens in your diet! (if you go during lunch, you can see one of the workers sitting in front of a massive pile of green beans and peeling/preparing them. So this dish must get ordered a lot of they always have a massive heap of string beans to be peeled.) 2. Noodles with black bean sauce: I think this is actually a Korean dish, it comes out as a bowl of noodles and a gloop of black bean sauce over it. Mix it together and you have some bomb ass noodles! 3. Shrimp dumplings: Yammy. Also, come for lunch on weekdays for their lunch specials. I believe the dry fried chicken wings are $6.50 instead of $9.50 and it comes with rice and soup of the day.

Dry Fried Chicken Wings they are worth the wait. the line gets long, have patience -trust that it is. write your name on the white board by the door and take it all in. so let's get straight to the point. everyone raves about it and so we had to try it too. the dry fried chicken wings. we had them chopped and so we wouldn't have to worry about the bones. it's like the best popcorn chicken you've ever had! crisp tangy keeps you reaching for more. eat them with a side of rice. just plain steamed will do. in fact the rice makes a perfect canvas for the delicious masterpiece. no need to get fried rice with all the extras. there is an elegance to it's simplicity. until next time cheers

I usually don't go out for Chinese food since I have a Chinese mom who likes to cook and force feed me huge Chinese feasts everyday because she secretly wants me to be really fat so guys wouldn't want to marry me and I'll live at home and be mommy's little fat girl forever... Anyway, I wanted to check out San Tung for the longest time because of its thousands of positive Yelp reviews, because of the never-ceasing lines of people waiting outside the restaurant everyday, and because my landlady kept talking about the place and I wanted to suck up more to her by having one more common topic to talk about to strengthen our bond that would hopefully eventually lead to reduced rent.  Also, I just really wanted to see what San Tung's famous dry fried chicken wings are like. It was finally meant to be one day when my lovely San Fran friends invited me and my European summer sidekick for a final dinner at San Tung.  So, I happily skipped a block and half over to the restaurant (yes, I actually lived that close, but always went for pho instead). We ordered all the signature menu items- the dry fried chicken wings (2 portions), black bean sauce noodles, shrimp and chives dumplings, and some garlic string beans. OH MY GAWD, THE DRY FRIED CHICKEN WINGS WERE AMAZING.  They were like sesame chicken on bones, except better.  Tasted so good I think I had about 11 wings swimming in my tummy afterwards. I enjoyed the black bean sauce noodles too, except it was a little messy to take and eat and I felt like a toddler with random splotches of black bean sauce around my plates and on my face. -0.5 star for service: Despite our reservation and my friend's connection to the owner, we still waited about an hour until my stomach completely emptied before we finally got our food.  Also, the waiter got me about 5 more forks when I asked for a knife to go with the fork he already brought me the first time.  But I'll round it up to 5 stars because I'm forgiving and I loved those chicken wings.

If it wasn't for my friend, I would've never discovered this place. My first time here was post 40 mile bike ride (quick tour around San Francisco and across the Golden Gate Bridge to Marin with him... And damn that makes you hungry. I have since been back multiple times, bringing friends and family alike, cause it's really that good. But I digress. The wait can be upwards of an hour or so, depending on the time of day. There's always a small line no matter what the hour, but I've seen the list grow upwards of twenty tables O.o Holy crap. On the bright side, they do turn tables around pretty quickly (be prepared to share tables with others if you're a smaller party); part of this is due to the fact that they tend to squeeze people in close (be nice to you're neighbors!). The chicken wings are a MUST here. I'm sure all the other reviews say the same thing, but it bears repeating. These are insanely good chicken wings. In fact... I would brave the lines and crowds, just to have them. I've heard that the xiao long bai are also quite good, but sadly I have not had the chance to try them... Yet. Also, try the string beans cause they're very tasty. Some of their noodle dishes are a bit hit or miss (I had one that was incredibly saucy). The only thing that keeps me coming back so often is the fact that it is a bit of a drive to get to, and parking, as usual in SF is a pain in the ass. Keep in mind it is a little bit more pricey than compared to your typical hole in the wall Chinese restaurant, but I think the food is still worth the money. All in all, service is quick, food (especially the chicken wings! On nom nom yummies) is really good, pricing is reasonable, and if you can stand the crowds, this is one of the better Chinese food places in the city!

Make sure you order the right dish!  There are various fried chicken dishes on the menu,  if you don't order the one that's the flagship dish for the restaurant, you may be disappointed.  No doubt, the famous fried chicken wing is really good.  The skin is perfectly crispy yet still juicy.  But it's on the sweeter side, for people who like spicy fried chicken, this dish, even with the spicy variation, is not remotely spicy.   The service is non-exisiting.  It could be they are always busy.  We had to use some military tactic to corner our waiter to get our children some ice waters.  The all male staff look miserable, without a single simile, make me feel bad for them.   Overall, I think it's a lot of hype.  But definitely worth trying once for the fried chicken wings.

On the hunt for some delicious Chinese food? Well look no further- love this restaurant! But, be sure to come with time to wait... I have never actually come when this place wasn't completely packed (which in my opinion says a lot about how great it is). You get big portions and prices are very very reasonable. When you come, the chicken wings are an absolute must order!

Good wings. Language barrier is rough. Ordered a bunch of food, they mistaked Mongolian beef for "cold beef tripe". Called them to correct the mistake, guy wants me to pay the difference for me to come down there and switch the order they messed up. As we discuss it, my difference goes fom $3-$3.25-$3.50-$4.00. Nice guy... If you go and don't speak Cantonese, do yourself a favor, order numbers strictly. Second time they dropped the ball.

Their dry fried chicken wings are ridiculously good.  I feel like a vampire hungry for blood when I smell those wings.  I would have given them 5 stars tonight if there were more wings than drumettes. There's always a wait time at San Tung so I recommend calling in an order and taking it to-go. When they say 20 mins, add another 10.

Kimchi. Always comes free, love me some freebies! Super yummy and delicious but also packs a punch! Dry Fried Green Beans. So good! I could eat this everyday, way to make veggies taste delicious. The stronger flavors of the sauce worked well with the natural flavor of the green beans, the green beans neutralized the flavors a bit.  Just the right amount of nommy sauce and flavor with the springy greenness of green beans. Dry Fried Chicken Wings. This is by far my most favoritest dish here ever! I could eat this everyday too! I love how crispy and sweet the chicken wings are, plus the honey and sugar in the sauce make it skin slightly chewy. It's super well-flavored and uber nommy! I've had both the dry fried chicken wings and the wet fried before but I've never been able to tell the difference, if someone knows please enlighten me because I'm literally dying to know... Potstickers. This was alright, not my fave for sure. It's just pork and lettuce and stuff inside. Didn't really think it was anything special nor anything special to write home about. The waits can be super long so come on a rainy day or a random time and you'll definitely get a table. 5 stars for nommy chicken wings and green beans that keep me craving em!

Service is typical Chinese restaurant service - not exactly rude, but they don`t exactly act like they care. I got the three deluxe spicy sauce noodles and a friend got the beef with snow peas, as well as rice [which was an $1.50]. Both the beef and the rice were really small portions - even to me, and I don`t eat much, especially when you have to pay for the rice separately. The noodles were covered in a sticky sauce that didn`t look very appetizing and certainly didn`t taste like it did either. In fact, it kind of just didn`t taste like anything. I took like two bites and couldn`t get myself to finish it. Packed it to-go and gave it to my mom to revamp.

Granted, their fried angel wings are great, the rest of the Chinese dishes can be better found elsewhere. Lunch is the only price point that makes sense for the cuisine. The client ratio is more mixed and less Asian so that gives you better sense of the dishes. Will come back only if my boyfriend is seriously craving that chicken! Otherwise, there is much more better places around there.

I have had better. Came here in a large group and ordered 6 plates of the chicken, which is their most raved about dish. I didn't enjoy the chicken one bit; salty, full of oil and drenched in their special sauce. You for sure need lots of rice with the chicken to even out the dish or lots of napkin to clean off the sauce on the chicken

I love the food and the taste is great. The downfall of this place is the lines and the wait. We got takeout but it was still 30 min wait. PLUS, we tried calling for 25 mins... no one picked up. Their chicken wings were good and hot when we first had it and the string beans were great! i guess the two typical things that people get. One day when they don't have so many people, I would love to go there and try it for realsss instead of getting togo because I can't justify reviewing for a place when I don't have the full on experience.

If I'm craving San Tung, we are going to San Tung..... I alwasy order the same dishes whenever i go here: dry fried chicken wings (usually diced), combination fried rice, string beans, and shrimp and leek dumplings....you can never go wrong with these dishes!!! TRUST!! some tips: 1. parking is a hassle here so you might be driving around for a while looking for a spot 2. it is usually busy from open to close, so be prepared to wait long if you are at peak hours like lunchtime, and after work around 530-6 until closing. make sure you put your name on the erase board on the wall at entrance for wait list. 3. service: the staff has it all down... but it's really the order your food, eat your food, pay for dinner and leave kinda place... they don't really want anyone just hanging around talking and sitting at table... they want the next group to be seated right away, and pretty much everyone that goes there understands the way they operate 4. cheap cheap cheap!!!!

We came in and there were 2 free tables but yet they asked us to put our name on the waiting list. -1 star. The menu is extensive and a little on the pricey side for lunch. We order the chicken wings which are raved about, the black bean noodles and the shrimp and leek dumplings. The shrimp and leek dumplings arrived first. They were ok - not the best I've tasted. The black bean noodles was also very average. If that's supposed to be good then clearly you don't know food. -1 star. Finally, the chicken wings were awesome - worth the admission alone as they say. This would and does warrant +1 star but is cancelled out by the fact the waiter deemed himself to know what we would prefer....I know wtf right? We ordered the wet wings because the sauce works well with rice but he brings out the dry version because he thinks we would prefer that?! I can't believe that was done and should result in -2 stars but I'll just dock one as he was apologetic. He should have asked first before changing a customer order. Leaving us with 3 stars. Average food and poor wait staff balanced by excellent wings. We will see about coming back again.

I love their wet chicken ;) Super delicious savory flavors! You must try, it is sweet with a tint of spiceness and super crunchy! Outstanding chicken wings and drumstick! Food came out really quick too. Service was great, the servers were really nice. Ordered the pork dumplings and it was fresh! Also ordered the black noodles, usually Korean places serve was good but I rather try another dish. The wait for dinner wasn't that bad, was prob 5-10 minute wait. Just keep yourself occupied so time will fly faster. We ordered another wet chicken to go for a friend and that took some time so make sure you order ahead of time so you don't have to wait again.

Nomnomnomnom. Wait. I never reviewed this place? I love this place so much. My friend said she has more pictures of their dry fried chicken wings than she does of her friends! When I go, we order the shrimp and leek dumplings, hot and sour soup, dry fried chicken wings, wet black bean sauce noodles and a kimchi noodle like dish but I forgot the name. The dry fried chicken wings taste like heaven in my mouth. Sometimes when a group of five of us go, we just order 5 plates of chicken wings with one bowl of rice. Delicious! The wait though? Go at 5 pm and skip the line. You should also drop someone off to put their name on the list while you circle for parking. Lunch is great too because they have dried fried chicken wings WITH rice for only about $6-$7. Totally worth the price!

If you are ever craving saucy fried chicken wings, San Tung is the place to be.  The table list is typically ridiculously long so either get there at an unusual time or get ready to wait it out.  Or, if you've already had the true bustling San Tung restaurant experience, head on over to the sister cafe next door.  The atmosphere is definitely different from the crowded, loud space of the actual restaurant, but it has their famous chicken wings there to order along with a selection of gelato and milk tea.

Fried Chicken + Hot and Sour soup being the wining combination. This place can be really crowded.  If you have a choice, order takeouts.  If you have party over 5, you can get dinner reservation before 5pm.   There are other dishes that are good.  The many different types of dumplings, black sauce noodles, etc.  I will suggest going with Fried Chicken and Hot and Sour soup.  If you have a bigger party, complement them with some dumplings and noodles.

Just get the wings, and nothing else (unless you're absolutely starving). They have dry-fried or wet. I personally like the wet because I like my wings saucy but most people I know swear by the dry. Either way the seasoning and sauces are pretty much the same so they're both delicious. I'd suggest take-out unless you enjoy waiting a gazillion years outside with a bunch of Chinese people. Those wings are totally worth the wait though...nom.

Perhaps we didn't order right but I was underwhelmed. The wings were sweet and fried - had better versions elsewhere. The fried flounder was very similar, except, of course, that it was fish. I'm not a big fish lover but I preferred this to the wings. The dry fried green beans were heavier than they needed to be. The black bean noodles were the least favorite dish at the table. The sizzling rice soup was very good and had s lot of white pepper in it. We sat by the door and it was crowded and cold.

The wings are pretty darn good and I'm sure I'll be ordering from San Tung again to get them. Everything else we ordered was basically average to below average.  The meat used in the Kung Pao Chicken and Sweet and Sour Pork was fatty, cartilaginous and just plain disappointing. Next time I order I'll plan on sticking with vegetarian dishes.

Kahn Souphanousinphone: From Laos, stupid! It's a landlocked country in South East Asia between Vietnam and Thailand, population approximately 4.7 million! (Hank ponders this for a few seconds.) Hank Hill: So are you Chinese or Japanese? Kahn Souphanousinphone:: D'oh! Which brings me to San Tung: Me: "Oh look, Chinese and Korean writing on the menu." (waiter walks to my table) Me: "Is this restaurant Chinese or Korean?" Waiter: "The owner is Korean born Chinese."

That being said, here's what I ordered: Sizzling Rice soup: A tasty soup, I like the different textures with water chestnut, vegetable, and shrimp. Seafood fried rice:  I'm usually not a fan of fried rice but San Tung makes a good one, moist and not overly salty.   Shrimp leek Dumplings: Ok.  Tender but a little bland-ish.  Good for grandma though. Potstickers: Biggity Bomb and ginormous. Come to papa. Cherry Pork:  a nice change of pace from sweet and sour.  No acidic flavor from pineapples or overly sweet.  Eat it before it cools, or the sauce will thicken. The famous wings:  I don't care what the waiter says, this dish is Korean.  And a very good one!  Let's call it Chinese with Korean Flavor baby! String Beans:  tasted just like...................String Beans! I hope I cleared up what San Tung is.  A Korean born Chinese Restaurant.  Best of both worlds. Like Me!

I don't think I really need to write much about San Tung cause everybody and they mama knows about San Tung and what to order from from here. 3 things I always order: Shrimp and Leek dumplings - can be plain just by themselves.  Add soysauce and hot sauce and you've got yourself an explosion in your mouth. Dry fried chicken/calamari/beef/shrimp - dry fried anything is effing delicious.  Whatever meat you choose is fried to perfection, not too crispy and never soggy.  You can order either wet or dry.  Like sauciness?  Order wet.  I personally like dry. Stringbeans - I just love stringbeans so they taste good to me regardless.  They're always crispy and flavorful and make me say "mmm" everytime I put the first stringbean into my mouth. The bubs always orders some type of noodle.  The noodles are always chewy and are extremely filling.  I'm just not crazy about any of the sauces.  On the other hand, he LOVES them. I've been coming here for a few years now and every single time I eat here, it's always been an awesome experience; good food and excellent service.

Lines are ridiculously long! But that's for a reason, of course. What draws in the crows is their dry fried chicken wings, because they are absolutely to die for.   If i were to rate the dry fried chicken wings by itself, it deserves 5 stars. But I think the rest of the dishes and service downgraded the overall rating. I think everything else is just alright though, nothing too special. I came here with a group of 5, and 6 dishes eating family style just wasn't enough. And since some of the food took a while to come, we wouldn't be getting our food anytime soon even if we ordered. And considering the price, it wasn't really worth it to spend more. We decided to just leave it as that and just go grab a teaway to actually fill us. Here's a tip, if you only want to go there for the dry fried chicken wings, there's another place called So Restaurant @ 1010 Bryant St. It tastes exactly the same, but it's on the other side of town. I heard the So restaurant owner is the son of the owner of San Tung.

I first came to San Tung a couple years back when my brother's friend brought some wings to a potluck gathering we had. They were delicious & my brother asked where he got them. My brother & sister-in-law later went here & passed along the recommendation. Since then, I've been to San Tung a bajillion times & have gotten take-out as well. DRY FRIED CHICKEN WINGS FOR THE WIN!!!!! :) You MUST MUST MUST get an order of these...what's the point of going to San Tung if you don't?! Haha. A full order comes with 12 wings. I've also tried the vegetable/chicken fried rice, which was a perfect addition to the wings. There's other things that I've tried, but don't remember the names. Very appetizing though. They have a good lunch menu. Comes with soup, steamed rice, & an entree. Service kinda sucks. They hardly check on you. You have to ask for water refills. You have to flag them down; eye-contact doesn't really work. Note: closed on Wednesdays (hump day!). Such a random day of the week, but I guess so. Metered parking & residential parking nearby. Depending on the time of day, it could be hard to find parking.

On our way to Napa, my freinds and I decided to stop off at SF to try San Tung's famous Dry Fried Chicken Wings. First off, parking was a nightmare as it took us about 40 mins driving up and down each street for a spot. There was a long line when we got there around 6pm. The wait must've been about 20 mins long and it was not fun considering SF chilly weather as we were standing by the outside doorway. When we finally got seated we ordered a few dishes to share: *Steamed Potstickers - $6.75 (3/5 stars) Steamed potstickers with ground pork, cabbage wtih ginger & garlic *Garlic Flavored Eggplant - $7.50 (3/5 stars) Eggplant braised in spicy garlic sauce *Mongolian Beef - $9.00 (3/5 stars) Sliced tender beef sauteed with red peppers & green onions *Dry Fried Chicken (wet sauce) - $9.00 (is there such thing as 6 stars?) Deep fried chicken wings in batter with garlic spicy sauce, red peppers, mushrooms and bamboo shoots. The Dry Fried Chicken wings definitely lived up to its name. It was crunchy, wet, garlicky and spicy....with perfect amount of batter. Definitely finger lickin' good!   By the time we left around 8pm, the restaurant was still jam packed and the line was even longer outside.  I shudder just thinking about standing out in the cold. But I would do it again for the Dry Fried Chicken wings!

The first bite of a San Tung Dry-Fried Chicken Wing is heavenly. Crispy skin, complemented by moist, juicy, tender chicken, swimming in a sweet, sticky sauce. Each order comes with 12 wings and is ~$10. I will say that after the sixth or seventh wing, the sauce becomes a little TOO sticky and a little TOO sweet, so I would order something else to balance the flavor of the wings. Other recommendations: Five-Spice Beef Noodle Soup - an extremely flavorful broth, with tender beef, long noodles, and spinach. The best beef noodle soup I've had in SF. Dry Sauteed String Beans - very oily, but we ordered it to feel a little "healthier" about our meal. Out of the three, I would recommend the chicken wings & the noodle soup the most. Each dish was ~$10. We ordered 2 orders of wings, the string beans, and noodle soup between 3 people and paid $15 each after tax and tip. Tip: They accept only 2 credit cards per order, and every extra one is $1.00 charge.

Amazing deep fried chicken wings with garlic honey sauce with red peppers......planning on serving this soon at one of our family's potluck dinners! My mom usually buys the fried chicken drummettes from Gourmet Kitchen in SF (the one on the left; there are 2 take-out  deli places next to each other on Stockton St. serving almost the same chicken but one is better!) but this chicken dish is much more tasty! A friend brought this to our house for a dinner so I haven't made my way to San Tung's yet, but will soon. Posting this as a reminder!

I've always dreamed of the moment that someone would finally notice my Yelp reviews, and then I could finally become a STAR!  I have very high doubts for such likelihood... especially when what I am reviewing is the same as 2000+ people before me.   OH WELL!  San Tung's ORIGINAL Dry Fried Chicken Wings are too good to not talk about.  ALTHOUGH there is nothing too "original" about the flavor profile, this establishment executes it well.  Fried with a great crunchy crust.. then coated and tossed in a sweet and sticky sauce.. and then splashed around with some dried chilies, these chicken wings are definitely worth a return trip! The other item I ordered was the Hot Braised Bean Curd, which was ONLY okay.  If the Bean Curd dish is a reflection of their other menu items, then nothing else may be worth parading about.  When you come, order the Original Dry Fried Chicken Wings, or you have no business there!! In terms of anything else: the service is quick and attentive, however, I was charged $3 for something (e.g. rice, tea, kim chi-like cold dish).  Whatever it was, I didn't order it, it was given to me.  But $3 wasn't worth the fight.  Just bear it in mind to review the check.

lets be clear about this, rarely i will wait for over 45 min to a unknown place much less a Chinese place.  That said, it was worth the wait.  That said, if you go for dinner, drop your friends off to sign up for a table as parking will drive you crazy.. or at least to drink. ;0) Food suggestions: Dry fried chicken, Hot and sour soup, string beans and ask for extra fortune cookies!  However, i would pass on the Garlic noodles that you will see everyone ordering, i found to be very plain and in dire need of vinegar. Most plates under $8 and you get a free plate of Kimchi, which oddly enough a Korean dish, but who cares as it is awesome. Oh ya, go for the shrimp and leek steamed dumplings as it is 18 of those bad ass little suckers so it is a good deal. So for 4 hungry people and beer the bill came to under $15 per person.  Not bad for a good meal!

This places passes the "line test" (i.e. If there is always a long wait, that usually means "as good as it gets") I have been coming here for almost 10 years now, it was one of the first places I ate Chinese food in SF.  Many restaurants have I visited since then, but very few can match the level of great food, price and .... great (crunchy) kim chi.  Here, the food is inspired by both Chinese and Korean sensibilities (hence, the kim chi they serve). This place is famous for the fried chicken, but I prefer the Garlic chicken, string beans, shrimp dishes.  You can't go wrong with anything you order here (unless you are on an extreme diet).  But don't take my word for it: this place has been reviewed by over 2700 Yelpers (and counting). During the weekend, expect a fairly long wait (around 30-45 min), so plan accordingly.  Try to come during off-rush hours.

This is the place to be if you like your food with sweet sauce all over it.  Pay close attention to the menu when you visit.  Every dish seems to have some kind of sauce in it.  A lot of sauce can be good because you can load up your tummy with steamed rice.  :) I know everyone loves their wings.  I'm the spicy, dry, and crispy wings kinda girl.  San Tung's wings are sticky and sweet.  Just like the way I remembered them to be when I first had San Tung's back in the early 2000's.  They are not my favorite.   I am a fan of the steamed shrimp and leek dumplings.  The fillings reminded me of Shanghai dumplings but these were wrapped in the shape of potstickers.  The green beans with pickled radish were not bad either.  Again it was covered with either oyster sauce or sweet soy sauce so you can piled onto your bowl of steamed rice.

Reservations here is a good idea, actually it is a must! This place overall was so-so, your typical Chinese restaurant.  Even with reservations we had to wait a little, and we had to make sure our name wasn't passed up.  The place itself is small and gets very crowded.  The servers weren't that friendly, except for the owner(?) who was taking shots with every other customer... Anyway, the only thing I liked from here were the chicken wings.  I'd probably just order the chicken wings to-go next time I'm ever in the area.

My friends and I came here 20 minutes before closing on a Saturday night (parking was hard to find) because we were in the city and wanted to try these super hyped up chicken wings. There were no more available tables but we were the only ones waiting .  Within those 20 minutes before closing, about 5 other parties came after us and also put their names on the waiting list. In order to accommodate everyone and not have to turn anybody away, the waiters asked the small parties of 2 if they'd be willing to share a large table with each other - kinda strange to be sitting at a table with strangers, but hey, at least you get to eat there rather than having to just get your food to-go. Already I'm liking this place because they hustled to make sure everyone was able to be seated. Once we sat down, of course we ordered the original chicken wings. We also got an order of vegetable potstickers, noodles with black bean sauce, combination fried rice, and sautéed string beans.  The food was good and not overly oily....yay! Everything was light and flavorful. I did notice a the food is on the sweeter side - for example, the sautéed string beans had a sweetness like honey rather than salty like soy or fish sauce.  Now for the chicken wings. At first bite I thought, okay well these are sweet, garlicky, and very crispy...good, but what's with all the hype? Then you find yourself grabbing another and another until you're staring at an empty plate wondering if you should order an extra order of chicken wings to-go. What's in that stuff??? LOL Overall I like this place. Good food. Accommodating. And oh, did I mention they also had Grey Goose in addition to their beer options?! :D

Yum :) Visited my Bestie in SF this weekend and she introduced me to this place as one of the places that she likes in the City. For four people, we ordered an order of dried chicken wings, pork dumplings, shrimp and leek dumplings, fried potstickers, and wonton soup. The dried chicken and pork dumplings were my favorite! The shrimp and leek dumplings were also good, but we placed that order after the pork dumplings so it had pretty hard competition. The fried potstickers were ginormous - we ended up taking most of it to go. I didn't have the actual wonton itself, but the soup was good. Overall, it was a lot of food for four people, but we wanted to try a little bit of everything due to the long wait to get our table (it was also during the time when the runners from the Nike marathon finished) and with all the highly rated Yelp reviews :)

Wow!! Was introduced to this place by fellow yelper Kristen T. who had been raving about their dried fried chicken for months upon months. We ordered their special chicken without bones and hot damn was it good. It was crispy but not burnt, flavored but not over salted, and savory with a touch of sweetness.  When I tried the chicken I was in such a state of shock that I could only say dumb cliche phrases such as "Wow! This is so good they must put crack in here!" "This is so tasty and flavorful!" and "Whoa, thanks for taking me here!" I continued raving like an idiot until we were done eating. Hmm, I guess I need to mention the other details besides the chicken to make this review complete, so just for the record: the potstickers were okay, and so was the service, price, and ambiance. All just okay. An above average place with RIDICULOUSLY delicious chicken. YOU GO NOW!

The dry fried chicken wings with sweet and savory glaze!! 10 meaty chicken wings per order, fried in a light crispy batter covered and infused with the thick, sweet and tangy brown glaze (plus I requested extra), aand there are some spicy red peppers and garlic in the mix. SO succulent and flavorful especially with rice! I would go as far as to say...ecstasy! Coming from someone who usually bypasses anything chicken. I don't care if I never try anything else at San Tung. (I did try their house noodles though. They were a bit too soft for my liking)

I had this popular place book marked since George W. Bush's first year on his second term as president. Now halfway towards Barack Obama's first term as our current leader, it took us (my daughter and I) long enough to finally have a chance to try one of the hottest businesses right now. We were the first ones to dined there and being as popular as this place is, the restaurant gets crowded quick esp. lunchtime. I would hate to imagine how crowded this place gets at dinnertime and the weekends. From the menu, we both agreed on the vegetarian fried rice and the renowned dried fried chicken wings. Except I wasn't too hungry, thus I wanted to get only six pieces (half order). But daughter wanted a dozen to take some back for mommy later on in the day. "I guess, many of you agreed on her decision." We each had a bowl of soup and a dish of kimchi. I had the kimchi and daughter drank the soup, which had tofu and eggs. I hate tofu. But she enjoyed the warm soup. Soup: http://www.yelp.com/biz_… Kimchi: http://www.yelp.com/biz_… The $6.25 fried rice dish had rice, eggs, sliced mushrooms, and a scoop of frozen pea and carrot. The fried rice had some of the pea and carrot mixture still frozen. As a result, the rice dish was very bland. Our fried rice: http://www.yelp.com/biz_… The $9.50 spicy wings tasted pretty good. The wings had a nice crispy outer layer and glazed sauce with a unique spice and flavor. With our recent experience of Bon Chon Chicken in Sunnyvale, I often questioned myself if the famous wings are classified as Chinese or Korean style. The wings are okay, but nothing too exciting. Our wings: http://www.yelp.com/biz_… My long anticipation to this place turned just acceptable. I might come here again and try the other food though.

Delicious. -The dried fried chicken wings are AMAZING. The flavor is just so good, it has a sweet and spicy taste to it and the chicken is fried to perfection. The boneless one is good too but I like the bone in better. -Not only is the chicken good but the noodles are good too, I had the spicy sauce noodles and the noodles are made fresh when you order and were super chewy and good. -The potstickers were also really good here. The inside of this place just looks like any normal restaurant, lots of seating and filled with people. Just talking about the food here is making me want to go back! You must try if you are craving Chinese food.

Worth the wait! Had the dry fried chicken wings which were a perfect combination of crispy and saucy! We have our own restaurant with "crack wings" back home in Vancouver (phnom penh) and these are just as addictive. Even at 3:00 pm when we passed by after a long walk, there was still a line! Definitely says something about the place.

Dry-fried chicken wings are of course the best. I actually really like their chow mein too (combo, veggie, pork, chicken, whatever) because it has that wok-fried smoky quality to it. Jjajangmyung, dumplings, green beans are all also staples. A bit pricey for just Chinese food, but its so worth it! Its not uncommon to see tables getting a serving of wings PER guest! Here's the routine: drive to San Tung and drop off someone at the restaurant to put their name down on the whiteboard. Spend 10-20 minutes finding parking (easier to do so if you head towards Funston, 14th etc rather than towards 10th/9th. Although you can try your luck at the free parking lot). Depending on day/time/party size, you're in for a wait of anywhere from 30 min to over an hour... You can do what I do and walk to Yancy's to chill for a bit, or you can just stay there and wait, look at what people are ordering, figure out exactly what you want so you can order quickly, etc... Or you can just phone in your order and pick it up in 30 min, no fuss!

Came here on Sat night after the 49ers vs. Oakland pregame and were lucky to grab the first spot on the wait list! Soon after, people flocked in to have their names on the list and there were 7 names after us.  We waited about 20mins before we were seated and another 10mins for the food to come out. Here is what we got: Dry black bean noodles: 5/5 Original chicken wings with the garlic sauce: 4.5/5 Combination fried rice: 4.5/5 String beans: 4.5/5 Pot stickers: 4/5 Beers: Sapporos & Anchor steam SF I can tell this is a Korean/Chinese fusion because right after we ordered, we were given kimchi (it was pretty spicy). The black bean noodles were excellent! The best that I have had, the sauce is not too thick and the taste was spot on. Normally when I get the black bean noodles at a Korean restaurant it doesn't come with any meat/veggies, but this place gives you beefs, calamari, scallops, zucchinis, cucumbers  etc (seafood was not over cooked!). I would just be happy with this dish along. The reason why I gave the chicken wings a 4.5 instead of a 5 is that it could be a little bit spicier to give it a nice kick. Overall, it was fried and sauce nicely. The skin was super crispy which is good because I don't feel too bad eating it instead had me wanting more. The sauce has a good amount of garlic, and good sweet glaze (though my girlfriend thought it was little bit too sweet for her taste but I didn't). The meat was moist and not dry, you can tell it was fresh. You can't go wrong with fried rice and pot stickers thought it was good overall. The string beans were different from the string beans that I had. It had a sweet coating and garlicky, not over cooked. I was surprise that for an Asian restaurant they don't just have Heineken! All the dishes were not greasy looking and very light on the MSG, I came out not thirsty which is first time for a Chinese restaurant, an extra plus!!  For an Asian restaurant they have good customer service, however, it is disorganized. We ordered the chicken dish and we didn't get it until almost the end of our meal, while the other tables that ordered after us received theirs first.

Bonless Fried Chicken Wings BOMB! I swear they are addicting and once you crave them nothing else will satisfy the craving so good. The Black Bean Noodles are also good so are the sauteed string beans. Come early or be prepared to wait for a while. Also keep an eye out on the white board when it gets too crowed people like to switch around names. But I would suggest ordering to go once it gets to that point.

Alright I'll join the bandwagon. My friend introduced us to this place and warned us of how long the lines and waitlist gets! So we showed up a little earlier before the lunch rush hour. +Got the dumplings which are pretty standard. +The chicken fried rice is DELICIOUS. +Beef brisket noodle soup had the most perfect noodles. It wasn't soggy. And slap on some rice in it. NOM. +Then, what everyone brags about: their dry fried chicken. My friend said that you get more meat if you asked for the diced version but I felt that was too much pow in my mouth. It's a must-eat with rice kinda dish otherwise, it's just too heavy. ... next time, we'll try the wing version! I LOVE WINGS :)

People wake up. Talk about a mass hallucination. We waited an hour to get a table. The door is open half the time with the freezing night air piling in. The food is nothing special and I won't be returning. The wings are good but so what. The rest of our meal was slop. The pot stickers were the worst I have ever had in my entire life. The black bean noodle was horrid, no flavor and the noodles were starchy. The Mongolian Beef was ok but I've had better. Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes but I was really disappointed. Definitely not worth the wait.

This place has been hyped up for me for a while now, so like a going into a movie after seeing so many trailers and having everyone tell you to go see it, I had to tell myself not to expect too much in fear of being let down. Finally went last weekend when friends from out of town were visiting - I posted a couple photos, but bottom line, get the **dry** chicken wings, that's the best thing they've got there. Everything is pretty "meh" - if you are looking for a Chinese food fix, don't get it here. This is for your chicken wing fix! Prepare for quite a wait, especially for bigger parties (groups of 2-4 got seated pretty quickly). And this is my rating for the chicken, if I factored in the other food we ordered, this could easily drop to 2.5. DRY CHICKEN!!!

Dry fried chicken wings! Boy, the wait can be rough here!  On a Sunday, there was still one party waiting for a table at 345p.  Expect an hour at peak times. But the wings are unique and worth it.  A slight sweetness (tamarind?) and spiciness with ginger and onions.  Lightly battered so crispy and juicy meat.  Heaven with a bowl of white rice! The steamed potstickers are also good.  I usually prefer fried potstickers but I think the skin is too thick and prefer the crispy skinned potstickers, whereas these get a little soggy. The black bean noodles are tasty too.  I usually don't like so much sauce but it is nice and mild.  Not my favorite dish itself, id prefer to fill up on wings and dumplings.

As if this place needed another excellent review on their dry fried chicken wings...but no joke, the best chicken wings I've ever had and i don't even usually like chicken wings. But I crave these. And you will too if you try them. The perfect thing to do when you get here is to get a dish of the dry fried chicken wings, the black bean sauce green beans, and a side of rice. Done and done. The black bean noodles are ehhhh...I would just not bother and go all in on the delicious chicken wings! Brb as I go dream about how good those chicken wings are...drool.

I honestly can't understand what the hype was all about, at all. Maybe, just maybe, if this place only sold their wings, I'd understand, but no, it's a Chinese restaurant, that failed to deliver in my opinion. Food Cons: Everything I ordered here was extremely doused in sauce. The honey walnut shrimp? It was just shrimp slathered in mayo, all I could taste was the mayo, and a shrimp texture as I chewed. They should call it, MAYO ON SHRIMP EXTREME or something. The walnuts were good though, only thing that was kept away from the mayo. I was gagging on my 3rd piece of shrimp already. (I'm not the only that noticed it, we had left overs and my friend at home had some and he thought there was a lot of mayo too.) And their beef broccoli? The waiter suggested that one to us, and boy, I've never had broccoli that soggy before, and the beef was that rubbery kind too. Blah. My only regret was getting the fried rice, instead of steamed rice, if only I had known that I would have extra mayo and beef sauce to blend out into the rice. What sad life. After munching on everything, I just wanted to throw everything into a pot of steamed rice and mix it around a little for chop suey, San Tung edition. Foodpros: Wings were good, not like OMG jizz in my pants amazing, but good enough. Sweet and appetizing. They were surprisingly crispy, even though the wings are wet. Portions, at first I thought wow, the prices are pretty hefty for Chinese food, but I guess the portions really make up for it. Who knows. If the service was world class, I'd understand their high ratings too, but it wasn't. I felt like everything was thrown down onto the table, as if they're hinting "hurry eat up, there's a family of 6 waiting" Overall, it was a 1.5 star experience for me, but I'm rounding up. And I'm pretty sure I will not be coming back on my own will, ever.

The food was good! Honestly, the food was good. At the same time, I didn't see anything particularly amazing about this restaurant. They move a lot of volume, and have a huge menu with a ton of options-- this, in itself, is impressive. I was a bit disappointed as far as flavor went, however. The chicken wings are tasty, but if we're putting this restaurant up on a pedestal because of it's chicken wings, then it might get squashed by other restaurants whose famous wings are tastier. If you're looking for a place to take a group of people and you're craving Korean-Chinese, this is a good option. I am hesitant to say it is the best, though, because I have to think there are other places where *all* of the dishes stand out. And now for a fantastic recipe for chicken wings! In a large pan with a lid, dissolve: - 1/4 c brown sugar - 1/4 c corn oil (although you probably don't need this much) - 1/4 c soy sauce - Minced/grated ginger - Minced/grated garlic Add 2 lbs chicken wings/drumsticks, bring to simmer, turn heat down, and cover. After 10 minutes turn the chickey wings over, cover again, and cook until finished (about another 10 minutes). Garnish with sesame seeds and/or sliced green onion. Note: Double sauce recipe for extra saucey sauce. Mmm mmm. Sticky Asian-ey chicken wings. Or tofu.

San Tung should just close their restaurant and sell their dry fried chicken wings out of a food truck. Like everyone else says, the dry fried chicken wings are superb. Sweet, tangy, salty, crispy and a million other words that you could use to describe how great they are. Unfortunately, their other menu items are just sort of mediocre. The black bean noodles, which is one of my favorite Chinese dishes of all time, were bland, which was surprising because they were drenched in sauce. The cucumbers, which are supposed to add a crunch and a cool refreshing bite to an otherwise salty and savory dish, did absolutely nothing because of how little they put in comparison to the amount of noodles and sauce they give you. The pork dumplings were dry, not even a single drop of delicious soup made it inside. I had to dunk these in copious amounts of soy sauce. The chicken and string beans (a dish that I have to order pretty much at every single Chinese restaurant I go to) were pretty good. The flavors were good and there was that tasty residual sauce that clings to everything, but the green beans were too crunchy and didn't have the darker, more shriveled, but still crunchy, appearance of places that serve up delicious dry sauteed string beans. Fortunately, the dry fried chicken wings are delicious enough to make up for everything else. I would definitely come back, but would probably just order some chicken wings and rice.

"I want some crack!" I feel like Tyrone Biggums was referring to this place whenever he yells that line. I sometimes get two (read: 2) orders of the dry fried chicken because they're like crack and I'm a fatass. The wait is long, and you sometimes get the pushy asian women who shove their way past you to grab the marker to put their name down. Minus that, this place is purty dayam good. P.S. Peter, the taller, skinnier server with the glasses, is the bomb. Really, all the waiters here are spot on: quick, perceptive, just spot on.

At first I wanted to resist, but you just love that Honey BBQ with asian spicy flavor. I mean if you think about it, that's ALL they really have. All their "famous" dishes taste the same. But it's so damn good. Don't have it too much though, I went to San Tung 3X in a month and got a little tired of that same flavor. If you go here. MUST GET: 1.  Dry fried Chicken wings 2. Dry Fried Beef 3. Green beans Done and done.

[#74 - original dry fried chicken] I've had the chicken wings at So in Soma, and was asking myself how much better can it possibly get? They use some type of dry better (guesses are corn starch, rice flour?) and coat it perfectly with a sauce which isn't too intense. The other items on the menu are kinda your traditional chinese fare, but the original dry fried chicken is off the wall.

I'm gonna start out by saying that I'm not a fan of fried food in general, but the wings were really juicy and flavorful. The reason San Tung is only getting 3 stars is because everything else we ordered was just okay/not that good. For 2 we came by on a Saturday at around 11:30am, right before a line formed. We ordered: - #9 Combination spicy soup noodles - the BF really liked this, I thought it was just as good as the soup at Korean noodle places (that also serve black bean noodles). Good, but not really something I couldn't get elsewhere - Combination cold plate - beef tripe and pig's ear - normally I really like the cold plates at Schezwan restaurants but the ones here weren't flavorful and had a weird aftertaste. After a few bites, I felt grossed out. - #74 Dry Fried Chicken - no explanation needed. - #114 Garlic Flavored Eggplant - this was really sour and not very good. I normally love eggplant at Chinese restaurants but this was disappointing.   Would I come back? Probably for the chicken, but I would try other things different than what I listed above.

Does it really matter if I write one more review of how awesome the chicken wings are here?  You know you want to try it.  You see all the 4 and 5 star ratings.  You're thinking to yourself..."will any of these reviews  dissuade me from coming here?"  The random ratings under 4 stars are for those who hated the long ass wait (no joke) and had too high of an expectation of what really is some good flavored, tasty, satisfying chicken wings.  My 4 star rating is really just for the chicken wings which, let's face it, is probably the only reason you landed on this page.  The rest of the food here is...meh.  Go ahead and try it...you know you want to.   P.S.  Making reservations helps.

After many of my friends suggested coming here, I finally made it out for lunch today!  Parking was such a drag, and we drove around for about 10-15 minutes before we found a spot.  It wasn't too crowded today, maybe because it was around 1:30pm after the lunch rush, and we didn't have to wait for a table. 1. Dry Fried Crisp Wings - 5 stars!!!!! -SO GOOD!!!! I've always been a fanatic for great chicken wings, and this is now my new favorite place to come to (others are SO and Buffalo Wild Wings).  Th texture of these wings are great because they're crispy, yet soft at the same time, and the sauce that they pour over it is soooo good (sweet and tangy and garlicy goodness).  Plus, there's TWELVE of them!  What a deal! 2. Black Bean Sauce Noodles - 3.5 stars -My family used to always make this when I was little, and I think the one here is just mediocre.  Although the sauce wasn't too overwhelming, and there were freshly sliced cucumbers, shrimp, onions, and some other veggies in here, I think I wish it still had a little more of it since most of the bites I had were 99% noodle, when I was hoping for a little more vegetable.  This is probably just my preference. 3. Shrimp and Leek Dumplings - 4.5 stars -minus 0.5 stars for not incorporating very much shrimp, and mostly leek into the dumpling...however, it was definitely home-made and authentic! You can tell home-made dumplings from the store-bought type that you see in the frozen section at grocery stores when after you cook the dumplings, they become shriveled up with a wrinkly texture, and the edges of the dumplings are completely perfected rounded.  Plus the flour/dough they used to make these dumplings look freshly made also from scratch, like the kind my family makes. I can't wait to come back to this place again for more wings and more delicious Shan Dong food! p.s. You KNOW it's authentic and fresh when you see a bunch of guys sitting around the large round table in the back with a HUMONGOUS PILE OF GREEN BEANS, cutting off the ends of each one. :) http://www.yelp.com/biz_…

San Tung has:    * Four stars and 2310 (now, 2311) reviews on Yelp;    * 2,500 check-ins on foursquare;    * 250 votes and a 88% "like it" rating on urbanspoon. Why so raved about?  Four words, my friends: Dry Fried Chicken Wings.  San Tung places chicken wings on a whole, other level.  In addition to crack chicken, they're known to serve delicious jja jang myun, more familiarly known as black bean noodles.  While I'm sure the many other dishes on the menu serve decent (and probably very Americanized) Chinese food, the chicken and the black bean noodles seem to be everyone's top faves.  And rightfully so.

I can't believe how CROWDED this place gets!  Be prepared to wait... The main items to get here are the chicken wings and string beans.  The potstickers are pretty good, but I wouldn't say it's my favorite item (a little too meaty and not enough of the dough to go around).  Dry noodles (zha jiang mian) and soup-y noodles are good, but I don't think the noodles are hand-made.  Home-made kimchi was surprisingly spicy, but good.

Very rarely will come a time when I give 5 stars just for one dish And no, it's not or beef, pork, or some exotic fish It's for their dry chicken wings When you bite into it, your taste buds will sing Granted, been here before and had their dumplings And man, I tell ya, they were something. Tasty and delicious, the prices are hard to beat If you're in the city, this is the place to eat. One note during dinner, this place gets CRAZY busy, so make sure you go there early.

It was a rainy San Francisco day when I chose to isit San Tung and I couldn't believe the line snaking out the door and halfway up the street. I was fortunate that someone pulled out of a parking space directly in front of the restaurant so I added my name to the board in front and waited in my car for thirty minutes. When my friend and I were seated, we went overboard ordering to make that wait worthwhile. The restaurant is no intimeate dining spot. Conversation was impossible with the cacaphony taking place. There are at least fifty tables. Everyone seemed to order the crispy friend chicken wings which we very good in some sort of sweet sauce. I wasn't as impressed with the shrimp and leek dumplings ( I've had so much better ). The chicken won ton soup was delicious - excellent broth - and it certainly hit the spot on a cold, rainy San Francisco day. The combination chow mein, chock full of mushrooms, vegetables and seafood was good as was the "Happy Family" - stir fried beef, chicken, shrimp, calamari, scallops, mussels, broccoli, zucchini, black mushrooms and baby corn in a spicy sauce. Who wouldn't like that combination! We also ordered a shredded porl in garlic sauce, just a hint of spice and some wonderful fungus that was very tasty. Add that to a beef and broccoli dish and, of course, we couldn't finish half of it. I was eating leftover for dinner that night and lunch the next day! Good food, definitely, and it was nice not to brave the Chinatown crowds. I certainly considerd it worth the wait. Visited November 2011 Value

San Tung is one of the few restaurants that both my mom and I will consistently agree on for grabbing lunch. At any time of day this place is ALWAYS ridiculously crowded, but it's definitely worth the wait. We always get the Dry Fried Chicken and Shrimp & Leek Dumplings, everything else we order is pretty much a secondary choice. The service is pretty good for a Chinese restaurant in the city, the servers are serious about turning the tables quick, but not pushy about it.

The lines are long, so the trick is to go there early - like 11:30a for lunch. That way you can get seated right away.  Their dumplings are the best way to go!  Both the pork and shrimp/chives are delicious.  I like their wrappers because they are soft and a little chewy.  We usually order 1 dumpling per person! We don't eat much of anything else when we come here, but here are some of the other dishes that are also good: Fried dry Chicken wings Chow Mein Pan Fried potstickers Ja-jeung mein (noodles with black bean sauce) ========== Review #157

I've gone to this place a lot of times and I still can't get enough of their dried fried chicken wings (whole not the cut up ones) and their green beans. sooo sooooo good. however, what made this visit even more special was ROB LOWE. yes, ROB LOWE was there and we (me and 3 other people I was with) got to take pics after he was done eating (we didn't want to be too rude now :P ) even after moving to NY there is NOTHING that can compare to these wings :)

I'm surprised I haven't reviewed this place yet. Yes, it's worth the hype! These wings really are smothered in crack sauce. I love how their dried fried chicken wings USUALLY have a great crisp, and the skin isn't fluffed in a huge batter or anything. The string beans are great as well. You can look at them being picked at the round table of mountain piled beans. I wish they delivered though...but that would probably be impossible with the amount of orders they'd get.

The first time I ate at San Tung was around 1998 or so and I remember that the Srimp and Leak dumplings being really good. So when I was in this area of the city, I wanted to try them out again.  Had the dumplings which were pretty much just like I remembered, coming to the table steeming hot.  Just dip them in a bit of soy and a bit of vinegar and enjoy,,,yum. We also had kung pao shrimp and a fried chicken dish that the waiter suggested.  The latter dish did not come with veggies, just chicken pieces that were coated in flour, fried and some sweet sauce added. I'm not a fan a chinese restaurants that dump a thick sweet sauce on veggies and meat.  If you want that, you can get it fairly cheap at Panda Express which is not bad when you want quick chinese food. Try Hong Kong Flower in Millbrae, I haven't been there in a while but when I have in the past, they did not smother the food with a sweet sauce.

WOW their spicy fried chicken wings are so good, you'll want to eat until you can't, and then still want to take some home with you.  I prefer the dry wings, but the wet version is also delicious.  Also their black sauce noodle is freaking awesome, I can't remember what its called, but it's the one with all the black sauce on it. Other things I tried range from good to mediocre, but the two dishes named are worth the four stars!   The service is not fantastic, the wait times can be long, and parking is a pain - but those wings just keep everyone coming back!

NOM NOM NOM!!! Oh my goodness! That dry fried chicken is amazing! First initial bite, the cripsy, sweet, tangy fried chicken took over my taste buds! They must've put a lot of sugar in that sauce though cause that thing literally gets stuck to your teeth! And it actually takes some effort to get it off! And the seafood fried rice. I didn't believe my friend when he said it was hella "wet" hahah and it was!! How can fried rice be juicy!?!?!? I don't know. But you gotta try it!

Potstickers = HUGE potstickers. these were ok. Wet fried chicken - good, tasty, and just a little more saucy. Pork Dumplings - yummy! Dry Black Bean sauce noodles - omg so good!

My boyfriend and I heard so much about this place that we had to try it. When we went it was hard for us to find the place, then soon realized it was getting renovated; but lucky they temporarily moved it to the gelato place next door. Found out that the gelato place was the son of the owners of San Tung, and the original cook of San Tung! The wait was okay, cause it IS a ice-cream place. We ultimately came for the original dry chicken that everyone raved so much about and ordered the string beans with rice. DELICIOUS. However after a few chicken wings you'll get sick of it cause it was so sweat but definitely tasty. The reason for the 4 stars however was the sitting arrangements, we were sitting in a table for two facing each other, then there was a man sitting by himself FACING/STARING right at us eating while HE ate. Which was uncomfortable for my boyfriend. Overall will come again when they are done renovating their orginal restaurant.

I went here for the first time today, and I was pretty satisfied. It might just be some of the best Chinese food I've had state-side. And like everyone else says, this place is ALL about the dry fried chicken (which is, in fact, wet and sticky - go figure). Get anything else and you will be okay - satisfied. But if you want to be more than satisfied - happy, ecstatic even, make sure to get the dry chicken wings. Even after they were done I was scooping the sauce onto my fried rice. The only thing to beware of is that this place is BUSY. They don't take reservations, and on a friday night this place was bustling, with people spilling out the door. Plan a little extra time to get a table, and send a scout in early to get on the list, if possible.

If you are ever in Sunset and you find yourself craving for delicious Chinese food, stop by San Tung! Write your name on the whiteboard and cross your fingers that it won't take any longer than 30 minutes to get a table... the longest I waited was 50 minutes for a table of 3 on a busy, crowded Friday night. I went on a Tuesday night at 8:00 and waited for 30 minutes for a table of 2. The Dry Fried Chicken Wings dish is the most popular item on the menu, and it is easily one of the most flavorful chicken wings I've ever had. It's a nice balance between sweet and tangy, and it comes out hot and crispy. Highly recommended! I find myself craving these wings ALL the time now. The dried sautéed green beans were also very tasty. On two separate occasions I tried the soups. The tomato egg soup was very good. The service here is really fast, essentially because because the wait staff really wants to get you in and out as soon as possible in order to accomodate the crowd of people waiting to get a table. This is a no-frills restaurant... just really good food. If you want to take your date to somewhere romantic, then look elsewhere... but if you want delicious Chinese food and you don't mind the atmosphere, look no further! It really is as delicious as they say.

My iPhone finally checked me in right as I walked into a locked door with a huge "CLOSED WEDNESDAYS" sign that I am pretty sure I would have seen if the damn phone didn't take forever to process.  I parked on 9th and walked in the cold for this?! I was really looking forward to snort the crack-laced wings that everyone and their moms are raving about, but I guess I'll just have to wait for my next fix; I drove back on Irving, saw a friggin KFC and started having withdrawal symptoms. Not a problem.  My own dumb fault of course.  Will leave 4 stars for now to not affect an apparently amazing establishment's rep, but will come back on a non-Wednesday to seal the deal.  peace

Dumplings noodles, dumplings noodles! I LOVE San Tung!! Shanghai food at its best :) *heart heart*!! Dumplings: I love ALL their dumplings here, fried or steamed. The pork one is my favorite (steamed), but the shrimp and leak one is also a very good alternative (for you vegetarians out there). I always get their fried pork ones as well, but they are HUGE, so don't order too much of it. Wings: Everyone gets their Chicken wings here. I'm not a huge chicken wings fan so maybe thats why I'm not crazy about them, but people go NUTS over them. You've got to try them once .. just dont blame me if you get addicted to them :) Noodles: OMG where do I start?? Their dry black bean sauce noodle is VERY good, but its not exactly like ja jern meen if that's what you're looking for, but still VERY tasty. Noodles with peanut sauce is one of my favorites. It has nuts, seafood, green peas, and a very thick pasted sweet peanut sauce on top. The three delux spicy noodle sauce is also very tasty if like spicy food. The beef soup noodles is BOMB - moneyyyy! I've also tried their ma po tofu (spicy) and I couldnt finish it because it was too spicy, but it was good :)

A friend of mine raved about this hole in the wall in the Inner Sunset/Golden Gate Heights area of San Francisco. The dry fried chicken is so good, that you can't stop eating it! I don't normally like sweet sauces, but theirs was exceptional! The recipe is online and my brother made it for Christmas, but it's never totally the same! If you're ever in the area, try it, but be prepared to wait a bit for a table. We were there for a late lunch on a Sunday and the wait was no more than 30 minutes, which is not bad at all. With 4 kids, however, it feels twice as long!

My personal mantra at San Tung: Wings first. Gym later. As such, the best four words of advice that I can give to anyone that goes here: Order. The. Chicken. Wings. Sure, the other items I've tried on the menu are good (the black bean noodles, steamed pork dumplings, and sauteed string beans), but for me, it's ALL about the wings. Crispy, deep-fried, and covered in a savory sweet-gingery-garlicky sauce, you'd be a fool to pass these up. Whenever I go to San Tung with my friends, I can't help but notice the chatter die down at our table as the number of chicken wings on our plate quickly dwindles to a single piece. Now typically, I'm the type of person that is nice enough to let my friends fight over the last bit of anything on food we share, but when it comes down to the last piece of a San Tung chicken wing, I do NOT hold back. I will fight tooth and nail (and fork) to have that last wing, and NO ONE will stop me. (joking, sorta) But honestly, these wings are so GOOD that I'm not ashamed to look like a total fatty in front of my friends and ask for that last piece. Most important things to note: 1. Parking around Irving, no matter how early (or late) never fails to suck. I suggest dropping off your family or friend(s) at this place while you park so that they can hold a table or write down their name on the waiting list. 2. If there happens to be a wait (which there typically is), the waitlist is located on the right of the door on the wall when you enter. Just write your name and number of people on the whiteboard and wait outside to be called. 3.The bathrooms here are clean - which is especially good to know since you'll most likely need to wash off that sticky chicken wing sauce from your hands after your meal.

First off, me and my friends were seated at a table that we had to share with another group. Kinda weird because it had one of those spinning things in the middle, so I was how we are gonna do this? But it was like whatever, cause the group that we sat with didn't talk much. They give you hot tea, and an appetizer, which was kinda of like kimchi but I felt like the lettuce wasn''t super pickled like kimchi normally was, but it was okay and SUPER SPICY NO JOKE. okay not like death spicy but BAM that was spicy. When the waiter took our order, I felt a bit rushed, i did, but I guess its normal because asian restaurants are always fast paced. It was our first time here and we didn't know what to order, so we just decided to order two plates of chicken, when we told the waiter he was kind of like rude. He said we had two each order a minimum seven dollar plate, with an attitude. I was like okay we didnt know, cause they didn't say that anywhere on the menu, or not that I saw. But, after all that mess, we ended up ordering 3 plates of the chicken wings (2 dry and 1 wet), and a bowl of those black bean noodles. Let me say, that chicken was AMAZING, no joke, cannot even compare to wingstop and smokeeaters, it was so crunchy and the sauce was relish, for the dry one. The wet was good too, but I prefer the dry way more because of the crunchiness. We were all sad, because we felt like we shouldve just order four plates of dry chicken wings. The black bean noodle thing was alright, the flavor was not really there. But those chicken wings dude, you guys gotta try it, it is crazy (DRY DRY CHICKEN WINGS). Haha dry and wet sounds weird right? They shouldve described it as saucy and crispy :)

Close to an hour wait for a table of 6. Salivating as we stood in line surrounded by plates of chicken wings. The chicken wings were very tasteful, sweet, and a bit tangy..reminds me of General Tsao Chicken/Dry Braised Chicken/General Chicken put together...(my family used to own a mandarin/szechuan restaurant so I found this sauce to be a similar combination to all of those dishes listed above) We compared the chicken wings (with bones) to the chicken cutlets (no bones) and came to a mutual conclusion that the ones with the bones are WAY better! Cutlets are for those that enjoy heavily battered chicken. Black bean sauce noodles were okay, could barely taste the flavor. Would not recommend the veggie dumplings! And the only sad thing was that they brought out our green beans after we finished ALL of our entrees so it was pointless to eat a side dish last. Kim Chi complimentary starter was a plus! All in all, the chicken wings are very delicious and the aroma will get you for sure!

I went there on a date and even though the wait was horrendous, the food was delicious.  I got there 10 minutes early because I'm used to riding my bike over there and overestimated the amount of time that was needed.  Thank goodness I got there when I did because it took 40 minutes to be seated.  I remembered it had a long wait but I didn't think would that bad at 8pm. I ordered dried fried chicken (of course!) and he ordered. Mongolian beef.  I was too nervous to really eat, which is kinda sad because I can out eat a lot of people for my short body.  I don't know.  It just felt like a lie.  The food is consistently good and waiters are bit pushy.  It kinda adds to the ambiance of the place. I also got the leftovers so score for me!

The original dried fried chicken/ shrimp is sooo good. If you want chinese food, this place will def satisfy. Although the service wasn't the best, but the food makes up for it. Next time I go, I'm gonna try a different dish. The place is a little cramped and the wait is pretty long during peak dinner hours. However they're gonna do a remodeling so hopefully they free up the place a bit. Prepare to look hard for a parking spot during peak dinner time!

Wings are one of my favorite things to eat.  Fried, salt & pepper, buffalo, cajun, you name it, I'll eat it.  I don't know why it took me so long...After 4+ years of living in the bay, I finally made it to San Tung for the highly raved Dry Fried Chicken Wings.  We must have gotten lucky because we only waited for half an hour tops for a table and we didn't have to share our table with strangers.   I of course studied the menu prior to coming so I knew exactly what I wanted to order.  One order of the famous wings, Ja Jyung Mein and String Beans.  I munched on the complimentary Kim Chee while I eye raped other people's food on their tables. The string beans were the first to arrive and as I bit into the first string bean I was NOT blown away.  Overcooked and the flavor was a bit too sweet.   At least the Ja Jyung Mein (black bean sauce Korean noodles) lived up to the hype.  Best Ja Jyung Mein I've had so far (not saying much since this is only the 2nd place).  Tasty black bean sauce with shrimp, pork and fresh julienned cucumber topped home made noodles.  It's a very simple dish and can be a complete failure if the sauce is tasteless.  It just looks like a pile of goop if you don't know how to eat it.  You have to mix the noodles and the sauce together before eating.  I really loved this dish as the sauce was tasty and the noodles were perfectly chewy and al dente. The wings finally arrived at our table and I was salivating just looking at it.  It's a beauty as you can see the crispy batter on the wings and the famous salty, spicy, sweet sauce mixed with ginger, garlic, and red peppers glazed over the wings giving it a delicious looking shine.  They tasted as good as they looked.  Perfect crunch, delicious taste, moist and juicy.  What amazed me the most was how well the crispy crunch held on the wings.  Even towards the end of the meal, the wings were still crunchy even though there was sauce on them.   We finished every wing and the whole bowl of Ja Jyung Mein.  The plate of string beans looked untouched.  I've definitely had better elsewhere.  But why 3 stars only?  As good as these wings are, they get a little heavy and I can't see myself craving them as other people do, deeming it the nickname "crack wings".  Based on the beans, I have a feeling that most of their menu other than the wings & noodles are going to be mediocre.  Until the next time I crave "crack wings" and try other things on the menu, my stars will remain at 3.

I have been going to this place for so many years now but now that I am finally on the yelping scene, I'll write my review. Let's start off with the service. One of the servers loves us and he always asks how we are doing and bringing us a bowl of soup! Food: Dry Fried Chicken: Here is a little secret in ordering the dry fried chicken. Most people order it wings but I love ordering it diced. It seems like there is so much MORE chicken for diced! Pork dumplings: these little buggers are full of flavor and so delicious. The best sauce for this is: 2 parts soy sauce, 1 parts vinegar and a splash of chili sauce for a little pzazz. Chicken fried rice: the chicken is very moist and not dry at all. The portion is pretty decent as well. The only thing I can say bad about this place is that there are so many people that it takes a while during lunch and dinner hours.

On cold and foggy Bay Area nights, I sometimes recall and recount tales of this place's chicken wings.  I don't even like chicken wings.  But, here, I do.   I've brought friends to San Tung.  I've brought family to San Tung.  Never has there been a place so universally liked.  We've been there several times, and most of the menu is good fare, but not amazing.  I don't think we've ever ordered something we didn't like or thought was bland, which is unusual.   For most of the dishes, 3.5-4 stars would suffice.  The food is a little more authentic than your average Chinese place -- you'll find fewer of the typical brown and clear sauces, which are instead replaced with more flavorful, if similar-looking, counterparts.   But...those wings.  I've ordered wings at other places and the lack of meat/flavor on them usually disappoints.  Not here.  The flavor is so heavenly that you've got to wonder whether they came from chickens....or perhaps from some sort of divine winged creatures... Probably the best Chinese food I've had in either SF or LA.  Only one place could have compared overall dish-wise (nothing compares to San Tung's wings), and it's Great China in Berkeley (currently closed due to a fire, set to reopen sometime in 2013).  They're very different places, though, and it's hard to compare the two.

I absolutely heart this place. I loooveeee the dry fried chicken wings but who doesn't when they come here.  Although I hate the wait.  I always order takeout here because the wait is completely horrendous.  No reservations either. A good time to probably go is during lunch, it never seems as busy and they have a lunch menu too (cheaper is always better).  I also always get the Peanut noodles, which are also amazing!!!!!

Dry Chicken Wings - Hell yes x 100.   - They are still covered in sauce so they are not "dry".  But what makes them extra awesome is that they are still crispy underneath.  The wet ones are not crispy thus dry is better. Everything else is pretty good here with large portions.  But what makes this place constantly have a huge line outside is the wings.  If it is place is packed and the line is gigantic just order some dry chicken wings to go and you will still have a magical day.

I've been to San Tung many times, and I've always gone for the Dry Fried Chicken Wings.  I've had the "Wet" wings before, but they were never as good as the dry ones.  Today, I went in for lunch with a friend, and we got one order of each and -- dare I say it -- the wet ones were better this time!  I loved the Dry ones still, but today the wet ones were extra good.   I recommend you all go and try some of both!!

I don't have a lot of experience with chinese food, but the chinese food that i do have experience with is often greasy, with strange cubes of hot pink colored meat, and the alluring scent of msg wafting up from the plate. San tung is NOT that. I ate here for the first time on saturday and ate so much that i had to pull thee old unbutton-the-top-button of-the-pants trick in order to breathe.  We had: two orders of the amazing chicken, mu shu pork, sizzling rice soup, green beans, sweet and sour pork, braised flounder, curry beef, and some other things i can't even remember, and it was AMAZING. We showed up at 11 a.m. when it opened, and by the time we left around 12:30 there was a large line out the door, and i can see why. Thanks for finally showing me what good chinese food is, San Tung.

San Tung has many great dishes, but let's be real, their true treasure is the original fried dry chicken wings. The marinade on the chicken is a perfect balance of sweetness and flavor. Perfect with white rice and a plate of vegetables. Their customer service is speedy and accurate. The line may be out the doors sometimes but people come in and out quick. San Tung is a must try for people who love chicken wings. I've never tasted anything quite like it.

When you walk in the door of San tung, they ask you "how many?" with a look that says "why the f@ck are YOU here, you as$hole?" Seriously. Never have I been somewhere with such rude service. The wings ARE great as is the mu shu. At this point, to me the rude service is part of the price if you want those amazing sticky wings. One time the waiter knocked over my friend's soda with his elbow, spilling it all over her. He rolled his eyes at her and looked at her like it was her fault. no apology. No effort to help her out. But seriously the food is really good. Be prepared to wait a long time on busy nights.

SAN TUNG, famous for the dry chicken wings and that they should.   I use to come here quite often with my friend when i was still living in the city, but why did I not review this place earlier? well better late than never.. right?! My recent trip here was with a few first timers(sister and cousins).. came here around dinner time and you know what dinner time means (hard to find parking and a long wait) :( but it was all worth it you can't expect much in customer service, but this is where their dishes make them. to be exact its their ..... DRY chicken wings which are delicious! we also got the WET chicken wings, hmm good but not comparable to the dry. black bean noodle... another delicious item on the menu and since we wanted to order some greens we got the sautee green beans and the broccoli beef dish. :) all this between 4 girls? yikes! we definitely over orders! but you gotta love family style! plenty of left overs for sure.

They could work on the customer service a bit more.  Outside of that the wings are as good as people in other reviews have said.  I came in around 2 and had to wait for about 15 minutes for one.  I ended up being seated at a large table with an older couple and another individual but that was cool.  I ordered the dry wing lunch combo which include rice, 8 wings, and a small hot & sour soup.  They can have the soup because it tasted horribly bland.  No amount of salt and pepper could save it.  The complementary kimchi was really tasty.  In addition to the wings, I also got the shrimp and leek dumplings.  That was a favorite also.  Maybe next time I'll try the string beans dish (forgot the name of the dish).  Once again really good wings, I had to order some to go for later.  Definitely will return when I'm in the area.  Thanks Jimmy C. for the recomendation.

If you have read other reviews (and my previous one)... after all these years, I still can't find anything better than their chicken wings.  During Christmas time, I went there again and found out those special chicken wing comes in nuggets!  Say hey!  Great news for lazy bum like me.  No more bone chewing (My sons both agreed). Interesting enough, my son really like the chicken fried rice.  I'd like to recommend it as well since it does some how taste different and taste pretty good... especially when freshly served.  Must be the MSG. The noodle is awesome!  I've mentioned the noodle was average and frankly, the soup base is kind of average but the texture is awesome!   I've been around to many noodle shops, this one has one of the best texture EVER!  You know what I mean if you have tried it.  Not soggy, in fact, kind of Al dente.  I loved it!   Service is so bad... and the place is so busy... I just hope take out does taste as good.  One thing I do want to point out, I've ordered these wings for take out a few times, ask them to put the sauce aside, so you can still toast up the chicken and heat the sauce at home... pour it in, just like fresh made.   Bon Appetit

Dried fried chicken FTW! I followed my sister who lived in SF for a couple years to this Chinese restaurant in the Sunset area. It's right across the street from another Chinese restaurant but what makes this stand out is the dried fried chicken. The best way for me to describe it is a spicier version of Korean fried chicken drumettes. One order is good for 2-3 people, depending on how hungry you are. We also got the string beans and noodles with beef. The second time around, I had my son with me so he just ate the noodles because he doesn't like spicy. It gets crowded so be prepared to wait and even share a round table. But it'll be worth it.

San Tung is my favorite chinese restaurant in the inner sunset. Every single time I come here I never walk away unsatisfied. Our group favorites include the hot and sour soup, the vegetarian dumplings, mongolian beef, kung pao chicken, and of course the famous dry fried chicken wings. Usually when I love a place once I go back and its not the same as my memory served. But this place always lives up to my fat kid memories. The service is speedy. And do not expect to be pampered. They want you in and they want you out. But do not be turned off by this. Its a common occurrence at chinese restaurants. Expect to wait in a long line if its lunch or dinner. Be it a Tuesday or a Sunday. We once waited 2 hours on Christmas Day to get a table. Parking is a tuffy so carpool if you can.

What can I say that hasn't been said 899 times before me? This is my favorite (on-the-cheap) chinese restaurant that I have tried so far and I usually eat here at least 3 times a month. Just like every other review, I can't walk into this establishment without ordering the Dry Fried Chicken, although I order it DICED, rather than the WINGS. I'll try the Wings one of these days. Their Mongolian Beef is very tender and so damn good! I haven't tried anything else on their menu because when I'm there I must have the aforementioned items. I think this may actually be the most boring review that I've ever written. Sorry It's snot funny

San Tung is one of the few places in the Inner Sunset, outside of Ebisu - that consistently has a line outside of it. It could be raining, freezing, or a slow weekday - and San Tung is still bursting with eager eaters - pining for their dry fried chicken wings. There isn't much to be said for ambiance, you'll probably find yourself sharing a table with people you've never met before, and the waiters will probably unleash some attitude with your food, but San Tung may just be worth the hassle. Their menu is extensive - and you really can't go wrong with the veggie dumplings, the chicken wings, the string beans, the sizzling rice soup, the homemade noodles, and the pot-stickers. Just be sure to come with an open mind about the wait, study up the Yelp reviews - before you step inside, and don't forget your appetite.

I'll kick your ass! I got my ass kicked! You kick ass! Those 3 lines are totally different. It took me long time to find out that "ass" and the "kick" meaning. And the 3 lines really well with the word like "FXXX" or "SHIT". Using "FXXX" was very difficult for me too. So, I didn't know "KickAss" can be able to use as an adjective. But when I eat the 5 spices beef noodle soup, I said, " WHAT A KICKASS noodle soup!!!" Talking about craving, a powerful desire for Great Flavor. The noodle is THE BEST Chinese noodle makes me feel a powerful desire for. The broth was really Hot, dark, has such a deep rich and thick but not too heavy taste, PERFECT. The Flat egg noodle was al dente, PERFECT. The Flesh spinach was NOT OVER COOKED even the soup was really hot, PERFECT! The 5 spiced Beef,  OMG it's Suji-Niku! nicely cooked, tender, thin sliced, PERFECT. How do you say Suji-niku in English? The store is very clean. The wait staff are very good and sharp. Great Awesome Food. The Best noodle ever. They serve free KimChee flavor cabbage. it was good. I really felt that finding a root of Real Asian cuisine here, including Japanese. I can't wait to go back. It's a KICKASS noodle soup! The noodle KICK your ASS really well. This place KickAss. This place Kick your Ass. You'll get ass kick..... no..... No, No. I just want to say that I am happy, so happy to find a great Authentic Chinese restaurant, that's all. For more info, see Ken K's KICKASS review. Btw, Ken K said, "Suji-Niku" - roughly speaking probably tendon meat. I used to think it was "meat near the bone" but probably flank cut that has strips of tendon inside is more accurate. Probably closest thing to suji nikomi, but Chinese version with noodles. Sushi Sam's does a good suji nikomi appetizer, very pricey, small portion, but sexcellent (his wife makes it). OHHHH, Suji-Nikomi!!! That's Dote-Yaki in Osaka, Japan!!!

It's da Beef-No' Guy here! If San Tung got into a fight with the Superfriends of Chinese restaurants of Yank Sing, Ton Kiang, Just Won Ton, King Of Won Ton,  House of Nan King (H.O.N.K), Panda Express (PanEx), PFC (PF Chang's), Yan C*nt (Martin Yan's chain),  San Tung could take them all with one hand tied behind his back, use his other hand to execute a Street Fighter HADOKEN fireball and OBLITERATE their a$$e$ into oblivion.                     O  - HADOKEN!                     | =     ---------------------- {0}                                      / \                    O  ----- "I'M FROM THE NORTH, BEYOCH!!!!" (flexing muscles)                 \~|~/                    / \ Seriously folks, even http://wikipedia.org describes Chinese food to be broken down into the cuisines of  Anhui, Cantonese, Fujian, Hunan, Jiangsu, Szechuan, Zhejiang, and Shandong, of which San Tung is easily SF Bay Area's MASTER of Shandong. While I have yet to eat at the Oakland version of this restaurant, there's absolutely NOTHING south of here that even compares. For those who put down San Tung you either - don't like this style of Chinese food - ordered the wrong things - think there are better places (if so I'd love to know the equivalent and where) - hate the long lines, lack of parking in the area, and having to wait with fellow eater$ who love this food way more than you do -think this place is KOREAN CHINESE (I am so sick of this term, just call it Shandong cuisine, OK?) and all you know is ja jang mien or Jar Jar Binks. I've been going here on and off since the early 90s, just like Jason G and ton$ of ardent fan$, when this place was originally a hole in a wall further down Irving near the 20s. One of the waiters is the son of either the chef or owner. I remember him as a high school kid helping out and he's all grown up and still there! Back then there was already a huge wait if you did not get there in time. $an Tung's noodles and dumplings and cold appetizers have ALWAYS hit the spot. They had to open up San Tung #2 which is currently the only remaining location, to accomodate more customers and higher volume. While quality and the atmosphere suffered a wee bit, nobody has surpassed this Food Street Fighter King. While the menu has a good wide variety, there are a few classics I have never deviated away from, because they represent the pinnacle of Northern Chinese and arguably Taiwanese type of comfort food, great for any occa$$ion. Here's a compilation of what I've tried and re-ordered* time after time again dan dan noodles - San Tung's take on a Sichuanese classic, but this tasted nothing like what it should be. Not as much peanut flavor and something that was like either edamame and tofu in it. Weird. Good noodles as always dried fried chicken wings - maybe not KFC (Korean fried chicken) but a variant of Chinese fried chicken that's honey sweet and a bit of a spicy kick. pork and cabbage dumplings* - as good as some Shandong noodles and dumplings shop in Taipei, Taiwan, and better than the chain shops over there! Don't let the foolz tell you otherwise. I dare say I enjoy these a lot more than Kingdom of Dumplings which are even further Northern (in China) style wise. The skins have great bounce and always a pleasure. cold 5 spice beef appetizer* - thinly sliced and perfectly marinated beef flank (with tendons inside). The marination is not as salty as Beijing style, and the 5 spices marination fragrance is good. Order a plate of this and dunk it in the beef noodle soup for SEXTRA plea$ure. 5 Spice Beef Noodle Soup* - sorry naysayers, this is actually my #1 favorite beef noodle soup of all time in the Bay Area. GASP you say, A$J and A&J not close? Sorry no. The noodles here are unmistakenably classic Northern Chinese Shandong style La Mien, regardless if they were machine cut (but yes it tastes EXACTLY the way it should. Maybe Four Seasons in SJ (Korean Chinese cough cough) came close, but ST does it the best. The slurp factor of these noodles are out of this world, mildly chewy and refreshingly light, way better than the "best" ramen places (flame me go ahead, and face the wrath of San Tung). The beef tendon and flank (with strips of tendon inside) are amazing, even if not as sexy looking as some of my profile pics. OK the broth is inconsistent here, and not as deep or thick as other places, but when it is not salty, it's still good. Spinach is always a nice touch. Marinated pig's ear - not bad.  Everyday Beijing and Little Shanghai (San Mateo) do a better version. Good thick slices though. Marinated dried tofu strips - very nice rendition. The 5 spice flavors sink deep for a variant take on a classic. And yeah, their in house marinated pao tsai (kim chee). It's not like the Korean version. It tastes very fermented but also very sweet and crunchy with a strong spice kick (no sour flavor, strangely). I luv this $tuff! Nothing beats good ol' comfort $hizzle

- Z E R O - I WAS regular customer of San Tung, & been coming here for years.  Frank is great, extremely friendly.  And yes, Dry-Fried Chicken and Pot Stickers are the best.  FYI, don't ever send anything back, even if you don't like it.  They yell the shit out of their staff. We are regulars & always order the same thing, as we are creatures of habit. We ordered our usual Dry-Fried Chicken lunch special, and the Pot Stickers, something new: Braised Tofu Pork. Everything was going fine.  We are used to the fact that the Pot Stickers come toward the end of the meal...that was fine, because they are great regardless of what part of the meal they end up coming out.  The first thing that came out was the Braised Bean Curd with Pork.  Unfortunately, Angie and I both agree'd that it wasn't what we were expecting, so we told Frank's brother that we would like to exchange this dish as we felt like we ordered the wrong thing.  He responded by saying "Well, did you order it?"  In response, I say "Yes, we did, but it turned out to be something we didn't really like."  He then continues on to say, "You have to talk to your server." I found this extremely odd and rude especially since we know who he is.  But whatever, we end up telling our server that we ordered the wrong thing from the menu, and didn't like it.  We instead wanted to exchange it for the Shredded Pork with Garlic Sauce, another usual that we get.   Once mentioning that we wanted to switch our order, the server says to us that he needs to talk to the "manager" which I thought was completely weird because Frank wasn't there that day, but his rude brother was, so I knew from that moment on, that this was going to be a hassle.  To my surprise, our server comes back to us and says that they will switch our dish. Great! I was actually very surprised about this, as I know from past experience that Chinese restaurants are usually quite difficult in this situation. Dry-Fried Chicken comes out, Pot Stickers come out,  d e l i c i o u s.  But it's what happened next from Frank's brother that completely blows my mind away.  And this will forever be the absolute W O R S T  experience in my history of eating out:   Frank's brother comes to our table with a to-go menu and explains to us that their are descriptions of what is in the dish listed on the menu.  I respond to him saying "Yes, I know, but we ordered the wrong thing, and it wasn't what we expected."   From this point on, his response and actions toward us were absolutely  UNACCEPTABLE!  He continues on to say "Well, you got your waiter in trouble because he had to bring the dish back."  At this moment, I was extremely in shock that he was blaming us for the server getting in trouble.  My response to him was that " Yes, it was our fault that we ordered the wrong thing, and that the waiter really SHOULDN'T be getting into trouble because he DIDN'T do anything wrong at all.  That is completely insane, that a manager would get mad at the waiter, because the customer ordered something they didn't like. I further mentioned to Frank's brother the server really shouldn't be getting into trouble for our mistake on ordering something wrong.  But he continues on to argue with us about the fact that the waiter is in trouble.  My first thing is " I'm sorry, but why are you coming up to us and telling us the waiter is in trouble in the first place." How is a customer to fucking feel? All we wanted to do was fucking eat, and he kept standing there, yapping. Having parents who own a restaurant here in San Francisco, I know first hand, that it's very important to keep your customers-- regular and new--HAPPY.  The food industry in general is quite difficult to be in.  So I know, exactly how hard it is.  But I also understand the fact that there are times when a customer might not like what they ordered, and would like something else.  Never in a million years would I blame one of our customers for ordering the wrong dish. I mention this to him. Frank's brother was insanely out of line from this moment on.  He continues to fight with us, and I continue to agree with the fact that it was our fault for ordering something we didn't like.  I don't even know why this was an issue at all.   I made the decision that I really HAD to leave and escape this terrible experience of an employee attacking us for getting the waiter in trouble...of course in my mind, he shouldn't have.   Upon getting up to leave, he states to us "Good, if you ever come back here, I'm gonna throw you out." I throw my napkin in his face while leaving.  He continues to yell at us, making me call him  "Fat son of a bitch" as he literally is, while walking out.  My sister upset as well flicks him off with her middle finger, & tells him to tell Frank we're never coming back.   I will forever have this experience of San Tung, once a favorite of mine, now the stamped with the reputation of having the WORST restaurant sevice

At long last, I have had the famous Dry Fried Chicken Wings at San Tung. At first, I picked them up with my chopsticks and delicately nibbled on them. Before too long, I got my hands into it. By wing #3, I was virtually motorboating those things.  Chopsticks in one hand, end of the wing in other hand - and a blur of motion and happy noises. When my plate was finished, I had sticky sweet sauce all over my mouth and hands.  I licked my fingers.   I paid my $7 (wings, rice, soup and tea). I left in a daze, already dreaming of when I might have them again.  Hooked!

This place would not survive in LA. The beef noodle soup sucked!!! Expensive and bland for what it is. String beans were fine and fresh and they took over an entire family dining table in the middle of the restaurant to process them (How authentically Asian of them). Pork dumpling was unimpressive and a bit soggy, meaning that they boiled it for way too long. The "dried" fried chicken seems to be their signature dish and it was delicious. Reminds me of honey BBQ chicken from KFC but with an Asian twist. Come here before 5:30pm for dinner or you'll be crowded with all the other lemmings for this mediocre place. Rumble on in the Inner Sunset (or Eastern Mountain which is what San Tung means).

Clearly a Sunset institution, there is always a big wait. Came by last night (Thursday) around 8:30ish and still had to hang on for 30 minutes, on the weekends I hear this can stretch to hours. Followed some Yelper recommendations and went with the pork dumplings, the fried chicken, the asparagus, and some hot and sour soup. All were pretty tasty, but I can't say I had a knock-your-socks-off-this-is-worth-the-wait experience. Chicken was delicious, but it's fried chicken, hard not to be! We were seated at a giant round table along with another random group which added to our fun since they turned out to be friendly dermatologists (scored some free Botox out of the deal, ha no I didn't, but maybe I should have!).

I'm a chink - and this is the place I take my parents to when they visit.  They love it here - fresh thick homemade noodles, amazing dumplings and wontons, and fried chicken wings. With service that makes you feel like you're in China. It's all about food yo.  If I could give more than 5 stars, I would. All other chinese restaurants in the city pale in comparison to San Tung. Also try So - same owners/food but smaller portions, hipper ambiance, and good for those (Wednesday?) nights when San Tung is closed.

"Hey baby you got some Korean in you?.... Want some?" Its as if Chinese food got hit on by Korean food and they actually went home and made sweet love.   Davids bottom line- Chinese food with Korean influence.  Two of the tastiest joined together at the hip.  Korean food you stud you.  Chinese food you babe you. Chicken wings rock.

I BELIEVE IN YELP.  As I say those four words, I stand with my hand on my heart,  facing my computer, clutching my gas-x.   And because I believe in Yelp, I will probably try San Tung again even though I've been - let's call it queasy - since eating a very mediocre, not very cheap lunch here yesterday.   There are eight steamed pot stickers to an order, and I left four of them uneaten.  I then made the mistake of ordering kung pao shrimp and although the taste wasn't horrible, it wasn't that good either. Unfortunately I couldn't eat it because it smelled like a Planned Parenthood exam room at the end of a busy day.  Thankfully Andrew T. saved the meal from being a complete disaster by ordering the decent dry fried chicken. Four stars after over one thousand reviews.  That's a lot of yelpers who've enjoyed a really good meal here. I wish I'd been one of them.   * foooftt! * oops! so embarrassing - sorry!

[M]ona: 3 Stars [W]ayne 3.5 Stars Average: 3.25 Stars + Good Chicken Wings + Accepts Credit Cards - No Parking - Long Wait - Crampy - Not a good place to eat if you can't handle spicy [W] Ok we'll get all the negatives out first. NO PARKING, long wait times, and can be VERY crowded and noisy. People always tell me that this is the place to be to get dumplings and kimchee. Honestly for me, their dumplings don't really hit the spot for my palate. Also their kimchee is a hit and miss. Sometimes it's really good, and sometimes it's really bad. Good as in just spicy and sweet enough for you to crave more. Sometimes it's sooooo damn spicy you can't even eat and taste anything. So I have mixed feelings about that. [M] This time, Wayne and I shared their Dry Fried Chicken Wings http://www.yelp.com/biz_… and Spicy Beef with Baby Cornshttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/M0JTO3oyu6gxh1­mfFjU-dA?select=nXQohgrc61CcrI1XZ3I2Tg. The two dishes were actually pretty good and wouldn't mind ordering them again. The wings were nice and crispy as usual and with a sweet honey glaze on the skin. You can also order them without the glaze. The beef was juicy and tender but a little on the spicy side. [W] Try this place out if you like spicy foods because they have quite a few dishes that have some kick to it. Just make sure you go at a time when they're not busy, which is rare other than in the late afternoon. Also remember to ask for a lot of water because that kimchee will kick you in the butt!

Since the first review, we dined here many times and all good experiences!  The last time we went here we were once again lucky and snagged a parking spot nearby.  I know how hard it is to get parking in these neighborhoods....it can be hell and this area is no exception!  If I lived in the city, I would just take the muni. Here is what we tried recently: 1. Pork Dumplings - 12 little white dumplings filled with ground pork, napa cabbage & seasoned with fresh ginger and garlic 2.Three Deluxe Spicy Sauce Noodles - stir fried shrimp, calamari, scallops, zucchini strips and onions in a spicy sauce served over homemade noodles 3. Tomato Eggflower Soup - shrimp, mushrooms, peas, spinach, , diced tomatoes in an egg flower drop soup 4. Curry Beef - stir fried tender beef in a rich yellow curry sauce with bell peppers and carrot coins. 5. Dry Fried Chicken - we opted for the wings - batter coated chicken wings deep fried and sauted in a spicy garlic sauce 6. Steamed rice 7. Hot tea and iced water These descriptions, by the way, are straight from their menu.  I have to say of the five entree items we ordered plus steamed white rice, the Curry Beef was the least favored new item.  It lacked the depth that I usually find in curry and was pretty much lackluster....will not order this again.   However the other dishes really shined!  I liked the Three Deluxe Spicy Sauce Noodles and the Tomato Eggflower Soup best. These new selections were really delicious...on the noodle dish...word of warning...if you like your spicy noodles on the "mild spicy" it will not come out that way....we asked for "medium" spicy and while we enjoyed it, it was more like "high" on the spicy scale.  One of our dining companions liked it so much but because it was too spicy for his taste, he declined a second helping even though he loved it! Parking can be hellish but keep an open mind and eye.....you'll find a spot soon enough!

Northern Chinese cuisine is all about the noodles and dumplings as well as cooking heavily with spices. My family has been coming to San Tung for a little something different from the abundance of southern Chinese restaurants in the city since they had the smaller shop in outer sunset. Some of our favorites include shrimp and leek dumplings, pork dumplings, black bean sauce noodles, and beef noodle soup. But nothing, absolute nothing, on the menu beats those highly addictive chicken wings. Spicy, tangy brown marinade laced over pieces of dry fried chicken wings keeps me always wanting to come back for more. Needless to say, everything they dry fry and layered with the brown marinade is fantastic!

I'm just floored by how utterly butt ass this is. Here's my theory on why this place has such a high rating.  It's riding on its Yelp momentum.  People see that it has a million 5-star ratings, triggering an automatic subconscious thought that it MUST be good.  This is the response that prevents them from giving anything less than 4 stars, regardless of how truly appalling it may be.  This is one of those legendary Yelp places that gets at least 4 stars even before you walk in the door, just for being a Yelp legend.   Well, I don't think that's fair or just and I'm gonna speak up about it.  Just like we did when they served us the most disgustingly greasy, oily mongolian beef I've ever had, which also had absolutely no flavor by the way.  And the mu shu chicken. Well, it should have just been called mu shu oil and cabbage, cuz the chicken was not in attendance, and the pancakes were basically heavy, oily, pan fried flour tortillas.  And the grand finale: the lemon chicken.  This was basically deep fried chunks of batter swimming in a thick, mucous-like artificial lemon flavored goo.  Where was the chicken here? Absent.  Most of it was literally just batter and goo.  They should have called this goo dumplings. And then when mom complained, painstakingly identifying the flaws of each and every dish, they wanted to negotiate on how much of the bill we should pay, taking us through a series of offers and counter-offers.  Just ridiculous.  And tacky. So there you have it.  The ugly, tasteless truth about San Tung Restaurant #2. Update 12/16/06:  A couple of fellow Yelpers have informed me that I "ordered wrong" when I ate here.  This argument is so easy to counter its almost not worth it at all, but the reality is, if its *that* good, and worthy of so many raving 5 star reviews, then it stands to reason that every single dish would be consistently heavenly, and there would be no risk of getting a dish they are notorious for making poorly.  That lack of consistency is one sign of a mediocre restaurant, I'm afraid.

And get there early, if you don't like waiting.  (You also gotta be up with a ninja-quickness on the parking, cause it can be challenging once San Tung gets busy.  I pulled my Southern California driving skills out and snagged a spot directly across from San Tung.  Eat tailpipe, bitches!!)

Usually Santa forgets to bring me presents. I mean, I'm a Jew and all, but I still like Christmas cheer. I buy wreaths and download "Baby it's Cold Outside" onto my ipod, so you'd think he might want to put me on the Nice list. He used to visit when I was little, although he would only bring me school supplies, like glue sticks, and doll house people. But still, I really appreciated that he thought of me. It's been a while since Jolly Saint Nick paid me a visit, but he must have noticed what a crap-filled 2007 I've had and decided to give me a break. "Well, that heathen sassy girl has had a craptastic, unemployed, penny-less, cry-snotting few months, ahhhhh, what the heck, I'll give her some fuzzy socks, a Sonicare toothbrush and some kick-ass Chinese food." The socks are dope and the toothbrush makes my crooked-effed-up by-my-worthless-orthodontist-teeth sparkle like a Myspace glitter icon, but the Chinese food was like a shiny new car, or job, or shoes, or, you get the point. The wait to be seated was cold and crowded, but the sizzling rice soup and shrimp and leak dumplings warmed my insides and tugged on my heartstrings. The grizzly waiter literally threw our plates with gusto at our table, but the garlic spinach erased the memory of the bitter server and spread around a healthy dose of warm fuzzies. The screaming, hungry children who sounded oddly like Chucky from "Child's Play" were like shrill train whistles, but the black bean chicken and prawns with garlic sauce were intoxicating, like a good dirty martini that makes all irritating sounds into comforting white noise. Santa did good this year. Instead of ignoring me as he has done every year since I was 7, he gave me the gift of San Tung, the best Chinese food that has ever hit these sassy lips.

2 words: yummy deliciousness!!! The dry fried chicken wings are soooo good. We love the chicken so much that we ordered the boneless ones and the boned ones. The wings tastes better but theres less to eat. The string beans were pretty good too. The sauce tastes like the sauce they use for the chicken but more watery. We also ordered noodle with peanut sauce, dry black bean sauce noodle and seafood noodle soup. The noodle with peanut sauce is hella good. I don't really like black bean sauce noodle but it's actually pretty good here, although I don't think its better than the peanut sauce noodle. The seafood noodle soup was just so so. I didn't want to eat that since we ordered some much more yummy dishes.

I HEART San Tung. So, why has it taken me 2 freaking years to FINALLY write a review for San Tung? I'm back on my stupid lo-carb diet to fit into my NYE dress and craving their Dry Fried Chicken Wings like there's no tomorrow. So, what's the best way to get over the craving? YELP ABOUT IT! I first heard about San Tung from my ex's sister. And, ever since I bit into those luscious wings, it was love at first bite. Below are some of things I've tried: FOOD: *Original Dry Fried Chicken Wings: This is the STAR menu item at San Tung. If you ain't coming for the wings; don't bother coming in at all! One word that describes the wings is "ORGASMIC". The large succulent chicken wings are fried in a light batter and then tossed in a thick sweet, savory, spicy concoction of ginger, garlic, and chili pepper flakes that sticks to the fried batter. Sooo effen good! Talk about amazing flavor combos!  I've been to San Tung about 10-12 times, and the wing are consistently good--the chicken is always flavorful and tender. *Potstickers: The BEST potstickers EVER! These handmade babies are gigantic! It's pan fried to a perfect golden brown on the bottom, but it's crispy throughout. It's generously filled with cabbage and pork w/ a slight hint of ginger. The red vinegar is a perfect compliment as it adds a zing to the potsticker. BE CAFEFUL though, those things are piping hot when they come to your table. *Dry Sautéed Green Beans: Can veggies really taste this good? O yes, they CAN! The string beans are flash fried and then tossed into a thick garlicky sauce. The sauce is just thick enough to coat the beans which is cooked al-dente. The chili pepper flakes gives the dish a nice kick! *Dry Fried Beef: This is similar to the Original Fried Chicken dish, but just made with beef. The beef is flash fried and then tossed into the same garlicky, ginger, chili sauce as the chicken. The beef is slightly crispy on the outside and very tender! *Black Bean Sauce Noodles w/ sliced beef, shrimp, and calamari in a dark soybean sauce: I normally HATE black bean sauce. This can be attributed to my mom's horrid cooking where she would put so much black bean sauce that it would over power the dish. But, wow, this had be converted. The black bean sauce wasn't as salty as I thought it would be and had a slight sweetness to it. It tasted like eating a cold version of chow mein, but since the noodles were home-made it had a very different texture. It had more of a bite to it. Everything in this dish was super fresh and flavorful! * Noodles with Peanut Sauce: Give me anything smothered in peanut sauce and call it a day! Noodles covered in slightly spicy peanut sauce w/ fresh shrimp and scallops? YUMMY! *Mongolian Beef: This is a good alternative to ordering other fried dishes at San Tung. It's similar to the Dry Fried Beef except it's wok-fried and not as oily. The beef is tender and is perfectly seasoned. The onions and red bell peppers which is very fresh and not overcooked give the dish great flavor and crunch. *Shantung House Shrimps: This was a recommendation from the waiter! Whole jumbo shrimps fried and then tossed in garlic sauce? *Drool* The shrimp was massive and was very sweet and tender. The sauce nicely coated the shrimp's shell, so you get a hint of good flavor, but still can taste the natural sweetness of the shrimp. The best part? Ripping off the head and sucking out all the brainy goodness!!! YUM! :) *Sauteed Scallops: Another good alternative to the other fired menu items. The scallops are fresh and tender. They are perfectly sautéed in a flavorful ginger and garlic sauce with fresh and sweet snow peas. *Garlic Flavored Eggplant: YUMMY! The eggplant is tender and the garlicky sauce gently coats the eggplant which gives it a good garlicy kick! SERVICE: There's always a WAIT at Sun Tung, so be prepared for a 20-45 minute wait during the weekend nights. If you have a party of 7 or more, you can call in and have them put your name on the board. The service itself is similar to the typical Asian joint. You order, get your food, hail if you need something, and when you're done; get your bill. PARKING: Parking is terrible around this area b/c San Tung is in a vicinity of  many other restaurants and local businesses. Try parking towards the Andronico's about 2 blocks away since it's away from 9th and 10th Avenues where it's gets very busy. AMBIANCE: There's not much to it. It's loud and bustling. You will see a lot of happy faces there b/c they are satisfying their crack feen with the wings! San Tung, until we meet again...hopefully, sometime soon in the near future.

Over 2000 reviews?!?!  Wow, that's a lot of chicken wings.  Which is what everyone seems to be raving about.  Including myself. The sweet and spicy sauce doesn't seem to be any sort of magical concoction, but it is when paired with the fantastically crispy, deep fried wings that creates a delicious cacophony of flavours and textures.  There's some sort of weird, mystical element to that dish that compels you to perpetually pop another wing or leg into your mouth, one after the other, in some sort of futile attempt to satisfy a craving that cannot be quenched. I was also a big fan of the dumplings, but less so impressed with their noodle offerings.  But pile up a table before me full of their wings and dumplings?  You will find before you a very very happy happy man indeed.

The consistency of the noodles and the taste were super good. I was seriously in love with those noodles, after everyone was full, I was still picking out every noodle. The broth was yummy and the well seasoned. -Dried Chicken Wings: 5 STARS. These honey glazed lil wings were super yummy and i could have literally eaten a plates of them. -Wet Chicken Wings: 3 STARS, Compared to the dry wings these just reallie weren't that good, it didn't stand out for me. -Curry Beef: 3 STARS. Nothing reallie special with this dish, tastes like any other restaurant's curry beef. I wont order this next time around. -Deep Fried Calamari: 5 STARS. Like the Dry Chicken Wings these are glazed with honey and packed with flavor. mmm mmm mmm yummy To sum everything up: -Be prepared to wait, trust me you will wait a long time in order to get seated. Hence we waiting at 6pm, which is way toooo early of a dinner for me, but i made sure to eat super light during that day -If you expect great service: Ur SOL, cuz its always super busy and the waiters are always running, u gotta flag em down! -Word of advice: choose wat u want before u get in, u have plenty of time while u are waiting. Once the waiter comes! BAM! ORDER! ORDER! ORDER! cuz it mite be a while before he passes your table again -Lastly come here to enjoy the food and nothing else! ENJOY!

Sometimes things are just better the second time around, and this time San Tung was!  Last week I was sick & bf wanted me to have some soup.  I didn't want pho & I had won ton noodle soup from Fat Wong's the night before.  So, I decided to give San Tung another chance, since I wanted some homemade noodle soup!   We ordered: the beef noodle soup, dry fried chicken wings & shrimp fried rice.  The wings were a lot crispier the second time around.  I still like SO's wings better though because I like the spicier better than the sweet, bf says they're still crispier too.   But they were still finger licking good.  The beef noodle soup's broth was nice and not salty.  They weren't stingy with the beef and gave a whole mess of noodles though, which needed more broth. The shrimp fried rice continues to be more flavorful than most places, but seemed better the first time around IMO. You get a one star upgrade from me San Tung.  If only I could either a. get out of the house earlier to eat early at 11 to avoid the crowds & b. if only parking were easier around that area.....until then I'll continue to get to go when the craving hits & we're too lazy to drive to SO.

I'm smitten. What an awesome little restaurant! I went for lunch today with two friends who are regulars. We were seated at a communal table with a handsome and charming visitor from Sacramento who not only made our meal that much more enjoyable but also joined me in surrendering to the ordering powers of my friends. The girls chose: * Shrimp and leek dumplings...with a burst of briny flavor and especially nice with chili sauce and Chinese mustard * Homemade noodles with tomato and beef...possibly the best chow mein noodles I've ever had * String beans...perfectly crunchy and in a garlicky sauce perfect for sopping up with rice * The house specialty fried chicken...dry-fried and unbelievably delicious with its crispy, crunchy, sweet and spicy skin If San Tung weren't on the other side of town from where I live it would absolutely become a weekly haunt. This is daydream-worthy food and a great value: The four of us got stuffed and still had lots of leftovers for only $54.

Sometimes it pays to know people. You dont have to wait in line. You can hop onto other awesome peoples tables and dine with people who know what to order. You can make sure there are enough chicken wings to go around. You can realize that next time if you come...and there is a wait...its probably going to be worth it. Especially when you are the only white people in the place.  It must be good Also...who knew that it was possible to talk on your cell phone your ENTIRE meal.  Seriously...watched a kid do it.  Eat and talk, all the way out the door.  Rude...but fascinating.

WAY too packed all the time but the food makes up for it. They serve the best fried chicken wings I've ever eaten, even better then my moms! Even if I was on a really strict diet, I would break it just for that. We came here last night for a birthday dinner and I couldn't believe how busy they were. Lots of big groups dining and some celebrating their birthdays too. Some dishes I tried were the Mongolian beef - sliced tender beef sauteed with green onions and roasted red peppers in their house sauce Pork with green onions - sauteed shredded pork with jalapenos, onions in a light garlic sauce Garlic chicken - diced chicken stir fried with generous portion of garlic and water chestnuts in a garlic sauce..   Tomato beef chow mein - fried soft noodles with veggies Pot stickers, some shrimp dish and some more noodle dishes. Everything was good but service was on the slow side... Understandable though since they were super busy! TRY THE FRIED CHICKEN WINGS!

There is always a huge long line out of this place. I've eaten there once and, I don't know, I didn't think it was all that great. It's cheap though. I think that's why everyone comes! We had a party of 10 and the waiter was super super rude (like to the point of it being laughable) and impatient. The sauce for the wings was good. I had a green bean dish that was good/ok--nothing to rave about. Good food, nothing to get super excited about.

Damn, when the Yelp posse collectively decides they like a restaurant, let me tell you, that is one lucky restaurant. San Tung has a four star average over 1700 reviews & counting and a following that is evident in the crowds standing at their door. Sunday evening, we arrive around 6 pm, were the 2nd party to write our name down on the white dry-erase board & were seated almost immediately (had we arrived ten minutes later, our wait would have been over an hour long. Talk about good timing.) The sense of urgency at ST is intense; our waiter was ready to give away our table because I hesitated a nanosecond before raising my hand when he hollered my name! We ordered their dry fried chicken diced (instead of the wings) & asked for all white meat. When our dish arrived, the waiter (who reminded me of a Chinese version of the Soup Nazi for some reason) yelled "white meat! white meat!" I was thinking, even if I didn't order white meat, I'd just nod my head & take whatever he served us because this dude's voice was intimidating! FYI: I like when my waiter puts me in my place; makes me feel like we are on a sitcom. The diced dry fried chicken ($9) had nice, big chunks as well crispy little pieces sitting in their spicy garlic sauce; "Dry" is not completely dry. As messy as wings are, I think I would have preferred the less fried meat on them. We also ordered shrimp & leek dumplings (pretty good) & sweet & sour beef (candied to death in their fake bright red corn starch sauce.) I enjoyed their fried rice, which didn't need extra soy sauce. The complimentary kimchi they serve is horrible, rank, one if the worse kimchis I've tasted. Total was $40 (not including tip.)  We'll be back. I like the hustle & bustle of this place. It's entertaining.

OMG!  The best Chinese food around.  My favorites are: dry fried beef, chicken fried rice, and the moo shu chicken ALL DELICIOUS.  I have never tried the chicken wings- but they're definitely popular and look yummy.  Yes, there is always at least a 30 minute wait, but it is always worth it.

I was hyped about this place because: 1) all the Yelp reviews 2) the threads about KFC (korean fried chicken - though it's a Chinese place) 3) sis had been here 3 times within a month First, the wait was a biaaayatch.  I even had to regulate when another customer, tired of the wait and already on the list, tried to sign her party up right before mine.  After I pointed out that she was not signing up at the end of the list, she quickly crossed her name out and slinked away. Also, noise is an issue - I would venture to say that it was louder in there than a typical Chinese restaurant.  I think it gave me a headache. Once seated, we ordered shrimp and leak dumplings, black bean sauce noodles, dry fried chicken (both wings/drumsticks and diced), and string beans.  The dumplings were great but a little salty.  Honestly, I have had similar dumplings that were frozen!  There was barely any *stuff* in the black bean sauce noodles - they weren't kidding about the sauce!  I think each of us (party of 5) got one piece of something - whether it was shrimp, beef, or squid.  I prefer my mom's homemade kind!  The dry fried chicken - I recommend on the bone and not diced - but we tried both.  The diced kind reminded me of orange chicken - I kid you not.  And finally, the string beans - not reviewable because when we were almost done with the meal, a waiter showed up and told us that they're out.  GRR. They get three stars because the meal was not blow-your-socks off.  Since I live on the Peninsula and my family in the East Bay, the food simply did not make the drive, the wait, or the noise worth it.  My personal family favorite (for authentic delicious Chinese) is still Great China in Berkeley.  So I'll be one less party you have to wait behind. But what do I know?  Check it out for yourself.

3.5 stars rounded down for 1) mediocre service 2) ambiance (crowded!) 3) looooooooong wait. We came here on a Saturday night (around 6:30), put our names down, and went to get boba at Tea Way, as the wait would be long and arduous otherwise. It ended up being a bit under an hour I am guessing. We had plenty of time to drive off, get self-serve tea, drink it all, take cute pictures, and drive back...and we waited some more of course (maybe 15 min more) when we got back. We ended up ordering steamed dumplings (http://static1.px.yelpcd…) and cold noodles (http://static1.px.yelpcd…) between the two of us. The waiter complained that we ordered too little, but come on. We are two petite Asian girls who just drank full cups of boba. I thought 2 dishes for 2 girls was quite appropriate...it did turn out to be the perfect amount. As for the food, the pork dumplings were really delicious! I can make dumplings though too, so I am not sure how impressed I was :P The cold noodles were awesomely chewy (handpulled noodles ftw). All the veggies, meats, shrimp, etc in the dish were exceedingly fresh. My problem with the dish, however, was that the sauce was way too sweet. I think I prefer sesame-based cold noodles when it comes to Chinese stuff. It felt weird eating this... All-in-all, pretty good stuff but not worth the wait! I'd probably just go somewhere else with handpulled noodles and make my own dumplings. The amusing part of the night was when K told me that the waiter told her that her totoro (as pictured in the food images) was "beautiful."

Finally made it in here after being rejected from the typical long waits.  My gf and I came in for dinner around 5:30 PM and in about 30 minutes there was a line out the door. Of course we had to order the dry fried chicken wings, dry fired green beens, and the black bean noodles.  Like Christine L.'s review, the dishes are a little too sweet but they are definitely good.   The sauce on the chicken wings are like crack.  I started to dip my green beans in the sauce and poured some on top of my noodles.  This is a place where you go to twice a year but will recommend to others to try.

Took a friend here recently for dinner and learned something new: If there is a wait (which there will always be), do not stand outside.  If possible, wait indoors.  The waiter would nonchalantly call out your name once, twice if he's feeling generous, and erase it at no response.  He didn't even bother to open the door to call out the name.   30 minutes of your hard-earned waiting can easily be swiped away by his mighty hand if you're not on your toes to claim your spot.

The line that spills out onto the sidewalk should be your first hint that this place is a winner. Ignore the line, then gently bob and weave your way inside and place your name on the little white dry-erase board. Step back and start some conversations you might be in for a 30 minute wait, on a weekday, for a table you will share with strangers, and it will be worth it. I came here with Yelp Miami Elite pioneer and now Palo Alto Elite Rob C. He helped me navigate my first foray into the wild world of Chinese chicken wings. Both the dry and wet version were good but I think I'd take the dry. Still for me what made even more of a memorable impression on my taste buds were the black bean noodles. Sadly, I didn't sample dumplings.... there's always a next time.

Dry fry wings, so hot, so crunchy, so sticky sweet! My LOVE of fried chicken hit a gluttonous low (or high? it's all relative I guess) when I enthusiastically agreed to a third order of wings (that was a total of one order of 13 wings per person) despite my stomach telling me that it was on its way to Fat-Pants Town.  Interestingly, the last batch that we ordered tasted very different form the first two; too much white pepper. Uh, yeah I ate it up anyway. We also had some dumplings, which I found to be juicy and tasty. The mushroom/mixed veggies that we ordered in our disingenuous attempt to have a "balanced meal" were quite bland. I wouldn't order that again. And who am I kidding, you go to San Tung for the wings. Next time I will save the veggies for the next day when I am hating myself for eating so damn much.

4.5 stars This is some of the best Chinese food I've had anywhere in the U.S.  Forget Chinatown, Irving Street is where it's at.  We were the only non-Asians in the joint - good sign.  Servers spoke Mandarin with the other tables, but they had no problems communicating in English with us guai lo. We tried as many different dishes as we could. The pork dumplings are unbelievable.  Pan fried or steamed both good, but I prefer the steamed.  Could've housed dozens of those in one sitting - no doubt.  The consistency of the pork inside reminded me of North Carolina pulled pork - not that nasty solid ball of compressed pork product found in dumplings at other places.   We also had some veg dumplings that were quite tasty which surprised me because I am more of a meatitarian. Yung Chow fried rice was lights out.  Big chunks of squid, beef, shrimp, and fresh well-cooked veg. The noodles were very, very good - some of the best I've had.  You can really taste the love put into the noodles.  If you hold the noodles up to the light you see their surface is not smooth but rough with little jags created during the handpulling process.  Got one bowl with black bean sauce and chicken and another with a spicy seafood broth and tons of fresh seafood. Dry fried beef and chicken wings were both quite tasty.  Kind of a crunchy breaded sweet (but not too sweet) and tangy.  The table loved the beef but I loved the wings and believe I polished off 12 of them. I didn't think service was as bad as others have yelped.  They were fairly attentive, and definitely helpful - they just so damn busy.   We got there at about 11:30am on Saturday and got one of the last tables before the line started forming.  It was half block long when we left.

Chose to come here at 1pm on New Years eve. BAD IDEA Parking was horrible. Drove 5-6 blocks around the area for 30+ minutes to find parking. Finally settled on Lincoln and 14th but never again will I come on a weekend  during the middle of lunch. I hate looking for parking in busy areas and it was just a nightmare. Almost decided to just go home instead. Next time I would rather come super or early or late. OR take public transportation. Anyways, on to the food. There was 3 of us and we ordered 3 dishes. It was a good amount of food for the three of us and we paid $12 each at the end. - the dried fried chicken wings Its covered in a very sweet sticky sauce that is finger licking good. Great dish if you're not concerned about your arteries.     - the dried fried string beans Pretty sured these were deep fried too but sooo good. Can't have this everyday either though. Sauce was delicious, similar to the chicken sauce but I didn't really care enough to seriously compare them. Got a crispy unidentified thing with a string bean that was delicious but I couldn't really identify what it was because my energy had been wasted on trying to find parking. - zha jiang mian/black bean sauce noodles (dry) Kinda bland compared to the chicken and string beans. Veggies in it were clearly deep fried as well because it was saturated with oil and because it also left a pool of oil in the bowl. I liked the noodles though. Perfectly cooked but that sauce was a real disappointment. We didn't finish it. As it got colder more oil appeared. Not great. Wouldn't recommend it. Conclusion- string beans and chicken were finger licking good but this is definitely an once a year kind of thing for those who are concerned with their health. Atmosphere- super loud, I mean, my energy for the day was already spent looking for parking and I did not want to have to raise my voice to talk to people sitting just across from me.

Dry fried chicken wings are off the heezy fo' sheezy!!! http://static.px.yelp.co… So crispy with a nice sweetness to it. I can't wait to go back next month and have some more!!! The eggplant was good too! http://static.px.yelp.co… Had an interesting flavor that's a bit vinegary. Expect a wait but you can call in ahead of time to try and put your name on the waiting list.

After waiting to go to this place for months, I finally got the chance to try what everyone has been raving about, their wings.  I must say, i wasn't disappointed. Original Dry fried wings. Some of the best wings I've ever had.  I could probably eat that stuff everyday and not get sick of it. Pork dumplings were good, nothing special.  I'm just giving this place 5 stars for their wings.  The service was okay, but mediocre service is expected at asian restaurants.   *If you get there after 6pm, good luck with the wait.

Out of all the ethnic foods, certainly none has been more bastardized in America than Chinese food.  Not sure how that happened, though I suspect that early Chinese restaurant owners cleverly realized that what fat Americans really want is breaded, deep fried meat covered in syrup, then rode that idea all the way to the bank.  And hell, I used to be one of those Americans.  General Tso's Chicken...I couldn't stop eating it.  Now that I know better, I still think of it as a guilty pleasure, but it saddens me to think of the millions out there in suburbia who still don't know they've been fooled.       Enter San Tung, by whose miraculous food I am able to enjoy the insane deliciousness with none of the guilt.  Now I can have Dry Fried Beef, which transcends the authentic/americanized divide and truly reconciles the simple with the sublime.  And wait till you get a load of the hand-pulled noodles.  Finally, a peanut sauce that isn't sickening.   Long story short, this place is a must must MUST.  Also, save yourself the trouble of waiting in line and make a reservation.

It was passable.  Noodles were decent, but A&J is way better.  They were simply not chewy enough.  I think they need to use slightly higher gluten flour.  They used the same flour for their dumplings, which were the same way.  And they don't sell the dumplings frozen!  what's up with that?!? The za jiang mian was brown, and the sauce tasted right--this is good.  no weird ink-black type with a weird taste like I had at some other korean run restaurant.  My only complaint was, I seriously prefer the standard ground pork and dried tofu type of za jiang mian.  I didn't really dig all the seafood they threw in...as well as the beef slices and potato (!?) chunks.  It was passable, but not the true za jiang mian I was looking for.  I even asked the waiter if the noodles were chinese or korean style and he said korean style. I had a bit of my companion's beef noodle soup, and it was decent.  Again, nothing to write home about.  No thin layer of chili oil on top.  The beef and soup were both lacking spice I think... and there was no real kick at all.  The beef may have been a little overcooked as well, though there was a good amount of beef tendon (a good thing). The shrimp-chive dumplings were ok.  But they did not blow me away.  The dumplings at Grace Garden in Burlingame were way better--a shandong restaurant that is much more authentic. The famous dry fry chicken... was too sweet and needed more spice, but otherwise was tasty.  Those of you that like this, should try to get some la-zi-ji (chili pepper chicken) which is how the sichuan folk do it.   Overall, I think it passes.  It's authentic enough that I was not disgusted by everything, but it's nowhere near A&J level for noodles, nowhere near Grace Garden level for dumplings.

What a great restaurant!!!  I was there when they first had their hole in the wall restaurant on 24th and Irving.  James, Frank, Charles, and the mom.  Know them all from the beginning.  It's great to see friends succeed.   Getting back to the food.  The best potstickers in the city by far.  Gotta do the dry fried chicken.  Hot and sour soup.  three deluxe spicy sauce noodles.  Man.............getting hungry just writing about it.   You really can't go wrong ordering anything here.  There are no misses on the menu.   May be hard for some people to do but don't go during peak hours.  You will definitely wait but even if you did have to wait.............it's well worth it.

Sorry guys. You said try the San Tung, it's awesome for its chicken wings and five spice beef noodle soup, so I tried one day on the way home from work, when I was starving... The dry fried chicken wings: decent, if on the super sweet, "OMG it's dipped in honey-coated jelly beans" side -- they use an interesting caramel-garlic-onion flavored sauce. When they brought it out, I was like, "Excuse me, I ordered the dry chicken wings." She looks at me, looks at the plate: "These are dry." I look at the plate -- it's swimming in sauce: "...okay..." Are the wet fried chicken wings on the menu served in a soup? $8 also seems overpriced for chicken wings that I can get for $4 at other Chinese restaurants in the area. As for the five spice beef noodle soup: I can see why there are tons of restaurants that exclusively serve Vietnamese pho, I can see why there restaurants that exclusively serve Japanese ramen, and I can see why there aren't restaurants here that exclusively serve Taiwanese beef noodle soup. The beef noodle soup here runs on the bland side, as others have commented. The beef with tendons is solid -- no complaints. The wheat noodles could be firmer. But the real travesty is the broth, the foundation of every bowl. Noodle soup is made or broken by the broth. And this broth is a hollow tasting, watery, and runs on the sugary sweet side. The garlic spinach they toss in on top seems like an aside. I couldn't finish more than half of my bowl. Chinese cuisine has so much more to offer in terms of noodle soups. Cantonese duck leg noodle soup. Malaysian laksa. Vietnamese hu tieu mi (borrowed from the Chinese and made their own, as the Japanese did with ramen). I would hold up Vietnamese bun bo Hue as similar to Taiwanese beef noodle soup, but far more flavorful. As for the restaurant service, it was very fast and very clean -- to be expected for this Chinese restaurant in the trendy Inner Sunset where the large majority of the clientele is not Chinese. Compared to the Chinese family style restaurants I usually frequent, this place is immaculate. There's twice the wait staff, and every one of them speaks English. I'll be back, but not for the soup. I'll keep this place in mind when I'm taking out friends and family who aren't down with assorted foods served with heads still on... P.S. This place seems like a strange Northern Chinese-Korean mix, but the Korean influence isn't very strong. (The wait staff is Cantonese). Everything is far too sweet for typical Chinese fair. They bring out a dish of kimchi and tea when you sit down. It's the least satisfying kimchi I've ever had the displeasure to taste... sugary sweet, sweeter than most coleslaw even, not salty, not pickled, barely spicy, aged maybe a day or two at best. I don't know why they'd want to give this to people as the first impression of their food. P.P.S. Chalking this up as another reinforcement to my belief that Inner Sunset restos are highly overrated because of the trendy location.

My quest for 5-star Chinese food has ended - thanks to Jolie L for her recommendation! They were consistently good in all areas - menu options, taste, value, service, ambiance. For once, I liked everything I ordered. This never happens to me. - Dried fried chicken wings: Their signature dish. These wings had a light, sweet glaze and the dried red peppers added some kick. It would be a crime to come here and not order these. - Pork dumplings: Forget the soy sauce. These juicy little dumplings packed enough flavor on their own. The wrapper wasn't too thick, either. Not as great as Kingdom of Dumpling, but a close contender. - Fried rice was fluffy and not too salty, and the vegetarian egg rolls were crispy and not too greasy. The cabbage and carrots in the egg rolls were crispy, too. I also loved... Great service: They packed my leftovers in the to-go box - yes! I've been so disappointed at other places who make me pack my own food. These guys were attentive without helicoptering over our table. When we asked for something (water, tea, the check) they delivered quickly. Clean and spacious: Plenty of tables meant lots of elbow room. And the place is clean. It didn't reek of fried foods or fish, like some Chinese restaurants. Even their bathroom was clean! Good value: My bill was $37 including tax and tip, and I have leftovers galore. I don't ask for much. I think the hardest thing to find is consistency. San Tung hit the mark this time, but the real test is whether they'll hold up over time. Must do further research and report back!

We came here minutes before they opened and was able to get a table right away.. Its a good thing because by the time we left, the restaurant was packed.  Parking may be a challenge because of the area.  Park a block away to avoid paying the city of SF Dept of Parking.   We ordered the dried fried chicken wings, dumplings and noodles in black bean sauce.  Everything was great. The dumplings were average.  Prices were fair, all under $10 bucks.  Service was typical of asian restaurants.

#36 on the 7x7 List: Dry-fried chicken wings -Tasty?  Perfectly fried chicken wings with a bit of a sweet sauce. -Service:  The wait staff is pretty quick and efficient.   The refilling of our teapot was like magic.  I didn't even see them bring a fresh pot back!  They are also pretty keen.  One look at the waiters and they immediately come over.  Amazing. -Ambiance:  yet another Chinese place that invests its money in the chef / food and not on the walls.  It's a paper napkins and disposable chopsticks kind of place - for sanitary reasons.  It's not ghetto. -Worth the trip/try?  For me, it was a half-hour ride on the Muni (71-Noriega to be exact).  I would say that it was worth the trip for us to share some good grub with a long-time friend. -------- We also had the Noodles with black bean sauce (ja jerng mein) - it was pretty good but nothing too special. The Potstickers were fried perfectly golden brown.  You can create your own dipping sauce with the different bottles of condiments on your table The three of us finished the three orders of food and had room for more, so we ordered the Cherry Pork.  It's like sweet and sour pork and it makes white rice taste so good. Great place for Chinese grub far far away from the tourist-infested Chinatown
